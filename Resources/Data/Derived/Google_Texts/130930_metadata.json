A group of Afghan surgeons led by Ahmad Obaid Mojadidi were able to perform a risky but ultimately life-saving operation to remove the extra head. The child was released from the hospital a few days ago.\n\nHer mother had given birth to twins, one of whom was born healthy. Asree Gul had not developed properly while she was in the womb, although doctors are unsure of what caused a second head to develop \u2013 they have speculated that it may have been the result of a third baby who had failed to develop completely.\n\nChief surgeon Ahmad Obaid Mojadidi said that it may have been one of the most sophisticated operations to take place in the impoverished city of Jalalabad. The surgery involved operating around the vital blood vessels that attached Asree Gul\u2019s skull to the extra head.\n\nThree month old Asree Gul and her twin sister at a Jalalabad hospital. Getty\n\nMojadidi told BBC that the operation was \u201cthe first of its kind in Afghanistan\u2019s east\u201d even though they didn\u2019t have very developed equipment. Asree Gul\u2019s father, Nematullah, had not expected his daughter to live. \u201cThe doctors saved her life. I thank them,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nBecause the baby\u2019s parents, who are farmers, were too poor to afford the $5,000 operation, doctors performed it for free. Her parents had brought her to the hospital after she had experienced trouble sleeping from the pressure of the extra head, and after villagers had begun making comments about her deformity.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "afghan doctors, extra head, asree gul", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Afghan surgeons performed a risky operation on a Asree Gul, a baby girl who was born with an extra head attached to her own.", "title": "Doctors Remove Extra Head From Baby Afghan Girl", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/doctors-remove-extra-head-baby-afghan-girl-asree-gul-citys-most-sophisticated-operation-photos", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/28/three-month-old-asree-gul-hospital-eastern-afghanistan-city-jalalabad-2306348.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Afghan surgeons performed a risky operation on a Asree Gul, a baby girl who was born with an extra head attached to her own.", "title": "Doctors Remove Extra Head From Baby Afghan Girl", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/doctors-remove-extra-head-baby-afghan-girl-asree-gul-citys-most-sophisticated-operation-photos", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/28/three-month-old-asree-gul-hospital-eastern-afghanistan-city-jalalabad-2306348.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/28/three-month-old-asree-gul-hospital-eastern-afghanistan-city-jalalabad-2306348.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-09-28T14:41:47-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-28T14:41:46-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Afghan surgeons performed a risky operation on a Asree Gul, a baby girl who was born with an extra head attached to her own."}, "article_summary": "A group of Afghan surgeons led by Ahmad Obaid Mojadidi were able to perform a risky but ultimately life-saving operation to remove the extra head.\nA 3-month old girl named Asree Gul was admitted to Nangarhar hospital in the Afghan city of Jalalabad, with an extra head attached to her scalp.\nBecause the baby\u2019s parents, who are farmers, were too poor to afford the $5,000 operation, doctors performed it for free.\nThe surgery involved operating around the vital blood vessels that attached Asree Gul\u2019s skull to the extra head.\nThree month old Asree Gul and her twin sister at a Jalalabad hospital."}
