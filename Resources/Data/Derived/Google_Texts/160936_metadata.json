That position is in direct opposition to the teachings of the Catholic Church and the guidance of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\nLast month, NCAN began circulating an online petition for support. That petition has nearly 3,300 signatures, and is supported by the multi-faith, pro-abortion, pro-\u201csexual health\u201d Religious Institute.\n\nNCAN, which claims to have \u201cover 2,000 members\u201d and says \u201ca woman cannot have full autonomy unless she has Reproductive Autonomy,\u201d also supported the Affordable Care Act (ACA). In its latest letter, the organization says it \u201cis dismayed that the Little Sisters of the Poor-Colorado, the University of Notre Dame and other Catholic organizations are challenging the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nAccording to NCAN, \u201cThese organizations are attempting to hold hostage all women by refusing insurance to them for contraceptives,\u201d and are \u201cspurred on by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.\u201d\n\nThe mandate was created under the ACA and will be in front of the Supreme Court on March 25 in lawsuits pushed by Christian owners of two businesses. The mandate forces for-profit organizations to cover contraception, abortion drugs, and sterilization procedures, and non-profits who do not want to provide this coverage are required to sign paperwork giving their insurance companies freedom to do so independently.\n\nOpponents of the mandate are calling the latter requirement an accounting gimmick, since the non-profits would still be involved in the process. According to the Alliance Defending Freedom \u2013 which represents several organizations opposing the mandate \u2013 54 injunctions have been granted against the mandate, contrasted with seven that have gone against those opposing the mandate.\n\nA spokesperson for Sisters of Life told LifeSiteNews that it \u201cremain[s] opposed to the HHS mandate because it is an affront to the dignity of women.\u201d The Sisters have long stood with the Bishops against the encroaching mandate, and the spokesperson said that the Sisters \u201cstand united with our Bishops and other people of good will in recognizing the essential primacy of upholding the freedom of conscience rights.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time NCAN has inserted itself into politically and doctrinally thorny circumstances. Its coordinator, Donna Quinn, is a Chicago nun who defied the Vatican's crackdown on dissident nuns in 2012. She has openly escorted women to get abortions, but said in 2012 that she and her fellow nuns are \u201cvery, very holy.\u201d\n\nNCAN, whose website has not been updated since 2009, saw its Board send a letter to each Member of Congress requesting the impeachment of President George Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney in 2007. The letter said both men had committed \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d among them alleged dishonesty on Iraq's possession of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nQuinn told one prominent pro-abortion author that opposing the mandate prevents freedom, because \u201cit isn\u2019t freedom when a woman can be held hostage by the owner of a business.\u201d According to the Centers for Disease Control, which surveyed over 12,000 women from 2006 to 2010, 99 percent of women who had ever engaged in sexual relations used contraception. The mandate was first proposed in 2012.\n\nSome backers of the mandate have said the USCCB and others are attempting to deny women rights, as Quinn indicates is the situation. But the mandate's opponents have been focused on the government requirement of coverage, not private negotiations over coverage between employees, employers, and insurance companies.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "title": "Dissident nuns take stand in favor of HHS abortifacient mandate", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.data.lifesitenews.com/images/news/DonnaQuinn.jpg", "url": "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/dissident-nuns-take-stand-in-favor-of-hhs-abortifacient-mandate", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 132010293551131, "pages": 112623813202}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In January, the National Coalition of American Nuns (NCAN) wrote an open letter declaring its support for the mandate, which also requires coverage of contraception and sterilization.\nIts coordinator, Donna Quinn, is a Chicago nun who defied the Vatican's crackdown on dissident nuns in 2012.\nAccording to the Alliance Defending Freedom \u2013 which represents several organizations opposing the mandate \u2013 54 injunctions have been granted against the mandate, contrasted with seven that have gone against those opposing the mandate.\nSome backers of the mandate have said the USCCB and others are attempting to deny women rights, as Quinn indicates is the situation.\nOpponents of the mandate are calling the latter requirement an accounting gimmick, since the non-profits would still be involved in the process."}
