In succeeding, Janie also discovered the horrific circumstances of her own conception.\n\nThe story spurs Jim Garlow, a pastor in California, to fight a state mandate that his church\u2019s employee health plan pay for elective abortions.\n\nWhen Janie\u2019s birth mother was a freshman in high school, two senior boys asked her to go to the movies. Instead, they took her to an open field, where they raped her. She became pregnant.\n\nHeroically, the teenage girl decided not to get an abortion but to keep the baby until birth, then give her up for adoption.\n\nIn an emotional interview with The Daily Signal, Garlow says the decision that spared his future daughter wasn\u2019t the result of her birth mother\u2019s \u201cprofound religious convictions\u201d but because \u201cshe felt like it was the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nJanie, now 37, became the first of four children whom Jim and Carol Garlow would adopt. Those children \u2014 Josie Garlow Debus, Jake Garlow, Josh Garlow and Janie Garlow McGarity \u2014 are all grown today.\n\nGarlow, 67, is senior pastor of Skyline Church in San Diego, founded in 1954 as part of the Wesleyan denomination. After the death of his first wife, he married Rosemary Schindler, an active advocate for Christians all over the world.\n\nTheir father regards the four Garlow children as the fruit of four women who made the \u201ccourageous\u201d decision to go through with their pregnancies. The most courageous of all, he says, was Janie\u2019s mother.\n\nGarlow, who in 1995 became the third senior pastor in Skyline\u2019s 60-year history, holds a doctorate in historical theology from Drew University. He received a master\u2019s degree in theology from Princeton Theological Seminary and a master of divinity from Asbury Theological Seminary.\n\nHis religious beliefs, combined with a deep gratitude for the four mothers who chose to keep their unborn children, have anchored his pro-life views.\n\nAnd then this fall, the unimaginable happened: Garlow discovered the state of California was forcing him and the staff of his church to pay for health insurance plans that cover elective abortions. They have no choice.\n\nThe state\u2019s rule, the pastor says, defies every fiber of his being:\n\nI feel that not only [that] the killing of babies in the womb is wrong foundationally, but as a father who had the privilege of adopting four children \u2026 was repulsive beyond words.\n\nGarlow didn\u2019t know how to break the news to his tight-knit congregation. After he was asked to speak at a congressional briefing Dec. 1, though, he sent an e-blast to parishioners, writing:\n\nI apologize for bringing bad news. This is shocking \u2026 and repulsive. As of last Aug. 22, our California state government (not Obamacare, this is the state) has required all insurance policies to cover elective abortions. This includes us as a church. We \u2013 along with other churches and Christian colleges \u2013 are protesting this coercive and intrusive action by filing formal protests against this abusive action. I will be speaking on this topic this week in Washington, D.C., at a special hearing at which we are strongly urging the federal government to step in immediately and pass the \u2018Abortion Non-Discrimination Act.\u2019 Pray for me as I speak. And pray for Congress to act \u2013 now.\n\nCall it ironic: Churches in California are forced to pay for abortions through employee health insurance, but under Obamacare are supposed to be exempt from paying for contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs for their employees.\n\nSince 2005, under a measure known as the Weldon Amendment, Congress has prohibited states that receive certain federal funds from discriminating against insurance plans that don\u2019t provide abortion coverage. The Hyde Amendment, first passed in 1976, prohibits using federal tax money to pay for elective abortions.\n\nSo how did this happen in California?\n\nThe state\u2019s abortion mandate didn\u2019t go through the normal legislative process, says Casey Mattox, a senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom, which champions religious liberty.\n\nMattox, who represents Garlow\u2019s Skyline Church and seven other churches in California, recalls how the issue of contraceptives was debated as part of Obamacare:\n\nLegislatures realized, \u2018We can\u2019t force churches to pay for contraceptives,\u2019 that clearly you have to exempt churches from that mandate. [State lawmakers] were able to put in appropriate exemptions to make sure at least some aspect of religious liberty was protected, but this [California] abortion mandate just went through a bureaucratic process. It\u2019s basically a sneak attack on religious liberty. It came out of nowhere.\n\nThe California Department of Managed Health Care mandated that, effective Aug. 22, almost all health insurance plans must cover elective abortions.\n\nThe rule came after the American Civil Liberties Union convinced state insurance officials that abortion is a \u201cbasic health service.\u201d Siding with the ACLU, state bureaucrats decided the agency no longer would approve health plans that don\u2019t cover the life-ending procedure.\n\n\u201cThere was no opportunity for churches to weigh in on the process,\u201d Mattox says.\n\nIn September, the lawyer filed an administrative complaint on behalf of Garlow and other California pastors with the Office of Civil Rights in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The pastors have yet to receive a response.\n\nSarah Torre, a policy analyst who follows religious liberty cases for The Heritage Foundation, says that in the current legal landscape, the decision before pastors such as Garlow is this: Continue offering health insurance covering procedures that end the life of unborn children, or drop insurance altogether.\n\n\u201cSo Pastor Garlow and others can do nothing but wait on bureaucrats in HHS to enforce the law,\u201d Torre says.\n\nChurches and other religious organizations can avoid the mandate by self-insuring, but it\u2019s a costly endeavor that could take months, even years.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t self-insure, Garlow says. \u201cWe\u2019d need years of preparation to be in that kind of posture economically.\u201d\n\nGarlow and others appealed to Congress, hoping his story would spur legislation to protect the conscience rights of individuals and churches.\n\nA total of 132 lawmakers, led by Reps. Diane Black, R-Tenn. and Rep. John Fleming, R-La., wrote Nov. 25 to Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell to express \u201cdeep concern\u201d over the California abortion mandate.\n\n\u201cForcing pastors, teachers, social service providers and Catholic institutions to pay for abortion should be unthinkable,\u201d they wrote.\n\nHHS has yet to respond to the lawmakers\u2019 request to enforce the Weldon Amendment in California.\n\nIt is clear that Burwell \u201cdoes not intend to enforce the law,\u201d Fleming told The Daily Signal.\n\nConservative lawmakers are pushing for passage of the Abortion Non-Discrimination Act, part of H.R. 940, which would allow individuals to pursue legal action to protect their religious rights.\n\nPro-life members of the House and Senate will not back down, Fleming says, but their success depends upon the support from Republican leadership, which previously blamed inaction on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.\n\nIn January, though, the Nevada Democrat will be succeeded by current Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., when Republicans claim their new nine-seat majority in the Senate as a result of the midterm elections.\n\n\u201cThat excuse is getting very weak now that we have won a majority in the Senate and we have a resounding majority in the House,\u201d Fleming says. \u201cIt\u2019s time that our GOP leadership begins to get on board.\u201d\n\nUntil then, California churches are expected to pay for a life-ending procedure that contradicts the core of their beliefs.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t fathom us participating in something so horrific and sinful,\u201d Garlow says.\n\nSadly, the pastor and his supporters believe, he already is.", "article_metadata": {"description": "She wouldn't be alive if not for her mother's courage after a rape.
