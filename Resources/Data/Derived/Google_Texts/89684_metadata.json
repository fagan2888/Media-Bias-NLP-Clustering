In addition, there is room for more vendors at the festival.\n\n\"Any community musical organizations who want to perform for about 30 to 45 minutes should contact (me) to schedule a performance,\" a release said. \"In future years, the community choirs also will be invited.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSponsored by Eric J. Richardson, DPM, of Pueblo, and Faricy Ford, of Ca\u00f1on City, the idea began when Campbell said she realized she was a member of seven bands in Southern Colorado. After she Googled the number of musicians in the area, she said she realized how much they have in common.\n\n\"I thought I'd like to get these people to meet each other,\" she said.\n\nThe Southern Colorado Community Band attended a band festival in Edgewood in 2011. However, when the organizer died, the festivals were discontinued.\n\nBut Campbell did not want it to disband so she contacted the association and slowly began organizing the event again.\n\n\"I finally took the plunge,\" she said.\n\nCampbell said minors who want to participate should have permission slips from their parents or guardians.\n\nThe event is free for audiences. Vendor table fees are $25. Unaffiliated musicians who wish to play in the concert will pay a $10 fee. If more than five people wish to play as a group, the fee is capped at $50, a release said.\n\nFor more information, call Campbell at 561-0648 or visit http://SCCMF.org\">SCCMF.org.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_25878102/southern-colorado-community-music-festival-set-saturday", "sailthru.section": "Canon City Breaking News, Sports, Weather, Traffic", "sailthru.author": "By Charlotte Burrous \n \n  burrousc@canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "Florence \u2014 The inaugural Southern Colorado Community Music Festival will be from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:25878102:view"}, "startDate": "2014-06-01T20:49:05-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_25878102/southern-colorado-community-music-festival-set-saturday", "image": "http://local.canoncitydailyrecord.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/canoncitydailyrecord.png", "type": "article", "description": "Florence \u2014 The inaugural Southern Colorado Community Music Festival will be from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.", "title": "Southern Colorado Community Music Festival set for Saturday"}, "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "Florence \u2014 The inaugural Southern Colorado Community Music Festival will be from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.", "title": "Southern Colorado Community Music Festival set for Saturday", "url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_25878102/southern-colorado-community-music-festival-set-saturday", "image": "http://local.canoncitydailyrecord.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/canoncitydailyrecord.png", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-06-01T20:49:05-0600", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "Southern Colorado Community Music Festival set for Saturday", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "By Charlotte Burrousburrousc@canoncitydailyrecord.com", "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "modificationDate": "2014-06-01T20:49:48-0600", "endDate": "2024-06-01T19:32:20-0600", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "pubDate": "2014-06-01T20:50:10-0600", "news_keywords": "Canon City news, Colorado news, world news, national news, local news, business news, sports news, entertainment news, us news, Canon City Daily Record"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd07a5\"", "article_summary": "The four bands are Southern Colorado Community Band of Ca\u00f1on City, Pueblo West Community Band, La Junta Smile Hi Band and Sangre de Cristo Community Band of Westcliffe.\nThe Southern Colorado Community Band attended a band festival in Edgewood in 2011.\nFlorence \u2014 The inaugural Southern Colorado Community Music Festival will be from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday at Florence High School, 2006 Colo. 67.\n\"We're also encouraging musicians who are not affiliated with community bands to come because at the end of the day, we're having an impromptu concert,\" Campbell said.\n\"We're going to have four community bands represented,\" said organizer Sharon Campbell."}
