Hillary Clinton made her point on abortion clearly known on NBC’s “Meet the Press” Sunday morning. The Democratic frontrunner responded to Chuck Todd's question on whether or not an unborn child has constitutional rights by saying, "The unborn person doesn’t have constitutional rights."

"When or if does an unborn child have constitutional rights?" Todd asked.

"Well, under our laws currently, that is not something that exists. The unborn person doesn’t have constitutional rights. Now, that doesn’t mean that we don’t do everything we possibly can in the vast majority of instances to, you know, help a mother who is carrying a child and wants to make sure that child will be healthy, to have appropriate medical support. It doesn’t mean that, you know, don’t do everything possible to try to fulfill your obligations. But it does not include sacrificing the woman’s right to make decisions. And I think that’s an important distinction that under Roe v. Wade we’ve had refined under our Constitution," Clinton said.
