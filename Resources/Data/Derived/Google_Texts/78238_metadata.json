Blatstein attorneys notified the county court by email late Friday and said they would file a formal notice of removal on Monday.\n\nBlatstein, the noted reviver of Northern Liberties who has a summer home in Margate, wants to inject life into the failing luxury mall with entertainment and other kinds of venues. He paid $2.7 million to assume control over the lease from the Pier's prior operator, but Caesars now says that as owner of the Pier itself, they have the right to approve or disapprove of that transaction.\n\nBlatstein says the casino company - which has been the subject of criticism from tenants of the Pier Shops, as well as former employees of Showboat, which they closed - was on board until Blatstein dropped off his blueprints. He accused Ortzman of wanting to steal his ideas for the Pier for themselves.", "article_metadata": {"pubdate": 20160526, "editdate": "20150302T07:26:02", "twitter": {"title": "UPDATE: Blatstein files to move Caesars case to U.S. bankruptcy court", "url": "http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/downashore/Blatstein-seeks-to-move-Caesars-case-to-bankruptcy-court.html", "image": "http://media.philly.com/images/20150223-Atlantic-City-Pier.jpg", "creator": "@amysrosenberg", "site": "@phillydotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "cg": "news", "keywords": "Amy S.
