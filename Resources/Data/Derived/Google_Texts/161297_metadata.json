Unsurprisingly, the government shutdown and debt ceiling negotiations came up more than once. Norquist has already expressed his disdain for the Tea Party\u2019s \u201cdefund Obamacare\u201d strategy, led by Texas Senator Ted Cruz, whom Norquist has said \"crashed and burned\" and dragged Republicans \"across broken glass for no purpose.\"\n\nToday, he attacked Cruz with analogies. Here were the three best:\n\n1. \u201cCruz looked up this summer and said, \u2018They\u2019re going to give us a bunch of stuff in order to do the debt ceiling! What will we ask for? I\u2019ll jump out with the biggest ask, demanding that that\u2019s the only thing to ask for.\u2019 [Paul Ryan] has put the work in. This is the wind and the lion. The wind blows by, but the lion is still there. Cruz comes in, sells everybody on 76 trombones, and people buy in temporarily.\u201d\n\n2. \u201cI was a supporter of [asking to delay Obamacare rather than defunding it]. I thought we should\u2019ve opened with delay. And we\u2019d be very accordion-like on how much of a delay would be a win, and I thought the president could actually accept some delay and you\u2019d have some progress. It\u2019s this idea that if you\u2019re going to come in and say, \u2018I\u2019d like your kidney,\u2019 you might have a chance of a negotiation. If you ask for a liver, the answer\u2019s probably no. So by asking for too much, they just kicked it away.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Grover Norquist, founder and president of Americans for Tax Reform, came to the offices of The New Republic Thursday for a wide-ranging discussion on American politics and the future of the Republican Party.
