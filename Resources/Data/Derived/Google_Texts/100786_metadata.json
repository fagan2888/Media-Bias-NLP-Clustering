The Chiefs lost defensive tackle Mike DeVito for the season with a ruptured Achilles tendon in Sunday\u2019s 26-10 loss to Tennessee.\n\nThe 31-year-old Vickerson spent the past four seasons in Denver, where the Chiefs visit on Sunday, and was waived just prior to the season. He played well two years ago, making 40 tackles and a pair of sacks, but seemed to regress a bit last season. He began his career in Tennessee and has made 153 tackles and 6 1/2 sacks over seven seasons.\n\nJaye Howard took the majority of snaps after DeVito left the game. Vance Walker will also have a chance to earn playing time after signing as a free agent in the offseason.\n\n\u201cHoward is an explosive player. His big thing was just making sure that was something that took place on every play,\u201d coach Andy Reid said. \u201cConsistency was the factor. He\u2019s shown us that he can do that throughout his time here. He had a good preseason with us and now will have an opportunity to get in there and play a little bit more.\u201d\n\nThe Chiefs are also looking for a linebacker after losing Derrick Johnson to his own ruptured Achilles tendon, working out several potential replacements early this week. Joe Mays, who was signed in the offseason, is on injured reserve following surgery to repair a broken wrist. He carries the designation to return, but that\u2019s unlikely for a while.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll keep our eyes open to fill those spots,\u201d Reid said. \u201cWe\u2019ll look at our practice squad players, we\u2019ll also look in the free agent area and also any other option that\u2019s available.\u201d\n\nJames-Michael Johnson and Josh Mauga are the next in line at middle linebacker.\n\n\u201cWe thought JMJ was a good, solid linebacker. We felt that he was \u2014 at least from what he had shown \u2014 had been better in the sub-group, so that\u2019s where we used him a little bit last year and we had started using him in that position this year,\u201d Reid said. \u201cBut we do feel like he can step up and if he needs to play more, then he\u2019ll play more.\u201d\n\nMauga has knowledge of coordinator Bob Sutton\u2019s defense from his time with the Jets.\n\n\u201cOverall a good football player,\u201d Reid said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we brought him, to give him that opportunity to play, at that time backup, and now he\u2019s asked to start.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "AP source: Chiefs sign former Broncos DT Kevin Vickerson", "title": "AP source: Chiefs sign former Broncos DT Kevin Vickerson", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/09/ap-source-chiefs-sign-former-broncos-dt-kevin-vickerson/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20140902__kevin-vickerson-broncos-090214p1.jpg", "height": 417}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20140902__kevin-vickerson-broncos-090214p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-09T12:54:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-21T21:20:39+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe01e1\"", "article_summary": "The 31-year-old Vickerson spent the past four seasons in Denver, where the Chiefs visit on Sunday, and was waived just prior to the season.\n\u2014 The Kansas City Chiefs began reworking their injury-depleted defense Tuesday by signing former Denver Broncos defensive tackle Kevin Vickerson to a one-year contract, a person with knowledge of the deal told The Associated Press.\nThe Chiefs lost defensive tackle Mike DeVito for the season with a ruptured Achilles tendon in Sunday\u2019s 26-10 loss to Tennessee.\nHe played well two years ago, making 40 tackles and a pair of sacks, but seemed to regress a bit last season.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we brought him, to give him that opportunity to play, at that time backup, and now he\u2019s asked to start.\u201d"}
