She's a student mentor who helps the sixth-graders through the school's 360 leadership program. She's kind to others and a great friend. She's someone kids can trust. She's a great leader.\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to about eighth-grade?\n\nWe have more freedom in the school. We know how to get around and we have more connections. We're competent.\n\nWhy did you want to be a mentor to younger students?\n\nI get to look after younger students and help them out. I want to be a good role model and build leadership skills.\n\nWhat advice would you give sixth-graders?\n\nReally be yourself. Middle school is a good place to express yourself and figure out who you are. Be open to making new friends and be flexible.\n\nWhat should they not do?\n\nDon't do something that you know is wrong or that you're uncomfortable with.\n\nWhat do you like about Manhattan?\n\nThere are good teachers here. I'm not doing it, but the school has an arts focus. They're setting up kids for what they want to do later in life. They can build on their talents.\n\nWhat would you change?\n\nFor kids who don't focus on the arts, they could have more elective options.\n\nWhat's your favorite subject?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI really like Spanish and math.\n\nWhat makes a good teacher?\n\nHumor and friendliness. Having your own opinions, but letting students have their own opinions, too.\n\nWhat do you like to do outside school?\n\nI play soccer for FC Boulder. I started playing soccer when I was really little. It's my passion and what I'm good at.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_28687701/student-spotlight-sunny-pine-13-year-old-eighth", "modificationDate": "2015-08-22T22:33:15-0600", "sailthru.section": "Boulder Education & Schools", "endDate": "2025-08-22T21:33:10-0600", "description": "Sunny Pine, 13-year-old eighth-grader at Boulder's Manhattan Middle School\n\n\n\nSunny exemplifies a great Manhattan student.", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28687701:view"}, "startDate": "2015-08-22T22:32:13-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_28687701/student-spotlight-sunny-pine-13-year-old-eighth", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Sunny Pine, 13-year-old eighth-grader at Boulder's Manhattan Middle School\n\n\n\nSunny exemplifies a great Manhattan student.", "title": "Student Spotlight: Sunny Pine, 13-year-old eighth-grader at Boulder's Manhattan Middle School"}, "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Sunny Pine, 13-year-old eighth-grader at Boulder's Manhattan Middle School\n\n\n\nSunny exemplifies a great Manhattan student.", "title": "Student Spotlight: Sunny Pine, 13-year-old eighth-grader at Boulder's Manhattan Middle School", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_28687701/student-spotlight-sunny-pine-13-year-old-eighth", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-08-22T22:32:13-0600", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "sailthru.title": "Student Spotlight: Sunny Pine, 13-year-old eighth-grader at Boulder's Manhattan Middle School", "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0822/20150822__23DCASPO~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-08-22T22:34:05-0600", "news_keywords": "news information  boulder county schools elementary middle high preps"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb516\"", "article_summary": "Click photo to enlarge \u00ab1\u00bbSunny Pine, 13-year-old eighth-grader at Boulder's Manhattan Middle SchoolSunny exemplifies a great Manhattan student.\nWhy did you want to be a mentor to younger students?\nI get to look after younger students and help them out.\nShe's a student mentor who helps the sixth-graders through the school's 360 leadership program.\nMiddle school is a good place to express yourself and figure out who you are."}
