That can make their situation worse.\n\nA group in San Diego has made it their mission to encourage young adults with mental illness to get out of their shell, make friends and have a good time.\n\nThe group is operated by young people.\n\nOn a recent Sunday afternoon at the downtown branch of the San Diego library, the group called Impact Young Adults celebrated its 10th anniversary.\n\n\u201c\u2019Impact Young Adults,\u2019 10 years in the making,\u201d Ellen Frudakis told the audience. \u201cToday, San Diego. Tomorrow, world domination!\u201d\n\nThe crowd laughed and applauded.\n\nThe Genesis\n\nTen years ago, Frudakis and Johanna Baker were both struggling with mental illnesses. Frudakis was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when she was 20.\n\nShe spent a lot of time grappling with it behind closed doors.\n\n\u201cBut I really needed to be able to connect with other people like myself, to remind me that I was bigger and more than the diagnosis,\u201d Frudakis recalled.\n\nBaker was knocked down by major depression. She lost her career as a music teacher and her social circle.\n\n\u201cSo I needed people in my life, where I would feel accepted and feel like I belonged,\u201d Baker said.\n\nBaker and Frudakis felt that life had to be more than visits to the psychiatrist and sitting at home alone. They wanted to have fun with people their own age.\n\nBeginning in 2005, they formed their own social group and organized weekly social events such as rock climbing, ice skating and going out to the movies.\n\nIn its 10 years of operation, Impact Young Adults has hosted more than 500 get-togethers and community events.\n\nThere are other social programs run by mental health agencies, but Impact is the only one in California run by young adults.\n\nImpact currently has 60 members in San Diego. Members must be between 18 and 35, have a mental illness and be involved in some form of treatment or other effort to improve their health.\n\n\u2018Impact\u2019 Has Big Impact\n\nWhen he was in college on the East Coast in 2009, Mike Robertson\u2019s life was derailed by schizophrenia. He started treatment in San Diego and heard about Impact.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to find people like me, when not in the hospital, you know,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cAnd then finding Impact was just great, I really fit in with everybody.\u201d\n\nRobertson has to take some pretty heavy medication to control his condition. It helps him lead a normal life. He considers Impact to be just as important.\n\n\u201cI love sharing my passions with other people,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cI love getting to share fishing, surfing with people, and it just makes me feel good.\u201d\n\nFeeling Good\n\nBaker says helping members feel good is one of Impact\u2019s goals.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t deny that mental illness can be debilitating and tough to manage, but Baker contends it doesn\u2019t have to be someone\u2019s defining characteristic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a piece of who you are,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not meant to be this limitation that prevents you from doing all the things you might ever have wanted to do.\u201d\n\nFrudakis is proud of what Impact has done in its first 10 years. She\u2019d like to see groups like it spring up in other parts of the country.\n\nFrudakis said that when you have a mental illness, one thing\u2019s for sure: being isolated is the worst thing of all.\n\n\u201cWhen you stay isolated, you don\u2019t find resources, you don\u2019t find a way out,\u201d Frudakis said. \u201cAnd so, I would love for more young people across the country to be able to find what we\u2019ve found, and have the joy and the experience with their peers that we\u2019ve been able to have.\u201d\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census, there are more than 63 million Americans ages 18 to 34. Based on National Institute of Mental Health estimates, that means more than 12 million young adults in the U.S. have a diagnosable mental illness. The numbers alone show there is definitely a need for more programs like Impact.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In its 10-year history \"Impact Young Adults\" has run 500 social events specifically for young adults with mental illness.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"San Diego Group Has Fun 'Impact' on Young Adults with Mental Illness\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/11\\/18\\/san-diego-group-has-fun-impact-on-young-adults-with-mental-illness\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-11-18 11:39:17\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-11-18 17:28:01\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":22564,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Mental Health\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Living Healthy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/11\\/impact1.png\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "In its 10-year history \"Impact Young Adults\" has run 500 social events specifically for young adults with mental illness.", "title": "San Diego Group Has Fun \u2018Impact\u2019 on Young Adults with Mental Illness", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/11/18/san-diego-group-has-fun-impact-on-young-adults-with-mental-illness/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/11/impact1-640x353.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "mental health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "On a recent Sunday afternoon at the downtown branch of the San Diego library, the group called Impact Young Adults celebrated its 10th anniversary.\nBy Kenny Goldberg, KPBSThe National Institute of Mental Health says about one in five young adults has a diagnosable mental illness.\nBased on National Institute of Mental Health estimates, that means more than 12 million young adults in the U.S. have a diagnosable mental illness.\nIn its 10 years of operation, Impact Young Adults has hosted more than 500 get-togethers and community events.\nA group in San Diego has made it their mission to encourage young adults with mental illness to get out of their shell, make friends and have a good time."}
