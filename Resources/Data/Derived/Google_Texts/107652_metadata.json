Who knew that?\n\nWho but the people who lived in the city during Sharpton's reign of terror, who remember innocent men murdered in Crown Heights and at Freddy's because Obama's new best friend and Bill de Blasio's unofficial Chief of Staff was trying to get rich and famous.\n\nNow two cops are dead and the former commissioner is putting the blame exactly where it belongs.\n\nFormer New York City Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik told Newsmax that Saturday's execution-style shooting of two uniformed police officers was ultimately encouraged by Mayor Bill De Blasio and the Rev. Al Sharpton \u2014 and \"they have blood on their hands.\" \"De Blasio, Sharpton and all those who encouraged this anti-cop, racist mentality all have blood on their hands,\" he said. \"They have blood on their hands.\" \"This guy's intent \u2014 based on that Instagram post \u2014 was retribution for Eric Garner and Michael Brown,\" he told Newsmax. \"The people who encouraged these protests \u2014 you had peaceful protesters who were screaming 'kill the cops' \u2014 the so-called peaceful protesters. \"Who was encouraging these protesters? De Blasio, Sharpton and other elected officials and community leaders. They encouraged this mentality. They encouraged this behavior. \"They encouraged it \u2014 and these two cops are dead because of people like them,\" Kerik said. \"They don't owe the cops an apology. \"An apology isn't good enough. They have blood on their hands.\"\n\nI would add to that all the fake conservatives who cheered on the Garner mob on Twitter and in articles. I spoke out against these people from Day 1, most of whom have don't live in urban area and have absolutely no clue of the real dynamics of a situation like this.\n\nI don't expect Sharpton or De Blasio to examine their consciences. They don't have them. But it would be nice if some of the people on the right who jumped on the Garner case without having Clue 1 about it would consider the role they played in blowing it up.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "\"They encouraged it \u2014 and these two cops are dead because of people like them,\"", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "\"They encouraged it \u2014 and these two cops are dead because of people like them,\"", "title": "Ex-NYPD Commish: \"De Blasio, Sharpton, etc Have Blood on Their Hands\"", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/247838/ex-nypd-commish-de-blasio-sharpton-etc-have-blood-daniel-greenfield", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:42:41-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/247838/ex-nypd-commish-de-blasio-sharpton-etc-have-blood-daniel-greenfield", "description": "\"They encouraged it \u2014 and these two cops are dead because of people like them,\"", "card": "summary", "title": "Ex-NYPD Commish: \"De Blasio, Sharpton, etc Have Blood on Their Hands\""}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-20T15:37:56-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:42:41-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd243d\"", "article_summary": "\"De Blasio, Sharpton and all those who encouraged this anti-cop, racist mentality all have blood on their hands,\" he said.\nDe Blasio, Sharpton and other elected officials and community leaders.\nAl Sharpton \u2014 and \"they have blood on their hands.\"\nI don't expect Sharpton or De Blasio to examine their consciences.\n\"The people who encouraged these protests \u2014 you had peaceful protesters who were screaming 'kill the cops' \u2014 the so-called peaceful protesters."}
