It is the largest outbreak in the state\u2019s history.\n\nThe outbreak is believed to have spread by drug users in rural southern Indiana sharing needles.\n\nThe number of new HIV diagnoses in Iowa dropped 19 percent from 2013 to 2014. But Randy Mayer, the state\u2019s HIV/AIDS/STD bureau chief, cautioned that number could rebound slightly next year while continuing a general downward trend.\n\nMayer also said the state is on full alert for breakouts such as Indiana\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a possibility for something like that in any state that has any rural community with large injection drug use,\u201d Mayer said.\n\nDrops and Shake-ups\n\nIn 2013, there were 122 new HIV diagnoses in Iowa. That fell in 2014 to 99, the lowest in at least a decade.\n\nMayer believes there is a gradual trend of fewer new diagnoses in Iowa each year, but he suspects the drop between 2013 and 2014 will prove to be abnormally large.\n\nThere was a similarly steep drop from 2007 to 2008, but Mayer said that was due to a significant percentage of the population not getting tested due to the floods in Cedar Rapids.\n\nMayer was not sure how to explain the dramatic drop in new diagnoses in 2014. He said one possibility is the shake-up of medical care under the new federal health care law.\n\n\u201cIn 2014 you had the Affordable Care Act implemented at its peak, so you have to wonder, might there have been some influence with people changing medical providers \u2026 or medical providers not testing,\u201d Mayer said.\n\nMayer believes it is likely the number of HIV diagnoses will increase from 2014 to 2015, but remain on an overall downward trend. He noted the long-term trend has shown fewer diagnoses since peaking at more than 120 in 2009.\n\n\u201cWe saw a (near) 20 percent decrease in diagnoses (in 2014). That\u2019s way too much. We\u2019re already seeing some evidence it will come back up closer to where it was,\u201d Mayer said.\n\n\u201cI expect them to come up, but hopefully not as high as in the past.\u201d\n\nSharing Needles\n\nThe hardest-hit area by the HIV outbreak in Indiana was Scott County, near the state\u2019s southern border, just 40 miles north of Louisville, Ky.\n\nThe area previously had never reported more than five HIV cases in a single year.\n\nThe culprit: drug users sharing needles.\n\nMayer said there are known pockets of injection drug users in Iowa, and his department closely is monitoring those areas for warnings signs of a similar outbreak here.\n\n\u201cWe have some anecdotal evidence of drug use and increased positive (testing) for hepatitis C in parts of the state,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve been hearing from substance abuse treatment providers that they\u2019ve seen an increase in the use of heroin and other opiate drugs.\u201d\n\nMayer said whenever an injection drug user is diagnosed with hepatitis C \u2014 which can be transmitted similarly to and sometimes at the same time as HIV \u2014 \u201cmy staff\u2019s alarm bells go off we monitor the situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cHopefully we have the services provided and we are being vigilant so we would be able to contain an epidemic that could start among that population,\u201d Mayer added.\n\nVigilance could help stem an outbreak before it gets started, he said.\n\n\u201cEspecially with injection drug users, just watching that population closely. When we get one injection drug user gets diagnosed, getting to them quickly, making sure (he or she) gets tested, making sure we get all the (sexual) partners tested,\u201d Mayer said.\n\nIf Iowa can avoid an outbreak similar to what happened in Indiana, Mayer hopes the state will continue on that downward trend of new diagnoses. He said the federal government\u2019s analysis suggests Iowa has passed its \u201ctipping point\u201d of new diagnoses, and that those numbers should continue to drop over the long-term.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been containing things. We\u2019ve been expecting or hoping we\u2019d see some decreases in diagnoses,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cI think we\u2019re actually there.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | DES MOINES - An outbreak of HIV cases in rural Indiana delivers a dire warning to states with similar rural pockets, such as Iowa, even as the number of newly d", "og": {"site_name": "The Gazette", "description": "DES MOINES - An outbreak of HIV cases in rural Indiana delivers a dire warning to states with similar rural pockets, such as Iowa, even as the number of newly diagnosed Iowans fell sharply last year.", "url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/health/state-on-alert-after-hiv-outbreak-in-indiana-20150706", "image": "http://www.thegazette.com/storyimage/GA/20150706/ARTICLE/150709824/AR/0/AR-150709824.jpg", "article": {"section": "Default"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/health/state-on-alert-after-hiv-outbreak-in-indiana-20150706", "description": "DES MOINES - An outbreak of HIV cases in rural Indiana delivers a dire warning to states with similar rural pockets, such as Iowa, even as the number of newly diagnosed Iowans fell sharply last year.", "site": "@gazettedotcom", "title": "State on alert after HIV outbreak in Indiana"}, "fb": {"app_id": 163646090334606}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "bt": {"modDate": "2015-07-05T23:54:00-05:00", "type": "thegazette_default", "pubDate": "2015-07-06T02:00:00-05:00", "title": "State on alert after HIV outbreak in Indiana"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-touch-fullscreen": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "The outbreak is believed to have spread by drug users in rural southern Indiana sharing needles.\nIf Iowa can avoid an outbreak similar to what happened in Indiana, Mayer hopes the state will continue on that downward trend of new diagnoses.\nThe number of new HIV diagnoses in Iowa dropped 19 percent from 2013 to 2014.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a possibility for something like that in any state that has any rural community with large injection drug use,\u201d Mayer said.\nDrops and Shake-upsIn 2013, there were 122 new HIV diagnoses in Iowa."}
