Marvin Austin took a red-eye flight to North Carolina on Sunday night after his father was involved in a serious car accident.

The Broncos excused the defensive tackle and will provide any support he needs during this crisis.

“It’s something where you need to go home and be with your family,” said defensive lineman Malik Jackson, who lost his father to illness two weeks ago. “All we can do is send our prayers out for him, letting him know we are thinking about him. That’s all we can do.”

According to ABC Channel 11 in North Carolina, Marvin Austin Sr., 49, was ejected from his car around 6:30 p.m. EST near Live Oak Church Road in Selma, N.C. All four occupants in the car were hospitalized, with Austin suffering the most serious injuries.

According to Channel 11, all four passengers are at Wake Medical Center in Raleigh. The Highway Patrol said charges are pending in the accident.

The Broncos signed Austin in May. He turned into one of the surprise stories of training camp, making the team with strong play throughout the preseason. He credited his career rebound to back surgery which returned his explosiveness. A former second-round draft choice of the Giants, Austin has played 32 snaps in the first two games as a reserve.
