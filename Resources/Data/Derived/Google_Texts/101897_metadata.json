Except for the yellow buses out front, there are no visible signs this building houses a private school instead of a tech company.\n\nNow at the end of its first academic year, BASIS Independent Silicon Valley is a self-labeled \u201cSTEM-focused liberal arts program,\u201d part of an educational startup called BASIS.ed, which manages a system of nationally ranked charter and private schools across the United States.\n\nA science and math focus in middle and high school is particularly important to families in Silicon Valley, where many parents work in STEM fields and want their children receiving the best possible instruction.\u201cWe hope to continue to be that draw for parents that want a STEM education, that want their children to really excel in these areas,\u201d said math teacher Han Lee.BASIS schools promise middle and high school students academic rigor surpassing other top school systems around the world, providing \u201can environment where students are not underestimated,\u201d said Toby Walker, head of school at BASIS Silicon Valley.They share an advanced curriculum which involves taking biology, chemistry and physics from sixth to eighth grade (three hours per week, per class), the option to take AP World History in eighth grade and a math program that places students by ability. This year, BASIS Silicon Valley has one fourth grader taking Algebra 2.\n\nThe number of Advanced Placement classes required to graduate BASIS is six, but according to Director of Student Enrollment Vanissa Hernandez, the average BASIS student takes 10 to 12.\n\nResults from the school are still forthcoming, as the first twelfth-grade class of BASIS Silicon Valley students will graduate next year, but the school is already drawing interest from families that attend local private schools.Ananta Iyengar, a current BASIS parent, first learned about BASIS in summer 2014 from a news article. Iyengar was attracted to the school based on national rankings and BASIS schools\u2019 performance on the Programme for International Student Assessment, known as PISA. His daughter just wrapped up eighth grade there after transferring from the private school, Challenger, in San Jose.PISA tests over half a billion students in more than 70 countries in reading, math and science. Countries such as Singapore, South Korea and Germany regularly outperform American students in these categories, but according to a promotional video on BASIS Silicon Valley\u2019s website, BASIS students outperform average students from the highest-ranking region \u2014 Shanghai, China.Another major draw for parents is the middle school curriculum of teaching biology, chemistry and physics simultaneously. In that educational model, which is followed by many other nations in Europe and Asia, \u201cyou don\u2019t do physics one year and it\u2019s another four years before you do physics again,\u201d said Jonathan Osborne, Stanford\u2019s Kamalachari Professor of Science Education and PISA science framework director.And typically, American high school science courses do not expect prior subject knowledge from middle school. According to Osborne, \u201cThe content doesn\u2019t seem to build on what\u2019s happened before. Everyone seems to restart from scratch, which is stupid.\u201dIn biology class on a recent Thursday, four students grappled with the details of genetic transcription, or the way DNA is copied into RNA. Three of the students sat on tables and a couple took pictures of the board on their cell phones as a study tool.\n\nAnuradha Murthy, the teacher, compared the way nucleotides cluster to a DNA template to the way fans gather around Bollywood celebrity Salman Khan. Three of the four students got the reference.\n\nHernandez and Walker attribute BASIS\u2019s success to their teachers \u2014 and the school has certainly had their pick of talent. According to Hernandez, BASIS Silicon Valley received 95 applications per teaching position, and there are 13 PhDs on the faculty.Lee said that BASIS Silicon Valley teacher salaries are comparable to those of public school teachers. He was attracted to BASIS because of the school\u2019s academic approach: \u201cThese students are really driven and they want to succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe administration really focuses on supporting students and teachers in their endeavors.\u201dBeing located in Silicon Valley has \u201cless tangible\u201d effects on BASIS education too, according to Walker. \u201cThe environment feeds tech innovation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s right here on our doorstep, and it really feeds and fuels the imagination of the young people in the building.\u201dThis fall, BASIS Silicon Valley will grow from 575 students to a full capacity of 800. According to Walker, signs are good that BASIS Silicon Valley will live up to the reputation of its forerunners such as BASIS Scottsdale, currently ranked second in U.S. News and World Report\u2019s \u201cBest High Schools.\u201d All BASIS schools take an annual evaluation test for internal use, and Walker said BASIS Silicon Valley students are already outperforming Scottsdale in a number of areas on that test.Tuition near year will be $23,750. Unlike other private schools in the area, BASIS Silicon Valley does not currently offer financial aid.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s still in the mid-range in terms of private school tuition \u2014 more expensive than Stratford and Challenger, but less expensive than Harker.\n\nThe school does not collect demographic data of their student body, but Hernandez said the student body is heavily South Asian and Asian.BASIS Silicon Valley does not pretend that their environment works for all families. \u201cWe\u2019re never going to be the school known for our athletic program,\u201d said Walker, noting that families come to BASIS for its academics.Physical education and arts classes become electives after seventh grade, but students do take a range of humanities classes including two years of Latin in middle school and AP English, U.S. Government and World History in high school.There\u2019s no playground \u2014 just a small grassy area where students eat lunch \u2014 and an outdoor basketball half-court. There\u2019s a full indoor basketball court where gym class is taught. Opportunities are available, with an extra fee, for students to pursue extracurricular athletics like cricket and squash off-campus.But even families who prioritize STEM education are not necessarily choosing BASIS. Entrepreneur and software engineer Ramesh Srinivasan\u2019s daughter was admitted to BASIS Silicon Valley, but the family chose the local public high school instead. He felt he and his wife would be able to help their daughter achieve at the same level as BASIS students.Research on the effect of role models on student performance agrees with Srinivasan.\u201cOne of the biggest influences on whether people go on with STEM or not is whether they have a parent or know somebody who is engaged in STEM,\u201d Osborne said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "Now at the end of its first academic year, BASIS Independent Silicon Valley is providing a science and math focus for middle and high school students in a region where many parents work in STEM fields.", "title": "New science and math school fills Silicon Valley demand for better STEM Education - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P1010605_b.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-17T09:57:24+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2015/06/11/basis-independent-silicon-valley/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Education", "tag": "STEM", "published_time": "2015-06-11T10:21:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-17T09:57:24+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Now at the end of its first academic year, BASIS Independent Silicon Valley is providing a science and math focus for middle and high school students in a region where many parents work in STEM fields.", "creator": "@PeninsuPress", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P1010605_b.jpg", "title": "New science and math school fills Silicon Valley demand for better STEM Education - Peninsula Press", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1a14\"", "article_summary": "According to Hernandez, BASIS Silicon Valley received 95 applications per teaching position, and there are 13 PhDs on the faculty.Lee said that BASIS Silicon Valley teacher salaries are comparable to those of public school teachers.\nThis year, BASIS Silicon Valley has one fourth grader taking Algebra 2.\nEntrepreneur and software engineer Ramesh Srinivasan\u2019s daughter was admitted to BASIS Silicon Valley, but the family chose the local public high school instead.\nUnlike other private schools in the area, BASIS Silicon Valley does not currently offer financial aid.\nExcept for the yellow buses out front, there are no visible signs this building houses a private school instead of a tech company."}
