Especially children who are A) dead, or B) suffering from a disorder.\n\nSuch is the case with \u201cRyan\u2019s Law,\u201d a 2007 autism bill which mandated state insurance companies provide up to $50,000 a year of coverage for behavioral therapy for children under the age of sixteen.\n\nThis mandate was correctly vetoed by former S.C. governor Mark Sanford (back when he used to be a principled taxpayer advocate) \u2013 but Sanford\u2019s veto was unanimously overridden by both the House and Senate.\n\nNow, liberal State Senator Ray Cleary \u2013 one of the biggest tax-and-spenders in the S.C. General Assembly \u2013 is proposing amendments to Ryan\u2019s Law which would usher in a major expansion of Barack Obama\u2018s socialized medicine law in South Carolina. And cost Palmetto State taxpayers \u201cuntold millions\u201d of dollars.\n\nDoes that sound like something our dirt poor population can afford? Especially given the rampant socialized medicine growth our state\u2019s \u201cRepublican\u201d leaders are imposing?\n\nHell no \u2026\n\nCleary\u2019s proposal wipes out existing eligibility requirements for Ryan\u2019s Law, opening the door to a flood of new applicants \u2013 and new costs. And yes, because this would be a \u201cnew benefit\u201d enacted after 2011, Obamacare requires the state to defray every penny of the new mandates for those who sign up for coverage on the federal \u201cexchanges.\u201d\n\n(Even though these exchanges may or may not be legal in the first place).\n\nHow big a tab are we talking about here? At least $5 million a year, according to one industry expert we spoke with \u2013 although they acknowledged this was a \u201cconservative\u201d estimate.\n\nThe truth is they don\u2019t know how expensive it\u2019s going to be \u2026 on taxpayers or South Carolina insurance customers.\n\n\u201cIt is an unknown, open-ended, recurring obligation exposing taxpayers to untold millions in fiscal liability,\u201d the source explained.\n\nAgain \u2026 absent any attempt to seek possible matching federal funds first.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re leaving millions of federal dollars on the table,\u201d one lobbyist familiar with the plan told FITS. \u201cThis is a new mandated benefit for policies purchased on the federal health care exchange \u2013 paid for 100 percent by the state.\u201d\n\nLorri Shealy Unumb \u2013 the Ryan\u2019s law architect who is pushing the current expansion \u2013 acknowledges there will be a cost to the state. Of course she claims the fiscal impact will be much smaller \u2013 roughly $530,000.\n\nWhere\u2019s she pulling those numbers from? We\u2019re not sure \u2026 but we\u2019re guessing it\u2019s someplace that doesn\u2019t get a lot of sunlight.\n\nAnyway, State Senators voted in favor of the bill last month \u2013 overwhelmingly \u2013 but they did so without a proper accounting of the cost.\n\nUnumb, of interest, is the vice president at the Autism Academy of South Carolina \u2013 which charges between $1,800 \u2013 $4,500 a month per child to provide behavioral therapy for children between the ages of two and twenty-one. Of course those are the academy\u2019s \u201cprivate pay rates.\u201d Insured clients pay bigger tabs (because they are \u201ccovered\u201d), and by forcing an expansion of the insured population it will increase the percentage of clients paying the higher rates.\n\nMedicaid recipients? Please \u2026 they don\u2019t take those kids because the reimbursement rates are too low.\n\nAh, \u201cnon-profits.\u201d\n\nOh, and speaking of \u2026 Unumb draws a $125,000-a-year salary from this particular entity, which is more than three times the state\u2019s median household income last time we checked.\n\nLook \u2026 we get it.\n\nKids with autism aren\u2019t easy for a lot of parents to deal with \u2013 and finding a place for them to spend the majority of their waking hours is a costly proposition. But is that really sufficient justification for passing a multi-million dollar tab onto already overburdened South Carolina taxpayers?\n\nWe think not \u2026", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.fitsnews.com/2015/05/05/ryans-law-expansion-growing-obamacare-in-sc/", "site_name": "http://www.fitsnews.com", "image": "http://fitsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/state-house-555x370.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "\u201cRyan\u2019s Law\u201d Expansion: Growing Obamacare In SC"}, "google-site-verification": "qt01SY7jA5pURQJ_8ITASviDysHU8yHfJWpIIdAPKQU", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce02c\"", "article_summary": "Hell no \u2026Cleary\u2019s proposal wipes out existing eligibility requirements for Ryan\u2019s Law, opening the door to a flood of new applicants \u2013 and new costs.\nBut is that really sufficient justification for passing a multi-million dollar tab onto already overburdened South Carolina taxpayers?\nNow, liberal State Senator Ray Cleary \u2013 one of the biggest tax-and-spenders in the S.C.
