The monumental feat of endurance \u2014 100 miles up and down 90,000 vertical feet in a scant 60 hours \u2014 had only been completed by seven men since 1999, until this year.\n\nIn the past six weeks, at least 18 endurance athletes \u2014 including three women \u2014 attempted the largely trail-less trek across the top of the Sawatch Range, marking the most activity ever on the underground race route. Four of those runners topped all 14 of the range\u2019s summits in less than 60 hours.\n\nThe list of contenders on this season\u2019s Nolan\u2019s 14 route \u2014 named after Colorado mountaineer Jim Nolan \u2014 is a who\u2019s who of ultrarunning.\n\nPeter Jones and Kendrick Callaway kicked off the Nolan\u2019s 14 season last month.\n\nJones ran \u2014 with snowshoes in the winter \u2014 up the adjacent Grays and Torreys peaks once a week for a year, logging 728 miles and 275,600 feet of climbing over the year.\n\nCallaway regularly sprints up dozens of fourteeners every summer. The pair made it to the top of their fifth peak, Missouri Mountain, in about 24 hours before realizing they had too little food to make the final self-supported push over nine more summits.\n\nSixty hours seemed possible during their training, when Jones and Callaway pieced together a few peaks at a time.\n\n\u201cBut once you start lining it up together and putting together sections, you realize how big it is. It is just huge. So far, so long, so much vertical,\u201d said Jones, who lives in Boulder. \u201cYou read the trip reports of people who have done it and the level of commitment is beyond what most people can understand. You have to keep going through everything. Rain, pain, sleep deprivation.\u201d\n\nA dozen more racers dropped from the audacious Nolan\u2019s 14 mission in subsequent weeks. Colorado ultrarunning heavyweights Gavin McKenzie of Leadville and Brandon Stapanowich of Manitou Springs were the first to finish in less than 60 hours. They raced the route from north to south from Aug. 29-31, finishing in 56 hours, 21 minutes. The duo share the second fastest time behind the 52-hour, 42-minute record set by John Robinson in 2002.\n\nLike most every Nolan\u2019s 14 contender, McKenzie and Stapanowich are well versed at creating their own challenges, establishing first-ever benchmarks referred to as \u201cfastest known times,\u201d a sort of trophy-less crown noting rarified accomplishments beyond podiums.\n\nTake Stapanowich, who in July ran up and down the Manitou Incline \u2014 an old railroad bed climbing more than 2,000 vertical feet in less than a mile \u2014 22 times in 24 hours, setting what many assume is a world record for the most vertical gained in a single day: 44,000 feet. He dubbed his 24-hour effort the \u201cUltraInclinathon.\u201d\n\nStapanowich\u2019s account of his descent of Mt. Princeton \u2014 the pair\u2019s 11th peak after 48 hours of constant movement \u2014 sounded like a nadir for the veteran endurance racer.\n\n\u201cLoose talus fields made bipedal travel nearly impossible as we crab-walked from lichen rock to lichen rock \u2026 Even finding the trail offered small relief however as the journey began to seem never-ending,\u201d he wrote in his online trip report. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been more tired, as I was literally lifting my eyebrows to keep my eyes open.\u201d\n\nStapanowich said waking up every morning in the shadow of mountains stirs athletes to ponder what many would consider impossible.\n\n\u201cIn a way, the challenges we decide to pursue and ultimately who we are, are at least partially defined by our surroundings,\u201d he said.\n\nBrandon Worthington of Aurora raced north to south, finishing atop Mt. Shavano in 59 hours, 24 minutes, entering the hallowed Nolan\u2019s 14 halls of under-60-hour runners. Worthington estimates he slept less than any other finisher this season, grabbing about 10 minutes of sleep around hour 42. He lost more than an hour finding the trail up Mt. Princeton after that catnap. He was too tired to worry.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have the energy to waste on thinking that the time I lost there cost me the 60 hours in the end,\u201d said the 29-year-old who credits his finish to his support crew.\n\nNolan\u2019s 14 is not a race. Few athletes run it at the same time, but the weather window between snowmelt and snowfall arrives in August and September, creating a sort of \u201cNolan\u2019s season.\u201d Most of the competitiveness is tracked online. Athletes\u2019 GPS coordinates are followed via Facebook or forums such as 14ers.com. The course\u2019s popularity mirrors the exploding participation in formal ultradistance trail races, such as Silverton\u2019s famous Hardrock 100.\n\nMost of the Nolan\u2019s 14 athletes are veterans of the nation\u2019s toughest 100-mile and multi-day ultramarathons. The route, which many consider more difficult than the Hardrock, is a testpiece for athletes well versed in the most grueling running races.\n\nMcKenzie said the popularity of the route increased last year when international endurance superstar Anton Krupicka attempted to run Nolan\u2019s 14 in less than 30 hours, blowing up after five peaks.\n\nAnd the creativity of Nolan\u2019s is alluring, McKenzie said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a given the summits you have to hit but everything in between is up to you. It\u2019s open for interpretation,\u201d he said. \u201cYou choose the route, not the race director.\u201d\n\nAll but two of this season\u2019s racers ran with a support crew that provided food, pacing and encouragement in the transitions between peaks.\n\nBoulder endurance runner Britt Nic Dick bowed out after reaching seven peaks in a little more than 50 hours.\n\nFourteener legend Andrew Hamiltonbecame the first-ever self-supported finisher. The father of four added yet another chapter to his rich history on the state\u2019s highest peaks, which includes a 1999 speed record, a 2003 \u201cself powered\u201d ascent record that saw him pedaling to each trailhead, and, most impressively, climbing all the state\u2019s fourteeners with his son, who notched his first peak at age 4.\n\nEarlier this month Hamilton traveled the Sawatch Range south to north in 57 hours, 18 minutes. Not only did he beat the 60-hour mark, but he ran without any support crew. His energy came from a powder he mixed with stream water. He never stopped to sleep. He followed routes established by previous racers.\n\nHamilton said he wasn\u2019t expecting to even finish.\n\n\u201cI definitely do not have a superhuman ability to endure and suffer. What I do have is a long history of failure in endurance events,\u201d he said. \u201cIn that long string of failures I have learned a lot about myself. I know that it is possible continue through what seems like unendurable pain, and I know that it is possible go without very much sleep, despite what may otherwise seem possible.\u201d\n\nWhen Hamilton reached the trailhead below Mt. Massive after 60 hours, 19 minutes of non-stop running, he thought he had missed his goal by mere minutes.\n\n\u201cHe was kind of bummed because he made a wrong turn descending Massive and lost 30 minutes going down the wrong trail and missing the 60-hour cutoff,\u201d said Matt Mahoney, the unofficial scorekeeper of all Nolan\u2019s 14 attempts. \u201cI told him it was the time to the last summit that counted and it is still a FKT (fastest known time) unsupported since he was the first to do it.\u201d\n\nIn August last year, weather forced Telluride\u2019s Ben Clark off the course after seven peaks. A month later he reached 10 summits \u2014 all of them buried in snow- before a snowstorm pushed him off the Sawatch Range. Earlier this month, flash flooding forced him off Mt. Yale, the 10th peak of his third north-to-south effort.\n\n\u201cMe and this line have been doing the dance,\u201d said the single dad, who retired from Himalayan guiding to stay closer to home, but didn\u2019t give up on mountaineering missions.\n\nA filmmaker, Clark is c rafting a movie on Nolan\u2019s 14. This weekend, Clark returns to the route for a fourth try, vying for a first-known unsupported north-to-south push across the Sawatch Range. And this time he\u2019s aiming simply to finish. Joined by Josh Butson, the owner and lead guide of Telluride Alpinism, Clark wants to finish without any support crew. The pair will carry meager 30-pound packs, following their well-honed light-and-fast mountaineering ethic (you can follow them at share.delorme.com/BenjaminClark).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been about racing the clock in my first three attempts and now it\u2019s about doing on my own terms,\u201d Clark said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s about doing that north-to-south self-supported for the first time and turning it into something original and not force anything. Hopefully we can inspire more people to get out there and spend time in the mountains.\u201d\n\nJason Blevins: 303-954-1374, jblevins@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jasonblevins\n\nRacing to the summits\n\nA look at the attempts to complete Nolan\u2019s 14 in the past few weeks:\n\nAug. 7, 5 p.m.: Peter Jones, Kendrick Callaway start at Leadville Fish Hatchery and end five peaks later at Missouri Mountain around 8 p.m. Aug. 8.\n\nAug. 10, 6 a.m.: Brett and Missy Gosney and Jason Koop start at Leadville Fish Hatchery and end 12 peaks later at 12:30 p.m. Aug. 12.\n\nAug. 24, 6:30 a.m.: Britt Nic Dick starts unsupported and solo at Leadville Fish Hatchery and ends seven peaks later at Mt.
