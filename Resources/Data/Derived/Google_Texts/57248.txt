A capsule — and different — look at elected/public officials in the Texas Panhandle.

Amarillo Mayor

Paul Harpole

■ The basics: 63 years old. Married, two children. Expecting fifth and sixth grandchildren soon. Deer Lodge, Mont., native. Also lived in Denver. Has been in Amarillo since 1982. Owns Paul Harpole Motors. Army veteran. Served in Vietnam (1969-71) as helicopter crew chief (medical evacuation). City commissioner from 2004-05 and in third year as mayor.

■ Best/worst part of being mayor: “The best part is the people. I go to a lot of events, including kids and schools. They are great to be around. The best part is the support of the community. Honestly, I don’t have a part of the job I don’t enjoy. The more challenging part is the discussions, but I enjoy that. It is important.”

■ Hobbies/spare time: “I have loved aviation since I was a kid (Harpole has a pilot’s license). I took my first flight at age 15. I was sold instantly. I love it. It is my best release. I also enjoy fly fishing. I’ve sort of become a poster boy for Amarillo College. I took a fly fishing class at AC, a golf class, ballroom dancing with my wife. I even took harmonica lessons at AC.”

■ Ballroom dancing? Like “Dancing With the Stars?”: “This was prior to ‘Dancing With the Stars,’ but I do OK. I have two audiences that I play the harmonica for — grandkids under 6 and people in old folks’ homes over 80. They are easier to entertain, and they don’t leave you as quickly (laughing).”
