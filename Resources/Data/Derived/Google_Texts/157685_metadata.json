Elizabeth Warren lit up a gathering of liberals with a fiery speech Friday, championing a progressive agenda amid continuing calls for her to reconsider a run for president in 2016.\n\nWarren, D-Mass., held up her campaign to implement the 3-year-old Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as evidence progressive ideas can succeed, even in a political environment still largely overwhelmed by big-moneyed interests and scores of lobbyists. She urged an unrelenting approach in future fights in order to score more victories.\n\n\u201cIf we push back hard, we can win. We fight, we win,\u201d she told the Netroots Nation gathering at the Cobo Center in downtown Detroit. \u201cWe don\u2019t win every time, but we\u2019re learning to win. We\u2019re learning to win and we will keep winning.\u201d\n\n[READ: Joe Biden Interrupted by Anti-Deportation Protesters]\n\nWarren was welcomed to the Netroots stage by chants of \u201cRun, Liz, Run,\u201d spurred by an unaffiliated draft movement to convince her to wage a White House campaign. Warren has repeatedly said she\u2019s not running for president and when she heard the calls onstage Friday morning, she told the audience, \u201cSit down, sit down.\u201d\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop a newly formed group \u2013 Ready for Warren \u2013 from handing out signs, stickers and hats promoting a Warren White House bid before and after she spoke.\n\nWarren\u2019s unwavering call to arms could easily be applied toward a galvanizing message in a national campaign. But it\u2019s more likely that Warren\u2019s true goal was to inspire more activists to join a larger movement she\u2019s content leading from the U.S. Senate.\n\nOn her pet issue of economic inequality and fairness, she plainly laid out the stakes in a vivid way that captivated the crowd.\n\n\u201cA kid gets caught with a few ounces of pot and goes to jail but a big bank launders drug money and no one gets arrested,\u201d she claimed in one of her most popular lines.\n\nShe spent a great deal of time outlining the power of big corporations and the special deals and loopholes they are able to attain because of their outsized influence, but her repeated refrain was a call to political combat.\n\n[ALSO: In Iowa, Chris Christie Finds an Opinion]\n\n\u201cWe can whine about it. We can whimper about it or we can fight back. I\u2019m fighting back,\u201d she said to cheers.\n\nWhile Warren\u2019s speech was devoid of specific policy prescriptions or pieces of legislation, she spent the final few minutes issuing a list of sweeping positions that unite the left, including tougher regulations and oversight of Wall Street and making sure blue-collar families can earn a livable wage and retire with a social safety net.\n\nAfterward, some attendees were visibly inspired by Warren\u2019s address, but also cognizant of the challenges the movement faces.\n\n\u201cIt was overwhelming, it was great. On one hand it made me feel so hopeful. On the other hand, I know that it\u2019s going to be a really big fight,\u201d says Celia Young Wenkel, a retired child protection services worker in Michigan who counts poverty as one of her top issues.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready to go,\u201d a wide-eyed Wenkel continued. \u201cShe\u2019s very inspiring. When she talks, she just nails it.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "The Run 2016 [News]", "title": "Elizabeth Warren Lights Up Netroots Nation in Detroit", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The Massachusetts senator was welcomed by chants urging her to wage an Oval Office campaign.", "title": "Warren Lights Up Netroots Nation", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/run-2016/2014/07/18/elizabeth-warren-lights-up-netroots-nation-in-detroit", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/cb/1f/d38a8fc54b09880d776b9a26c6fc/140718-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "The Massachusetts senator was welcomed by chants urging her to wage an Oval Office campaign.", "card": "summary", "title": "Elizabeth Warren Lights Up Netroots Nation in Detroit"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "July 18, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "David Catanese,Pulse,picks,Warren, Elizabeth,Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,2016 presidential election,The Run 2016 [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The Massachusetts senator was welcomed by chants urging her to wage an Oval Office campaign."}, "article_summary": "We fight, we win,\u201d she told the Netroots Nation gathering at the Cobo Center in downtown Detroit.\nBut it\u2019s more likely that Warren\u2019s true goal was to inspire more activists to join a larger movement she\u2019s content leading from the U.S. Senate.\nDETROIT \u2013 Sen.
