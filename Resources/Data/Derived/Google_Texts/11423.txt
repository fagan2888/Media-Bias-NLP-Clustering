SEATTLE -- Three popular Seattle restaurants are doing away with tipping and replacing it with a new service fee for all customers.



The move is in response to the city's quest to increase the minimum wage and add other benefits for workers.



The restaurants -- the Whale Wins, Walrus and the Carpenter, and Barnacle -- will soon implements an 18.5 percent service fee on all meals. To offset that added cost, the restaurants are banning tips.



Jeremy Price, owner of the Whale Wins, said the change in policy is a reaction to the city's higher minimum wage and the added costs associated with the Affordable Care Act.



"All those things kind of started us thinking about all this," he said.



The change won't happen until May, but customers seem to be okay with the added fee.



"It just removes the ambiguity. It makes it easier to keep track of everything. It's the way they've been doing it in Europe for years," one resident said.



Last month Ivar's became the first restaurant in Seattle to raise their minimum wage to $15 an hour, and the Whale Wins will be the first to eliminate tips.



Price said the change will help balance the pay scale between servers and workers in the back.



"It's going to free up and help us to provide benefits to our employees, health insurance, as well as matching retirement accounts," he said.



The question of banning tips left some customers with a question. What do you do if the service is bad? Price doesn't think that will be an issue.



"We actually kind of believe that our staff is going to do a great job because they're professionals, because they have pride in their work," he said.



Price also said servers will make the same amount of money under the new plan.
