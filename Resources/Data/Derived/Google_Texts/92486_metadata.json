Galloway made critical discoveries linking HPV to cervical and other cancers and her laboratory helped lay the groundwork that made the vaccine\u2019s development possible.\n\n\u201c[The low uptake] has to do with it being considered a vaccine to protect against a sexually transmitted infection, that\u2019s likely the case,\u201d said Galloway in a previous interview. \u201cEven though hepatitis B should fall in that same category, it\u2019s been portrayed more as protecting against a liver disease.\u201d\n\nGalloway and her colleagues at Fred Hutch, which is among the NCI-designated cancer centers issuing the statement in support of HPV vaccination, want parents and adolescents to think about the HPV vaccine in the light of cancer, not sex.\n\n\u201cI think people in the United States are leery of vaccines or they don\u2019t trust pharma or they don\u2019t want to talk about sex,\u201d Galloway said. \u201cSo something that could prevent cancer is not having the impact that it should.\u201d\n\nProactive steps to combat a public health threat\n\nEven though so few U.S. families are following recommendations for this particular vaccine, it is still having a positive effect: HPV infection rates among adolescent girls dropped from nearly 12 percent in the years before the vaccine was routinely available to about 5 percent after the vaccine was introduced in 2006.\n\nThe CDC also estimates that every year, 27,000 men and women are diagnosed with HPV-driven cancers. The majority of these diseases can be prevented with currently available HPV vaccines.\n\n\u201cThe HPV vaccine is an amazing public health advance, but it doesn\u2019t guarantee eradication of HPV. It\u2019s important to remember that the vaccine works best in those who haven\u2019t been infected with the virus, which means, essentially, people who are not yet sexually active,\u201d said Dr. Gary Gilliland, president and director of Fred Hutch.\n\nThe cancer centers\u2019 consensus statement arose from a summit held at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston last November to discuss concerns about low HPV vaccination rates in the U.S. and ways to improve uptake. Experts from more than half of NCI-designated cancer centers, the NCI, CDC and American Cancer Society met at the event, starting conversations to develop the shared endorsement for HPV vaccination.\n\nThe statement also echoes the spirit of President Barack Obama\u2019s recent call for a \u201cmoonshot\u201d to cure cancer. In 2013, the President\u2019s Cancer Panel, comprised of expert advisers to the president on cancer-related topics, chose to focus its yearly report and recommendations on improving HPV vaccine uptake.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s Cancer Panel applauds the NCI-designated cancer centers for issuing this consensus statement urging HPV vaccination for the prevention of cancer in support of the Panel\u2019s recommendations,\u201d Dr. Barbara Rimer, chair of the panel, said in an email. \u201cWe are confident that if HPV vaccination for girls and boys is made a public health priority, hundreds of thousands will be protected from these HPV-associated diseases and cancers over their lifetimes.\u201d\n\nCancer center representatives hope that by joining together, they will send a stronger message to the U.S. public that the vaccine is a safe and important means to prevent potentially deadly cancers.\n\n\u201cEvery day we delay, that means more people are going to get infections that in the future could end up causing cancers that could have been prevented,\u201d said Dr. Melinda Wharton, director of the CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, at the summit. \u201cThere really is great urgency to stop this from happening.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "All 69 National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers are joining together to voice their frustration at the low uptake of the HPV vaccine \u2014 with the hope of refocusing the lens of the vaccination discussion on cancer prevention.", "og": {"site_name": "Fred Hutch", "description": "All 69 National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers are joining together to voice their frustration at the low uptake of the HPV vaccine \u2014 with the hope of refocusing the lens of the vaccination discussion on cancer prevention.", "title": "69 cancer centers join to urge increased HPV vaccination", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://www.fredhutch.org/en/news/center-news/2016/01/hpv-vaccine-debate-reframed-to-focus-on-cancer.pagethumb.resize.1200.630.png", "height": 630}, "url": "http://www.fredhutch.org/en/news/center-news/2016/01/hpv-vaccine-debate-reframed-to-focus-on-cancer.html", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@fredhutch", "image": "https://www.fredhutch.org/en/news/center-news/2016/01/hpv-vaccine-debate-reframed-to-focus-on-cancer.pagethumb.resize.1200.630.png", "description": "All 69 National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers are joining together to voice their frustration at the low uptake of the HPV vaccine \u2014 with the hope of refocusing the lens of the vaccination discussion on cancer prevention.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "69 cancer centers join to urge increased HPV vaccination"}, "robots": "all", "fb": {"admins": 10420423202}, "keywords": "D.
