The complaint is a fictional account of the Oregon Healthcare Project. Oracle is confident that the truth - and Oracle - will prevail in this action and the one filed by Oracle against Cover Oregon two weeks ago in federal court.\n\nOracle was responsible for building the website for Oregon's Obamacare website, called Cover Oregon. But it failed to meet the Oct. 1 deadline last year, and Oregonians are applying for healthcare through paper forms.\n\nOregon eventually killed the website Oracle was building this past April, and moved to the federal exchange instead.\n\nOracle has blamed the state of Oregon for the dysfunctional website, and has charged the state more than $90 million over the last two years, although Cover Oregon is refusing to pay the invoices.\n\nJust two weeks ago, Oracle filed a $20 million lawsuit against Oregon for breach of contract.\n\nAccording to previous reports, the state of Oregon has paid $134 million to Oracle so far, in addition to $7 million for setting up the paper-based process. The site has cost more than $200 million so far for Oracle.\n\nHere are some tweets about the lawsuit via Chelsea Kopta at local Portland TV network, KATU:\n\nBREAKING: Oregon AG sues Oracle \"for defrauding Oregonians in connection with Oracle's failure to provide ... functional website\" #liveonk2 \u2014 Chelsea Kopta (@ChelseaKATU) August 22, 2014\n\nComplaint: Oracle hid from Oregon the \"true extent of Oracle's shoddy performance,\" continuing to promise what it couldn't deliver #liveonk2 \u2014 Chelsea Kopta (@ChelseaKATU) August 22, 2014", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Eugene Kim", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "The lawsuit is seeking more than $200 million in damages.", "creator": "eugenekim222", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/oregon-sues-oracle-for-obamacare-website-2014-8", "image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/53f79058eab8eaaa49edb7b1-506-253/oregon-attorney-general-sues-oracle-over-dysfunctional-obamacare-website.jpg", "title": "Oregon Attorney General Sues Oracle Over Dysfunctional Obamacare Website", "site": "bi_enterprise", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "enterprise,sai", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Oracle, Oregon, Eugene Kim,", "description": "The lawsuit is seeking more than $200 million in damages.", "author": "Eugene Kim", "sailthru.date": "2014-08-22", "sailthru.title": "Oregon Attorney General Sues Oracle Over Dysfunctional Obamacare Website", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/53f79038eab8eaa549edb7b3-50-50/oregon-attorney-general-sues-oracle-over-dysfunctional-obamacare-website.jpg", "news_keywords": "Oracle, Oregon, Eugene Kim,", "tbi-image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/53f79038eab8eaa549edb7b3/oregon-attorney-general-sues-oracle-over-dysfunctional-obamacare-website.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2014-08-22", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/eugene-kim"}, "sailthru.description": "The lawsuit is seeking more than $200 million in damages.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "The lawsuit is seeking more than $200 million in damages.", "title": "Oregon Attorney General Sues Oracle Over Dysfunctional Obamacare Website", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/oregon-sues-oracle-for-obamacare-website-2014-8", "image": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/53f79058eab8eaaa49edb7b1-1190-625/oregon-attorney-general-sues-oracle-over-dysfunctional-obamacare-website.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "Oregon Attorney General Sues Oracle Over Dysfunctional Obamacare Website", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/53f79038eab8eaa549edb7b3/oregon-attorney-general-sues-oracle-over-dysfunctional-obamacare-website.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "enterprise"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3ff1\"", "article_summary": "Oracle was responsible for building the website for Oregon's Obamacare website, called Cover Oregon.\nOracle is confident that the truth - and Oracle - will prevail in this action and the one filed by Oracle against Cover Oregon two weeks ago in federal court.\nOregon eventually killed the website Oracle was building this past April, and moved to the federal exchange instead.\nJust two weeks ago, Oracle filed a $20 million lawsuit against Oregon for breach of contract.\nOregon\u2019s Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum has filed a lawsuit against Oracle for failing to build a functional Affordable Care Act website."}
