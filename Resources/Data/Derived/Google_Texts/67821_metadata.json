So if a family feels they can offer some money, they will. In other communities, sometimes if it's a huge hospital bill, they'll have a bake sale or make a quilt and sell the quilt and will raise money that way,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThey all will just pay cash. So they write checks for whatever services you provide,\u201d Gideonsen said.\n\n\u201cIt's a nice system. If everybody worked together like that, pulled together and cared for those in need, it would probably be a better world.\u201d\n\nRaeder said despite a healthy lifestyle their beliefs can lead to sickness or even death.\n\n\u201cThey're very much with the God's will and do not want a lot of intervention. I've had a few Amish people have cancer and die at home and did not want to do chemo or radiation and that is their choice as an adult.\u201d\n\nGideonsen said they do get discounts from hospitals, but they still pay more than people with Medicare.\n\nAccording to healthcare.gov, these groups could be exempt from the insurance requirement if:\n\n\u2022You\u2019re uninsured for less than 3 months of the year\n\n\u2022The lowest-priced coverage available to you would cost more than 8% of your household income\n\n\u2022You don\u2019t have to file a tax return because your income is too low (Learn about the filing limit.)\n\n\u2022You\u2019re a member of a federally recognized tribe or eligible for services through an Indian Health Services provider\n\n\u2022You\u2019re a member of a recognized health care sharing ministry\n\n\u2022You\u2019re a member of a recognized religious sect with religious objections to insurance, including Social Security and Medicare\n\n\u2022You\u2019re incarcerated, and not awaiting the disposition of charges against you\n\n\u2022You\u2019re not lawfully present in the U.S.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "With many uninsured still struggling with a broken website, one community is avoiding the mess, with help from their neighbors.", "language": "english", "author": "Joe Nelson", "og": {"description": "With many uninsured still struggling with a broken website, one community is avoiding the mess, with help from their neighbors.", "title": "Amish avoid health insurance mandate, pay each other's bills", "url": "http://www.weau.com/home/headlines/Amish-avoid-health-insurance-mandate-pay-each-others-bills-229011351.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/iupl/46A/1F5/46A1F5D14B3D4E119E78F7B80847A119", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/9E0/F69/9E0F69B803EE4ACBA1F222F3075EAE0B.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.weau.com", "description": "With many uninsured still struggling with a broken website, one community is avoiding the mess, with help from their neighbors.", "creator": "@weau13news", "url": "http://www.weau.com/home/headlines/Amish-avoid-health-insurance-mandate-pay-each-others-bills-229011351.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/AMISH+BUILDINGjpg.jpg", "title": "Amish avoid health insurance mandate, pay each other's bills", "site": "@weau13news", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Amish avoid health insurance mandate, pay each other's bills", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "XOlDnT88nYfAApmBC8lwbpWN4wAY0URAWE7v44TsGWU", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Amish avoid health insurance mandate"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd700\"", "article_summary": "Court battles decades ago, awarded the Amish exemptions from government programs, and when it's time to pay for care, cash from church offerings and quilt sales foot the bill, county health care workers said.\nAlthough they live with no cars, electricity or running water, the Amish of Augusta still need medical care.\nRegistered nurse Tammy Raeder with the Eau Claire City County Health Department said she's been treating Amish patients for 22 years.\nWith many uninsured still struggling with a broken website, one community is avoiding the mess, with help from their neighbors.\nWhen they need it, the Amish will get care through home visits, or by riding their buggies into town to be treated for illness or injuries, he said."}
