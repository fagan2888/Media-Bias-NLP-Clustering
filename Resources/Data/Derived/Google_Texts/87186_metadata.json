Every Tuesday night the ladies gather at the AMC All Star Lanes to have a good time and to sharpen their bowling skills as part of the Carter's Lassies ladies bowling league. Some are newcomers and some have belonged for years but all cherish the good times shared each week.\n\n\"We come here for the camaraderie, bowling is the excuse,\" said Judy Townsend, who has been bowling in the league since 1998. Her team, Little Bit O' Luck, has members ranging in age from 29 to 83-year's old with various skill levels.\n\nSisters Martha Tedesco and Maria Martinez have been bowling on Townsend's team for four years. Tedesco encouraged Martinez to join.\n\n\"She wanted me to let loose and have fun. I love to come out and have fun with the girls,\" Martinez said.\n\nThe sisters had little bowling experience before joining the league.\n\n\"All the teammates give you pointers. The more I come, the more I pick up. You don't have to be a pro bowler,\" Martinez said.\n\nThe league uses a handicapped scoring system which allows the games to be more competitive since the handicaps level out the scores. All agree that the bonding is more important than the score.\n\nThe ladies have become a family over the years celebrating birthdays, engagements and weddings, holding baby showers and sharing in personal successes at the weekly gatherings. The relationships built through the league have resulted in traveling groups and they often go out to eat together.\n\nThere have been tough times also, when a loved one or member has passed away. They offered support for each other when several members were battling breast cancer.\n\n\"It's more than just bowling to us, its friendship,\" Tedesco said.\n\nJoyce Woodruff travels in from Hahnville every week to be a part of the group. For her bowling nights are stress relievers from her demanding job.\n\n\"On Tuesdays I leave at 4:30 and my co-workers know not to ask me a question after 4. This is my release, my party night,\" Woodruff said.\n\nThe league was originally formed at the Kenner Triangle Lanes in the early 1970s with a move to the present location in 1983. They are a member of the United States Bowling Congress.\n\nEach league team has five members and plays three games each week. Subs fill in when a member has to miss which isn't often since they have a 95 percent weekly participation rate. There are two seasons with a 16-week summer league and a 30-week winter league.\n\nNew bowlers are invited to join the league and individuals or teams are welcome. The cost is $18 a week which includes the cost of bowling and a prize fund. For information or to join contact Janet Molere at 504.888.4174 or jmolere@att.net.\n\nGarden awards\n\nThe Palm Vista Garden Club recently met at the home of Maria Melendreras with members donning western wear. Co-hostesses for the meeting were Wendy Trocquet, Angie Green, Jan Vincent, Yvette Roman, Anna Lehman and Tina Payton.\n\nThe Garden of the Month awards for February were presented to: Edel Paddock, first place; Sandy Lacour, second place; and Debbie McShane, third place.\n\nThe March Garden of the Month winners were: McShan, first place; Karen Vocke, second place; Yvonne Dietz, third place; and Suzanne Muhleisen, honorable mentioned.\n\nSt. Elizabeth Ann news\n\nSt. Elizabeth Ann Seton Catholic School students are competing at the state level in social studies and geography.\n\nBen Erdozain has qualified to compete in the state National Geographic Geography Bee to be held in Baton Rouge on Apr. 1. Erdozain won the geography bee at SEAS and then tested in the top 100 students in the state to earn the privilege of competing for the state title. The winner of the state title will advance to the national championships to be held in Washington, D.C. in May.\n\nAshley Hebert placed first in the SEAS social studies fair in anthropology with her project on Alcatraz then placed second in state level competition.\n\nOther winners in the SEAS social studies fair are: Anthropology, Ashley Hebert, first place; Donny Allen, second place; Ben Hunn, third place; economics, Camille Vincent, first place; Rachelle Burdine, second place; Jose' Selva, third place; geography, Cody Fruge' first place; Emily Adams, second place; Diego Palomo, third place; history, Hailey Savoie, first place; Dominic Bondio, second place; Micha Pittman, third place; Louisiana history, Alexis Fuentes, first place; Ian Baldwin, second place; Christian Dreis, third place; political science, Drew Gardner, first place; sociology, Alexandra Johnson, first place; Tyler Johnson, second place; and Genesis Argenal, third place.\n\nThere is still time to register for \"33 Days to Morning Glory\" which begins on April 7 at Divine Mercy Catholic Church, 4337 Sal Lentini Parkway, Kenner.
