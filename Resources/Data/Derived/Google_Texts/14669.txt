An Internet connection, a tax return form and a stolen identity are enough to fuel a multi-billion-dollar criminal enterprise that has proven too pervasive to stop.

TERRE HAUTE, Ind. (WTHI) – A local tax expert says the affordable care act will change, or should change, how you file your taxes in 2015. It will also delay when you file and get your refund.

When it comes to the Affordable Care Act, it will affect each and every one of us come tax time. In essence, the affordable care act is an unfunded mandate. It’s the result of an ongoing battle between the White House and Congress.

“Congress has many times tried to repeal this, and so one of the things they’ve done is they have not funded it,” said Andy Stadler, who owns and operates Stadler Tax Service.

Stadler says we’re in for a rough tax season. The IRS requested a budget to help implement the Affordable Care Act. Instead, Congress cut the IRS budget by $341 million.

If you normally call the IRS for advice or guidance, the IRS Commissioner says his agents will only be able to get to 53% of all calls they will receive. So you can expect long wait times.

“Expect a very long wait time, and you’ve got a 50% chance of your phone call even being answered,” said Stadler.

This puts more pressure on tax preparers.

Stadler says Affordable Care Act is $800 billion in tax increases, complete with new tax forms. This will complicate the tax preparation process for everyone, but especially for those who bought health insurance on the marketplace.

“They in particular will have a very difficult time in filling out the forms, even understanding how to fill out the forms. It will be quite complicated,” said Stadler.

Stadler says be careful when choosing a tax preparer. Be sure to hire an enrolled agent or a certified public accountant. Both have experience in tax laws, and both have either federal or state certifications in tax preparation.
