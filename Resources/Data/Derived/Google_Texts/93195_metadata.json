But the biggest money fight of them all may be a real possibility.\n\nMayweather\u2019s next bout is a rematch from May against scrapper Marcos Maidana, on Sept. 13 in Las Vegas. Pacquiao\u2019s Nov. 22 bout in Macau is against Brooklyn\u2019s Chris Algieri, who\u2019s coming off an upset win over Ruslan Provodnikov.\n\nBut if Maidana and Algieri were fighting each other, would it command big bucks on pay-per-view?\n\nThe one fight that remains atop nearly every fight fan\u2019s wishlist \u2014 Mayweather vs. Pacquiao \u2014 also remains the biggest possible payday available in boxing.\n\nAnd Mayweather-Pacquiao is closer to happening now than it has in years, Top Rank promoter Bob Arum told The Denver Post on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one guy who everybody would agree is a megafight (for Pacquiao). And his initials are F.M.,\u201d Arum said.\n\nWhy initials?\n\nPacquiao earlier Thursday joked that the number of Mayweather questions he fields has led him to be \u201cthe one we don\u2019t mention.\u201d\n\nSome boxing fans have soured to the unending talk of a Mayweather vs. Pacquiao bout, now several years in the unmaking. But even if it was better fight three years ago, when the boxers were in their primes, the bout is still not past it\u2019s sell-by date. The long-standing grudge and drama between them alone would make a watchable fight.\n\nArum promotes Pacquiao with an agreement to air fights through HBO. Mayweather is his own promoter and is working with Oscar De La Hoya\u2019s Golden Boy Promotions. His fights air on Showtime. So the rivalry between Mayweather and Pacquiao extends to both their promoters and the networks who air them.\n\nBut that cold war may be thawing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful in the near term that that fight can be made \u2014 way more than before,\u201d Arum said. \u201cBecause it appears to me that both networks, Showtime and HBO. both want to do the fight. They want the fight to happen. So that attitude will permeate both fighters.\u201d\n\nArum\u2019s hopefulness should come with caution among fight fans. He\u2019s currently promoting a fight between Pacquiao and Algieri and any related Mayweather chatter can only help raise awareness of everybody involved.\n\nBut Arum was disappointed in the 750,000 pay-per-view buys for Pacquiao\u2019s last fight, against Tim Bradley. And Mayweather\u2019s first fight against Maidana came in at fewer than 1 million pay-per-view buys.\n\nSo if Pacquiao-Algieri struggles at the box office and Mayweather-Maidana stays low, they could be more eager for a guaranteed big-money fight in 2015.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more optimistic now than I have been in years for that fight to happen,\u201d Arum said. \u201cAs far as Pacquiao is concerend, we\u2019re 100 percent in.\u201d\n\nBut would HBO and Showtime actually be keen on working together? Arum pointed to the Mike Tyson vs. Lennox Lewis fight in 2002 \u2014 when HBO and Showtime agreed to collaborate \u2014 as an example of how Mayweather-Pacquiao might come together.\n\n\u201cWhen Mike Tyson fought Lennox Lewis, Tyson was under contract with Showtime and Lewis was with HBO. And they worked it out. They can can use the same model this time. That was a good road map on how to do it. And I know that on behalf of both networks, they could be interested.\u201d\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Floyd Mayweather vs. Manny Pacquiao more likely now, Bob Arum says", "title": "Floyd Mayweather vs. Manny Pacquiao more likely now, Bob Arum says", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/28/floyd-mayweather-vs-manny-pacquiao-more-likely-now-bob-arum-says/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140828__floyd-mayweatherp1.jpg", "height": 472}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140828__floyd-mayweatherp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-28T18:58:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:48:50+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5a02\"", "article_summary": "The one fight that remains atop nearly every fight fan\u2019s wishlist \u2014 Mayweather vs. Pacquiao \u2014 also remains the biggest possible payday available in boxing.\nFloyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao will each defend their various titles in big-money fights within the next three months.\nPacquiao earlier Thursday joked that the number of Mayweather questions he fields has led him to be \u201cthe one we don\u2019t mention.\u201dSome boxing fans have soured to the unending talk of a Mayweather vs. Pacquiao bout, now several years in the unmaking.\nAnd Mayweather-Pacquiao is closer to happening now than it has in years, Top Rank promoter Bob Arum told The Denver Post on Thursday.\nSo the rivalry between Mayweather and Pacquiao extends to both their promoters and the networks who air them."}
