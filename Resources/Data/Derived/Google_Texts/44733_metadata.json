He and his brothers, Miles, Jeremy, Jerome Jr., and cousin Ty, are in Colorado with the goal of helping the Iroquois Nationals take a run at history at the Federation of International Lacrosse (FIL) World Championship.\n\nThis summer is a united front for the Thompson clan, but next year\u2019s NCAA season will be a big change for Lyle. The co-Tewaaraton Award winner will be going at it alone in his final season at the University of Albany.\n\nGreat Dane fans have been constantly amazed with the skill and grace of the Thompson Trio, which became one of the most prolific attack lines in NCAA history. Miles and Ty have moved on to the professional ranks.\n\nAnd Lyle has a professional career waiting. But for now, he wants to enjoy the journey and see how he can improve on a year where he set the new NCAA single season points record with 128, including an NCAA single season 77 assists and 51 goals.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited for next season. I\u2019m not too worried about any changes I might have to make playing without Miles or Ty,\u201d Lyle told ICTMN. \u201cI\u2019m just going to go out and have fun with it.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Lax Star Jeremy Thompson: Playing With Brothers, Staying Off 'Black Road'\n\nFamily will still surround him. Lyle and longtime girlfriend Amanda Longboat have two daughters Layielle and Mercy Miles. His brother Miles will return to UAlbany and join coach Scott Marr\u2019s staff as an assistant coach.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited with Miles coming back to be a coach,\u201d Lyle said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to work with the guys, so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to be totally alone.\u201d\n\nThe lacrosse world has been focused on the Thompson family for most of Lyle\u2019s life. Production for the Public Broadcast System documentary \u201cMedicine Game: Two Brothers, One Dream,\u201d began in 2005 while Jeremy, 27, and Jerome Jr., 25, were still in junior high school. As it turned out, Jerome Jr., wasn\u2019t able to make the transition into the college classroom, but Jeremy went on to Syracuse. Jeremy was the first in the family to play NCAA lacrosse and the first to sign a professional contract, so he knows a little bit about what lies ahead for his 21-year-old younger brother.\n\n\u201cLyle\u2019s got a pretty good idea of what he needs to do,\u201d said Jeremy, who plays for the Edmonton Rush and the Florida Launch. \u201cHe\u2019s staying focused on the important things. Obviously his family\u2019s important. He\u2019s learning the language and staying connected because he wants to be able to teach that to his kids one day. The biggest thing I\u2019ve learned as a professional athlete playing year-round lacrosse is to keep your mind in tune and to meditate. It\u2019s about staying calm and content and that\u2019s what I tell him.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Thompson Brothers Share LAX Tewaaraton Award, Make History...Again\n\nLyle, who was nominated for the Best Male College Athlete ESPY by ESPN, has maintained a good balance while juggling school, his young family and lacrosse. He is coming off a historical NCAA season, sharing the Tewaaraton Award with Miles. They were the first Natives to receive the prestigious recognition.\n\nHis trophy case includes the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association Outstanding Player of the Year, Outstanding Attackman, First Team All-America and America East Player of the Year.\n\n\u201cHe can definitely be the first-ever, three-time [Tewaaraton Award] finalist. He\u2019ll have to have the numbers, but you\u2019d have to think he\u2019s clearly a favorite to be in the top five,\u201d said Scott Marr. \u201cHe\u2019s excited for the challenge of playing without Miles and Ty. He\u2019s committed, excited and we\u2019re putting the pieces together around him.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lyle Thompson Is Flying Solo", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/14/lyle-thompson-flying-solo-155825", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/lyle_thompson_0.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Lyle Thompson Is Flying Solo"}, "abstract": "Lyle Thompson Is Flying Solo", "dc": {"title": "Lyle Thompson Is Flying Solo"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/14/lyle-thompson-flying-solo-155825", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Lyle Thompson, Thompson trio, Tewaaraton Award, ESPY, University of Albany", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2014-07-14T09:34-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Lyle Thompson Is Flying Solo"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd918b\"", "article_summary": "This summer is a united front for the Thompson clan, but next year\u2019s NCAA season will be a big change for Lyle.\nI\u2019m not too worried about any changes I might have to make playing without Miles or Ty,\u201d Lyle told ICTMN.\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to go out and have fun with it.\u201dRELATED: Lax Star Jeremy Thompson: Playing With Brothers, Staying Off 'Black Road'Family will still surround him.\nFor the next several days, Onondaga lacrosse superstar, Lyle Thompson\u2019s focus is on the prize.\n\u201cHe\u2019s staying focused on the important things."}
