For the nation\u2019s 27-year-olds, premiums shot up by 8.46 percent.\n\nMillennials in some states were hit with double-digit increases. In Alaska, young enrollees in Obamacare saw their premiums increase 28 percent, from $216.12 per month in 2014 to $235.57 in 2015. This is comparable with the 28 percent increase among 50-year-old Alaskans and the 24 percent increase for family rates.\n\nOther states with insurance spikes for millennials are Kansas (17.8 percent), Louisiana (17.22 percent), Minnesota (19.2 percent), North Carolina (15.6 percent), Ohio (19 percent), Pennsylvania (18 percent), Tennessee (18 percent), and Virginia (15 percent).\n\nCommunity Rating Cited As Cause\n\nDr. Roger Stark, a health care policy analyst at the Washington Policy Center and a retired physician, says ACA has a mandate of community rating, which means the young and healthy pay more for insurance than they would in a free market.\n\n\u201cPremium prices for those aged 18\u201334 went up compared to pre-ACA pricing,\u201d Stark said.\n\n\u201cThe individual mandate theoretically forces young adults into the insurance pool [at higher prices], yet many young people are going without insurance and paying the fine or tax,\u201d Stark said.\n\n\u2018Fair\u2019 and Expensive Premiums\n\nMerrill Matthews, a resident scholar with the Institute for Policy Innovation, says every pro-liberty health policy expert had tried to explain to the Democrats writing Obamacare \u201cmodified community rating\u201d\u2014in which the government prohibits insurers from pricing health insurance based on an applicant\u2019s risk factors, allowing only some variation based on age and geography\u2014would drive up the cost of health insurance for younger and healthier people.\n\n\u201cDemocrats refused to listen\u2014well, almost [completely],\u201d Matthews said.\n\nThe Senate version of Obamacare, the version that actually became the law, permitted only a three-to-one spread in premiums, meaning the most expensive premium could only be three times higher than the least expensive, Matthews says. Actuaries say the spread should be more like five-to-one or seven-to-one.\n\nMatthews says the House version allowed only a two-to-one spread, which would have made health insurance even more expensive for young people.\n\n\u201cAnd so premiums are going up for younger people, even though much of the cost is hidden by federal subsidies,\u201d said Matthews. \u201cAnd it will likely only get worse as the [nation\u2019s] population ages.\u201d\n\nIn an attempt to make premiums \u201cfair,\u201d reducing the normally wide variation in premiums, young people, who would normally have very low premiums, have to pay significantly more.\n\nRequired to Overcharge Young\n\nThe price of premiums under Obamacare has always been a guessing game, says Greg Scandlen, founder and director of Consumers for Health Care Choices and a senior fellow at The Heartland Institute, which publishes Health Care News.\n\nInsurers have no idea what kind of risks are enrolling each year because they are not allowed to ask basic health questions, Scandlen says. Without knowing the risks they are attracting, insurers cannot know how much to charge.\n\nThis problem was eased somewhat under Obamacare\u2019s reinsurance risk corridors and risk adjustment programs that subsidized companies that lost money over the first three years. But those programs simply allowed companies to underprice their policies, Scandlen says. Those subsidies will soon no longer be available. Two of them expire in 2016 and the third continues indefinitely, so insurers will have to get more serious about pricing.\n\nThere is an even more important issue in play as well, Scandlen says: Obamacare required insurers to overcharge young people to subsidize older people.\n\n\u2018Fundamental Contradiction\u2019 in ACA\n\nProponents of ACA claimed insuring younger people was one of the most important reasons to support the law, says Scandlen.\n\n\u201cMost of the uninsured have always been under age 30,\u201d Scandlen says. \u201cSo there is a fundamental contradiction: Health plans are required to overcharge the very people they most want to attract.\u201d\n\nThe policy wonks in Washington, DC tried to square this circle by punishing people who failed to enroll and providing subsidies to many who do enroll, but these carrots and sticks are extremely hard to administer, Scandlen says.\n\n\u201cMost of the people who received subsidies are now having to pay back some of the money they got, and the penalties apply only to those who get tax refunds,\u201d Scandlen said.\n\n\u201cThe more complicated this all gets, the more likely young people are to just ignore the whole thing,\u201d Scandlen said. \u201cMost of them don\u2019t think they need health insurance in the first place, so they are not motivated to work through all the complications.\u201d\n\nSean Parnell (sean@impactpolicymanagment.com) is a policy advisor to The Heartland Institute and president of Impact Policy Management, LLC.\n\nInternet Info:\n\nDrew Gonshorowski, \u201c2015 ACA-Exchange-Premiums Update: Premiums Still Rising,\u201d Issue Brief #4366, The Heritage Foundation, March 20, 2015: https://www.heartland.org/policy-documents/2015-aca-exchange-premiums-update-premiums-still-rising", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8b15\"", "article_summary": "Researchers at Heritage found non-group health insurance premiums paid by millennials increased on average 5.3 percent from 2014 to 2015, which is in line with what analysts expected.\nMatthews says the House version allowed only a two-to-one spread, which would have made health insurance even more expensive for young people.\nIn Alaska, young enrollees in Obamacare saw their premiums increase 28 percent, from $216.12 per month in 2014 to $235.57 in 2015.\n\u201cAnd it will likely only get worse as the [nation\u2019s] population ages.\u201dIn an attempt to make premiums \u201cfair,\u201d reducing the normally wide variation in premiums, young people, who would normally have very low premiums, have to pay significantly more.\nThe cost of health insurance premiums for young, healthy Americans have increased significantly under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, at the close of the law\u2019s second open-enrollment period, according to a recent analysis from The Heritage Foundation."}
