But for some families, even that sort of paycheck may not be enough to guarantee they won\u2019t be undone by one emergency.\n\nClose to 1 in 3 households earning more than $75,000 a year live paycheck-to-paycheck at least some of the time, according to a survey released Thursday by SunTrust Bank. More than 1 in 4 households earning more than $100,000 a year said the same.\n\nThe study showed that even households with middle-class earnings can struggle to save. When it came to retirement savings, 43 percent said they\u2019re not saving enough or aren\u2019t sure if they\u2019re on track to have a large enough nest egg.\n\nGranted, some of those low saving rates are due to poor spending habits. Of those who said they weren\u2019t saving as much as they could, 44 percent said it was because they were spending too much money on leisure. For millennials, that jumped up to 71 percent.\n\nThe biggest culprits: 68 percent of people said they spent too much on going out to eat, 37 percent said they did too much shopping, and 35 percent said they overspent on entertainment.\n\nIt could be a sign that people let their spending grow at a faster pace than their paychecks over the years, says Beverly Ladley, an executive with SunTrust. (Think of friends who went out and bought a new car or moved to a bigger apartment as soon as they landed a promotion.) \u201cIt can sound like a lot of money,\u201d she says, \u201cbut when they really understand what their expenses are, what they have left over is not very much.\u201d\n\nThe study didn\u2019t factor in family size or health care needs or other factors that could make it legitimately difficult to live on $75,000 a year. Wages have been nearly flat for several years, making it harder to keep up with rising living expenses, health care costs and tuition costs.\n\nStill, many people might be able to save more if they could get a better handle on where their money was going, Ladley says. People are also better at saving if they have a specific goal in mind like buying a house, planning a vacation or preparing for a baby, she says.\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea to create buckets within the savings account or to open multiple accounts so that each goal can be tracked individually, she says. \u201cOnce they achieve one goal, it actually motivates them to do more,\u201d she says.\n\nBigger goals, broken down into smaller steps, have a similar effect, Ladley says. Take the common advice of setting aside some cash to cover emergencies or other unexpected costs \u2014 which would eliminate the paycheck-to-paycheck scenario. The recommendation of saving six months\u2019 worth of living expenses may seem unattainable, but first save one week\u2019s worth, then one month\u2019s and so on, she says.\n\nConsumers should also get in the habit of boosting their savings every time they get a boost in pay, Ladley says.\n\nJonnelle Marte,\n\nThe Washington Post", "article_metadata": {"description": "Even households with middle-class earnings can struggle to save.", "og": {"description": "Even households with middle-class earnings can struggle to save.", "title": "One third of households making more than $75,000 live paycheck to paycheck", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150419-one-third-of-households-making-more-than-75000-live-paycheck-to-paycheck.ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-04-20T01:30:16Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-04-20T01:21:08Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"One third of households making more than $75,000 live paycheck to paycheck\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150419-one-third-of-households-making-more-than-75000-live-paycheck-to-paycheck.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2264138\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-04-20T01:21:08Z\", \"section\": \"Economy & You Headlines\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-04-20T01:21:08Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3ef6\"", "article_summary": "Close to 1 in 3 households earning more than $75,000 a year live paycheck-to-paycheck at least some of the time, according to a survey released Thursday by SunTrust Bank.\nBut for some families, even that sort of paycheck may not be enough to guarantee they won\u2019t be undone by one emergency.\nThe study showed that even households with middle-class earnings can struggle to save.\nMore than 1 in 4 households earning more than $100,000 a year said the same.\nConsumers should also get in the habit of boosting their savings every time they get a boost in pay, Ladley says."}
