Image courtesy of visually.\n\nYour skin: Not only is it the largest organ in your body, but it\u2019s what makes you, you. Whether you\u2019re pampering it, obsessing over its imperfections, or showing it off at the beach, your skin is something you always strive to be comfortable in. But how much do you actually know about this body part that covers every inch of you? Chances are you may not know enough.\n\nFor instance, were you aware that your skin makes up about 15 percent of your body weight? Skin also varies in thickness, as well as stretchiness and strength on different parts of your body to help those parts serve their different purposes. As you lose over 30,000 dead cells per day, your skin is constantly regenerating, creating 50 percent of the dust you find in your home.\n\nYour skin can be gross at times, too, causing acne due to the overproduction of cells that line sweat glands. But sometimes those unpleasant characteristics aren\u2019t caused by your skin at all; for example, sweat is odorless, but the smell often associated with it comes from bacteria.\n\nAnd how do we care for our skin? Research shows a variety of vitamins aid in the overall health and youth of our skin. For example, vitamin C prevents sun damage, while vitamin E can protect against aging. Like any other organ in our body, skin needs a healthy diet to keep it functioning properly.\n\nby Neomam.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "skin, care, coloring, 50, little, known, facts, about, your, skin", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Your skin is not just the largest organ in your body, but the most dynamic.", "title": "50 Little-Known Facts About Your Skin [INFOGRAPHIC]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/skin-care-coloring-50-little-known-facts-about-your-skin-336380", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/06/03/skin-screenshot_0.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Your skin is not just the largest organ in your body, but the most dynamic.", "title": "50 Little-Known Facts About Your Skin [INFOGRAPHIC]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/skin-care-coloring-50-little-known-facts-about-your-skin-336380", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/06/03/skin-screenshot_0.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/03/skin-screenshot_0.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-06-03T16:46:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-03T16:46:44-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Your skin is not just the largest organ in your body, but the most dynamic."}, "article_summary": "Like any other organ in our body, skin needs a healthy diet to keep it functioning properly.\nFor example, vitamin C prevents sun damage, while vitamin E can protect against aging.\nYour skin: Not only is it the largest organ in your body, but it\u2019s what makes you, you.\nFor instance, were you aware that your skin makes up about 15 percent of your body weight?\nYour skin is not just the largest organ in your body, but the most dynamic."}
