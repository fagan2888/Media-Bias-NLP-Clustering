Other calls, according to police, state that the truck was involved in several crashes.\n\nAccording to police, an officer on an unrelated call saw the truck careen through the intersection of San Jose and Brawley, and collide with a sedan. The truck, according to police, then continued north on Brawley from San Jose, and was then cut off by a Chevrolet truck, which pinned it against the curb.\n\nAccording to Fresno Police, Childers allegedly crashed into the Chevrolet truck while at a store on Shaw Avenue. The Chevrolet truck, according to police, was chasing Childers.\n\nIn addition to the two accidents, Fresno police also said Childers allegedly crashed into another victim, at a grocery store. That victim, however, has not identified himself to police at this time.\n\nChilders, according to Police, suffered moderate facial injuries, but no one else suffered injuries that required hospitalization.\n\nAccording to Fresno police, officers found empty alcoholic beverage cans inside the cab of the Boost Mobile truck, and both alcoholic beverages contain very high alcohol content. In addition, police said Childers' Blood Alcohol Content was over three times the legal limit.\n\nFresno Police said it is quite possible that Childers struck other vehicles, and then departed the scene of those accidents. Anyone who had a collision with the truck are encouraged to call Fresno Police.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A 47-year-old man has been arrested on DUI and other charges, after an accident involving a box truck in Fresno.", "og": {"site_name": "YOURCENTRALVALLEY", "description": "A 47-year-old man has been arrested on DUI and other charges, after an accident involving a box truck in Fresno.", "title": "Driver Arrested After Multiple Accidents", "url": "http://www.yourcentralvalley.com/news/driver-arrested-after-multiple-accidents", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.lakana.com/nxsglobal/feedsite/photo/2016/03/18/Suspected%20DUI-Related%20Accident%20In%20Fresno_7633041_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 663713563761732}, "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2016-03-19T00:49:28+0000", "modified_time": "2016-03-19T00:49:28+0000"}, "keywords": "News,Local News", "google-site-verification": "p7X_hGQYbkiHx_BvKvqgLvEX4UODhhxX7F74f-2XR6U", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe26bd\"", "article_summary": "A 47-year-old man has been arrested on DUI and other charges, after an accident involving a box truck in Fresno.\nChilders, according to Police, suffered moderate facial injuries, but no one else suffered injuries that required hospitalization.\nThe Chevrolet truck, according to police, was chasing Childers.\nIn addition to the two accidents, Fresno police also said Childers allegedly crashed into another victim, at a grocery store.\nFresno Police said it is quite possible that Childers struck other vehicles, and then departed the scene of those accidents."}
