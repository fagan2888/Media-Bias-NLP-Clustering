There were 24 outbreaks by Dec. 6.\n\nThe health department said the best defense in getting a flu vaccine. Even though, this this year, it won\u2019t be as effective. About half of the H3N2 viruses circulating are different from those included in this season\u2019s vaccine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. Viruses change and present a moving target for virologists.\n\nBesides getting a flu shot, the health department says, cover coughs and sneezes, stay away from sick people and wash hands often. \u201cIf you\u2019re sick, stay home from work or school so you don\u2019t spread the virus to others,\u201d the health department advises.\n\nGet updates from Colorado\u2019s weekly flu report .\n\nFor the week ending December 6, influenza activity continued to increase. State\n\nlaboratory surveillance shows that almost all influenza viruses currently circulating in Colorado are the H3N2 virus, the health department reports.\n\nThere were 153 additional hospitalizations reported during the most recent week for which data are available (compared to 57 the previous week ending Nov. 29). Of these reported cases, 51 were from the previous week and 102 were new.\n\nThe state\u2019s cumulative total is 248 hospitalizations in 23 counties.\n\nUpdate: An influenza-associated death of a child was confirmed in Larimer County Monday, Dec. 16. An 18-month-old Loveland girl died from the flu at McKee Medical Center Dec. 9.\n\nCDPHE surveillance for the 2014 \u20132015 influenza season officially began on September 28 and will run through May 23. Current surveillance activities include: reporting of hospitalizations due to influenza, reporting of influenza-like illness\n\nvisits by selected sites, reporting of influenza testing activity by sentinel hospital labs, monitoring circulating influenza viruses through molecular typing at the state public health laboratory, outbreaks of influenza in long-term care facilities (LTCF), and reporting of pediatric deaths due to influenza.", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/health/2014/12/15/mean-season-influenza-strains-year-virulent-fully-covered-vaccine/4694/", "site_name": "The Daily Dose", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/health/files/2014/12/flu-495x724.jpg", "type": "blog", "title": "The mean season: Influenza strains this year virulent and not fully covered by vaccine"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "title": "The mean season: Influenza strains this year virulent and not fully covered by vaccine", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/health/2014/12/15/mean-season-influenza-strains-year-virulent-fully-covered-vaccine/4694/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/health/files/2014/12/flu-495x724.jpg", "creator": "@electadraper", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "follow, all", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "flu,H3N2,influenza"}, "article_summary": "About half of the H3N2 viruses circulating are different from those included in this season\u2019s vaccine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.\nStatelaboratory surveillance shows that almost all influenza viruses currently circulating in Colorado are the H3N2 virus, the health department reports.\nReported influenza hospitalizations and outbreaks in long-term care facilities in Colorado increased in early December.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re sick, stay home from work or school so you don\u2019t spread the virus to others,\u201d the health department advises.\nThe health department said the best defense in getting a flu vaccine."}
