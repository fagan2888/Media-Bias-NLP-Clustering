In a quarterly earnings report issued on Wednesday, the streaming content giant said it had broken through the 40 million barrier in US based subscriptions and its foreign members broke the 20 million mark.\n\nThe company added 2.25 million members domestically, 2.6 million internationally, and reported a Q1 profit of $312 million, exceeding the forecast by $19 million.\n\nFollowing the announcement Netflix stock soared -- by the closing bell on Thursday the price was up 18 percent, finishing at $562.05 per share. Its market value has surpassed that of the old guard mainstay, CBS.\n\nRelated: The Long, Slow Death of Cable Just Reached a Tipping Point\n\nWhile some might see Amazon Prime, HBO Go, SlingTV and Playstation Vue as threats to Netflix\u2019s dominance, CEO Reed Hastings believes that the increasing numbers of streaming service will be good for business as it pushes the future of television firmly into streaming. Recent studies have shown that as much as 30 percent of all television content is now streamed.\n\nOn the content side, Netflix had Q1 successes with the third season flagship show, \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d and the Tina Fey produced comedy, \u201cThe Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.\u201d It\u2019s first entry into a partnership with \u201cDaredevil\u201d (Disney/Marvel) launched to exceptionally good reviews and quickly became second only to \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d as the most pirated show on the web. Late June will mark the role out of the \u201cnetwork\u2019s\u201d other tent pole show, \u201cOrange is the New Black,\u201d which is just beginning to ramp up the media blitz.\n\nIn this flurry of positive numbers, there is still one figure that Netflix keeps close to its vest: How many people are actually watching its most buzzed about shows?\n\nThere is simply no way that Netflix does not have these numbers. Newspapers and magazines rely on audits to and other hard data to prove to advertisers that people are reading their publications; broadcasters know minute by minute how a TV show is performing; Internet companies rely on analytics to determine the performance of their digital properties and as such are able to tell even the briefest of interactions with their websites.\n\nRelated: 'Game of Thrones' Season 5: HBO Cuts the Cord\n\nNetflix knows how many people watched \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d how many episodes in a row they watched, when they paused to go to the bathroom, and when they switched to \u201cThe Real House Wives of Beverly Hills\u201d\u2026no matter what they told their friends. Netflix has these numbers, but they\u2019re under no obligation to release them.\n\nBeginning this summer, Nielsen, the company that measures and rates television viewership, will begin offering data on Netflix (as well as other streaming services), but this will still have limitations.\n\nFirst, they will not be able to track viewership on mobile platforms like phones and tablets. As website traffic increasingly becomes mobile, this will surely exclude a large portion of viewer data.\n\nMore importantly, Nielsen has itself said that it is not really in the business of tracking Netflix viewer behavior and they aren\u2019t concerned with the performance of Netflix original content. The primary purpose of the Nielsen tracking service is that other content networks can track the performance of their back catalog and ultimately decide if they can sponsor these shows.\n\nThey don\u2019t care how many people watch \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d They want to tell CBS how many people are watching 5 year old episodes of \u201cCriminal Minds\u201d.\n\nSo why doesn\u2019t Netflix want to release their own numbers? Would they not want the bragging rights? Well, one immediate answer would be that whatever the actual viewership of these shows, it is almost certainly less than you think.\n\nRelated: Better Call Saul: AMC\u2019s Gutsy Gamble Pays Off\n\nYou would be forgiven -- particularly if you live on the East Coast -- if you were under the impression that the entire world was watching HoC. But a large percentage of this perception is fueled by the fact that it is the exact type of show that appeals to entertainment writers and Beltway bloviators. It is unlikely that any individual episode was viewed more than 3 million times during its initial release. That\u2019s about the average rating for an episode of Fox\u2019s Empire. Ten years ago, it would have been considered abysmal ratings, but the bar has moved.\n\nNetflix would prefer to allow viewers to think of them as Oz, The Great and Powerful, rather than showing the man behind the curtain. But certain revelations in the leaked Sony emails also point to a slightly darker motivation.\n\nA former Sony executive reported a meeting with Netflix in which he was alarmed by their blas\u00e9 attitude towards international piracy. With a minimum of work, international hackers (and I use that word loosely) were able to access content via Netflix that was intended to be blocked in that region. Netflix\u2019s response was basically a shrug. Subscribers are subscribers, who cares what they watch? And if those subscribers were accessing additional content without permission, Netflix is more than happy to turn a blind eye as long as they make their numbers.\n\nAt the end of the day, we may never know the actual ratings on any of these shows. It may not even matter. What is clear, is that Netflix has the spotlight and they don\u2019t intend to let it go.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "To say that it\u2019s been a big week for Netflix would be something of an understatement.", "title": "The One Important Number Netflix Isn\u2019t Giving Out", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/18/One-Important-Number-Netflix-Isn-t-Giving-Out", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04022013_Netflix_Hastings_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/18/One-Important-Number-Netflix-Isn-t-Giving-Out", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04022013_Netflix_Hastings_article.jpg", "creator": "@DrMonkeyPHD", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "To say that it\u2019s been a big week for Netflix would be something of an understatement.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe24c4\"", "article_summary": "Recent studies have shown that as much as 30 percent of all television content is now streamed.\nMore importantly, Nielsen has itself said that it is not really in the business of tracking Netflix viewer behavior and they aren\u2019t concerned with the performance of Netflix original content.\nFollowing the announcement Netflix stock soared -- by the closing bell on Thursday the price was up 18 percent, finishing at $562.05 per share.\nBeginning this summer, Nielsen, the company that measures and rates television viewership, will begin offering data on Netflix (as well as other streaming services), but this will still have limitations.\nWhat is clear, is that Netflix has the spotlight and they don\u2019t intend to let it go."}
