(AP) - A series of coincidences led LSU coach Les Miles to bring in his first Australian punter.\n\nThe Tigers have added two more punters from Down Under since Miles\u2019 wife, Kathy, discovered then-exchange student Brad Wing at a Baton Rouge-area high school football game in 2009. And Miles contends the Aussie influence is changing the way college coaches approach special teams, because they have for him.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve always liked about them is they play Australian football, where their passing is their punt,\u201d Miles said, referring to drop-kicks - often made on the run and under duress - which serve as passes in the Australian game.\n\nThe fact that receiving such passes can mean corralling unpredictable bounces - similar to what American punters might have to do in the event of a bad snap - doesn\u2019t hurt, either.\n\n\u201cSo not only do they come with punting skills, but they come with ball skills,\u201d Miles said.\n\nThe current LSU punter is Jaimie Keehn, whose first live snap, in a 2012 game against North Texas, sailed over his head. Miles smiles as he recalls how fluidly Keehn turned what could have been a negative play into a 38-yard net punt that was downed at the North Texas 16-yard line.\n\n\u201cHe looked and saw where the ball was, ran back that way, measured to see where the opponents that were approaching were and kicked into a void,\u201d Miles said. \u201cSo I thought to myself, it probably couldn\u2019t have been any better for him, because basically that\u2019s exactly what he does in every Australian Rules football game.\u201d\n\nKeehn took over for Wing as the first-team punter in 2013. Next in line to punt at LSU is 22-year-old Josh Growden, who briefly played for the Australian Football League club Greater Western Sydney.\n\n\u201cI think the Aussie fad has kind of caught on now as other schools have seen the success Aussies have had,\u201d Keehn said. \u201cThe results are there.\u201d\n\nThe past two Ray Guy awards, given to college football\u2019s top punter, have gone to Australians. Memphis\u2019 Tom Hornsey won it in 2013 and Utah\u2019s Tom Hackett last season.\n\nAfter the success Miles had with Wing, he began seeking out recruits like Keehn and Growden from ProKick Australia, where former NFL punter Nathan Chapman trains Australian athletes to punt American footballs.\n\nIn Hackett\u2019s view, Australians\u2019 biggest advantage in American football shows up not in the long, booming spirals, but in shorter to mid-range punts, when touch and accuracy are crucial.\n\n\u201cThe Australian Rules background I think is an advantage because, around midfield, they just have to do what they\u2019ve been doing their whole life, by comparison to American punters who probably haven\u2019t really started punting until they were about 12 when they either figured out they were no good to play another position or they were a soccer transfer,\u201d Hackett said. \u201cAnd the game of soccer just doesn\u2019t have the same aspects of Australian Rules football that the American football punter can use.\u201d\n\nNew Orleans Saints punter Thomas Morstead, whose mother is English and who learned rugby as a child from his uncle and cousins, said he still closely follows college punters and has noticed the Australian influence.\n\n\u201cA lot of these Australian kids are ambidextrous, so they can go both ways rolling out, so there\u2019s an element of surprise there,\u201d Morstead said. \u201cWhereas somebody like me, if I tried to kick left-footed, I wouldn\u2019t have a job.\n\n\u201cThe way that they can place the ball on the run is impressive to me, and it\u2019s not just direction, it\u2019s depth,\u201d Morstead added. \u201cIt\u2019s literally like, put a trash can out on the field and they\u2019re getting pretty close.\u201d\n\nCollege coaches now look for such skills in punters, Miles said, and young players in the United States should know that.\n\n\u201cAmerican punters work on that stuff now. They have to. Do they have to compete with Australian punters? They have to compete in punting,\u201d Miles said. \u201cI know I\u2019m thinking differently about my punting. I\u2019m thinking about when I can attack the field and when I should be hitting the boundary.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s the skill of the guy that I have,\u201d Miles said. \u201cIf I have a guy, no matter where he\u2019s from, that has the ability to do different things, I want to be open to that.\u201d\n\nAs for whether Australians are more comfortable running fake punts or making tackles, that depends.\n\n\u201cIf I had the option to run a fake or punt a ball, I would choose to punt every single time,\u201d Hackett said.\n\nWing infamously had a 52-yard touchdown run called back for celebrating shortly before crossing the goal line. That play wasn\u2019t called as a fake, but Miles had told Wing he could run if the receiving team retreated too quickly.\n\nKeehn, meanwhile, said Australian Rules players often \u201clook to lay a big hit and get into good scraps.\u201d\n\nIn America, Keehn added, punters \u201cdon\u2019t get to hit too many people, so when we get a chance, we try to make an impression that will last.\u201d\n\nWith their punting, it seems, they already have.\n\n___\n\nSee a YouTube video of Keehn\u2019s first LSU punt here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3VTGiN-JCo", "article_metadata": {"description": "A series of coincidences led LSU coach Les Miles to bring in his first Australian punter.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A series of coincidences led LSU coach Les Miles to bring in his first Australian punter.", "title": "Australian punters influencing American college football", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/28/australian-punters-influencing-american-college-fo/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/28/26e6521fa2ad6526800f6a7067004117.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/28/26e6521fa2ad6526800f6a7067004117.jpg", "description": "A series of coincidences led LSU coach Les Miles to bring in his first Australian punter.", "card": "summary", "title": "Australian punters influencing American college football"}, "Author": "BRETT MARTEL", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "The fact that receiving such passes can mean corralling unpredictable bounces - similar to what American punters might have to do in the event of a bad snap - doesn\u2019t hurt, either.\nNext in line to punt at LSU is 22-year-old Josh Growden, who briefly played for the Australian Football League club Greater Western Sydney.\nDo they have to compete with Australian punters?\n\u201cAmerican punters work on that stuff now.\nIn Hackett\u2019s view, Australians\u2019 biggest advantage in American football shows up not in the long, booming spirals, but in shorter to mid-range punts, when touch and accuracy are crucial."}
