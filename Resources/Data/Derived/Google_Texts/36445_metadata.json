His team is searching for decomposing remains of approximately 80 victims spread over an area of 8 square miles -- a process expected to take weeks.\n\nHe thanked the warring sides for allowing the mission to proceed, after being delayed most of the week by fighting.\n\n\"This is of great importance to the international police officers, the experts and, especially, the victims' families,\" he said.\n\nRemains are being transferred by refrigerated truck to a facility in Kharkiv, where they can be examined by Dutch, Malaysian and Australian forensic experts.\n\nThey will then be sent on to the Netherlands, to join more than 200 bodies that were collected and transferred in an initial haphazard effort overseen by the rebels. Those remains are now being painstakingly identified.\n\nAalbersberg said his team had been able to search a greater area on Saturday, despite hearing sounds of mortar fire in the distance as they worked.\n\nFriday and Saturday's search focused on the area around a chicken farm near the village of Grabovo, but that phase of the operation is now complete, Aalbersberg said.\n\n\"Tomorrow our goal is to move the search to an area northeast of the village of Rozsypne, where pieces of wreckage from the aircraft have been found,\" he said.\n\nHe added he hopes to expand his team to a full strength of 100 by Monday.\n\nIn Moscow, Russia's Foreign Ministry accused the European Union on Saturday of withdrawing a ban on supplying Ukraine with military technology and equipment \"on the quiet,\" but the EU says it announced the move openly -- two weeks ago.\n\nThe EU decided at the height of violence in Kiev between government forces and protesters to ban the export for goods that can be used for \"repression,\" such as riot gear, tear gas and police batons.\n\nThat measure was lifted on July 16, said EU spokesman Michael Mann.\n\nOn that day, the EU's news release noted in a section on Ukraine: \"Member states also agreed to discontinue the application of their agreement of 20 February 2014 on export licenses.\"\n\nThe West has rejected Russia's denials that it has supplied tanks, armored personnel carriers, rockets and other equipment to rebels in eastern Ukraine.\n\nUkraine has complained that its forces have been attacked by weapons based on the Russian side of the border, while the Russian ministry on Saturday renewed its claims that Ukrainian forces had fired over the border at targets in Russia.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/WORLD/WORLD
