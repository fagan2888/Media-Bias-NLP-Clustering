All the news we couldn't fit anywhere else.

Now it's time to move on to our final game, Lighting Fill In The Blank. Each of our players will have 60 seconds in which to answer as many fill-in-the-blank questions as he or she can. Each correct answer now worth two points. Bill, can you give us the scores?

The jury foreman said after they sent her to jail for 90 days - said that they believed her when she said that she didn't know what the film was, but not, quote, "after the third, fourth and fifth screening."
