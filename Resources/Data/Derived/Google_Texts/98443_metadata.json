Mark Meadows of his subcommittee chairmanship after he defied party leaders.\n\nLevin referred to the top three House leaders \u2014 Speaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Majority Whip Steve Scalise \u2014 as \u201cMoe, Larry and Curley,\u201d with Chaffetz being the \u201cshrimp in there somewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe shrimp I guess would be Jason Chaffetz,\u201d Levin said. \u201cJason Chaffetz is a fraud. Jason Chaffetz pretends to be conservative but is John Boehner\u2019s boy. He\u2019s his lap dog.\u201d\n\nMeadows was one of 34 conservatives who voted against the rule to move the trade deal forward, which will provide the president with fast-track negotiating authority and expand Trade Adjustment Assistance \u2013 a leftwing entitlement program that was added to grease Democrats\u2019 palms.\n\nLevin\u2019s outrage over GOP leaders punishing their own members for fighting to stop what many view as a bad deal with President Obama, was echoed within conservative circles.\n\n\u201cHouse Republican leaders have punished another conservative lawmaker for standing up for our principles,\u201d Senate Conservatives Fund President Ken Cuccinelli said in an email to PPD. \u201cFreedom-loving Americans need to fight back.\u201d\n\nSenate Conservatives have pledged to raise funds for Rep. Meadows until July 1st, at which point the group will start to decide whether to endorse and support him throughout the rest of his campaign.\n\n\u201cBut right now, we\u2019re going to do everything we can to support him,\u201d Cuccinelli added. \u201cThis man is a leader and we need to defend him against these attacks.\u201d\n\nAs Levin rightly pointed out, Speaker Boehner and House leaders have targeted various conservatives in an effort to silence critics and move their particular special interest-favored legislation forward without fail. Meadows, who stated he simply \u201cvoted his conscience,\u201d was made an early example.\n\n\u201cThe Republican establishment is trying to make an example out of Congressman Meadows so other conservatives won\u2019t fight to stop more deals with President Obama later this year,\u201d Cuccinelli added. \u201cSpeaker Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell want to pass a massive highway bailout, raise the debt limit, and save Obamacare\u2019s subsidies and mandates if the Supreme Court strikes them down.\u201d\n\nPPD previously reported and confirmed that McConnell and House leaders are prepared to backstab the base and conservative members if the Supreme Court nixes ObamaCare subsidies this month.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Mark Levin, Jason Chaffetz, Jeff Meadows, chaffetz fraud", "generator": "PPD News Network", "og": {"site_name": "People's Pundit Daily", "description": "Conservative talk radio host Mark Levin ripped House Oversight Committee Chair Jason Chaffetz for stripping Rep.
