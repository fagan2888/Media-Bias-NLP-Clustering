The legislature engaged in a bill-passing marathon Monday, and now each chamber is taking a look at the other chamber\u2019s bills.\n\nGeorgia lawmakers are sprinting to the end of the 2014 legislative session.\n\nThe legislature engaged in a bill-passing marathon Monday, and now each chamber is taking a look at the other chamber\u2019s bills.\n\nAmong the hundreds of measures that have a chance at passage into law this year, one proposal would place a monument to the Ten Commandments in a prominent spot at the Capitol. Another would bar the state from levying ad valorem taxes. There\u2019s also a bill adding a high deductible option to the state employee healthcare plan.\n\nBut which ones are the biggies?\n\nLots Of Bills But Only A Few Count\n\nAnd here's a list of important bills that passed Monday:\n\n*Medical Marijuana: On the House side, lawmakers passed a bill that would legalize medical marijuana for treatment of a rare and disabling seizure disorder. Some lawmakers have voiced opposition because the cannabis oil in question is an untested drug that\u2019s not approved for this use by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\n*The Federal Abortion Mandate Opt-Out: the Senate passed a bill that would nix coverage of abortion under the state employee healthcare plan or any plan purchased through a state healthcare exchange under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n*Medicaid Expansion: the House passed a measure that would strip the Governor\u2019s office of the power to expand Medicaid rolls.\n\n*The Georgia Health Care Freedom and ACA Noncompliance: the House passed a bill that would block the local implementation of the Affordable Healthcare Act. That means no state agency could use its resources to carry out any of the mandates in the federal healthcare reform law.\n\n*Welfare recipient drug-testing: the House passed a bill that would require applicants for welfare to take a drug test to receive the benefits. A similar law is already on the books in Georgia, but has been held up by the courts. This bill will tempt a constitutional challenge if it passes and that makes it important with a capital I.\n\nWhat\u2019s So Important About These Bills?\n\nDo you notice a pattern? Most of the top bills this year relate to healthcare.\n\n\u201cHealthcare is a big issue,\u201d said Tim Sweeney, a healthcare policy analyst for the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s a big part of the economy. \u201c\n\nIn an interview Tuesday, he continued, \u201cIt\u2019s a big issue for individuals. People who don\u2019t have access to healthcare coverage want to get it. People who have coverage want to protect access to the health services they want. And as we\u2019ve seen over the last few years, any changes to the healthcare system can spur lots of passion because it\u2019s so personal and it\u2019s so connected to us.\u201d\n\nOf course that\u2019s in part because this is an election year. And Republicans oppose the ACA almost more than anything else. And the most active part of the GOP electorate wants to see it blocked in Georgia. That means it\u2019s good politics to keep up a steady diet of bills to defund, dethrone and dilute the federal healthcare reform. And all of it despite a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court upholding most of the law.\n\n\u201cClearly that issue is being decided at federal level, but there are some state legislators that have found some ways they believe they can influence [the issue] as well as show their constituents that they are trying to do what they want done,\u201d said Charlie Harper, a right-leaning policy advisor.\n\nBut there\u2019s another thread here: sustainability. The GOP doesn\u2019t see the federal healthcare reform law as a manageable economic load for years to come.\n\n\u201cYou have to ask yourself, \u2018What is sustainable?\u2019\u201d said Rep. Jeff Chapman in an interview Tuesday.\n\nChapman, a Brunswick Republican, voted in favor of stripping the Governor of the power to expand Medicaid. And he also backed barring state agencies from carrying out any of the mandates contained in the ACA.\n\nBut here\u2019s something he didn\u2019t vote for: the medical marijuana bill.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re in over our heads and we are outside the realm of our expertise,\u201d he said about the measure that would expand the authorized use of cannabis oil. \u201cI was not convinced that this was the right thing for us to be involved in. I could be wrong and it passed.\u201d\n\nAs for opposing the ACA, Chapman says you have to do more than just oppose it.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just say no. You need to be responsible enough to offer a better choice,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what the public is hearing a lot about.\u201d\n\nA New Kind of Power Play\n\nBut the bill that might have the longer legacy is the one that gives the legislature the power to expand Medicaid.\n\nAnd it\u2019s also a bill that opens up a new legislative precedent.\n\nThe executive and legislative branches of government normally tussle over who gets more power. And Tom Crawford, who edits the Georgia Report, an online political digest, said normally a governor would veto a bill that stripped him of a particular authority.\n\n\u201cIn this case, the head of the executive branch, Gov. Deal, doesn\u2019t have a problem with the legislature taking that particular grant of authority so that makes it a bit unusual,\u201d he said. \u201cGenerally a governor tries to hold onto as much power as he can while a legislature tries to get as much power as they can.\u201d\n\nThat wrinkle is Georgia\u2019s special stamp on the ACA conundrum.\n\nAs for the legislative session, Republicans hold pretty much all of the power so all of these measures have a good chance at final passage. The question will be, how does each chamber handle the pet projects of the other? Often times, people in the same party but different chambers don\u2019t play nice after bills cross over. That\u2019s in part due to a rivalry between the two houses of the legislature.\n\nSlowing Down To Speed Up Later\n\nTuesday was a slow day at the Capitol. But Wednesday promises a little more action. The biggest pot-stirrer is likely to be a hearing on a bill that would restrict Georgia\u2019s participation in the Common Core educational standards. The Senate passed it, and now the House gets to put the measure through its paces.\n\nAs one lobbyist put it, \u201cThere are hundreds of bills to look over each session. But it\u2019s not serious until they cross over. And now they\u2019ve crossed over.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"meta_title": "Here Are The Georgia Bills To Watch In 2014", "medium": "News", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Georgia Public Broadcasting", "description": "Georgia lawmakers now have their sights set firmly on March 20 when the 40-day 2014 legislative session will end.
