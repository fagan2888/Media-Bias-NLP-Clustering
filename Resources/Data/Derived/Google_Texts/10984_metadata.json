About 46 percent of those doctors were listed twice, however.\n\nThe researchers then attempted to make appointments with dermatologists, for a fictional father who had an itch for months and was about to select a Medicare Advantage plan.\n\nOf the remaining 2,590 dermatologists listed in the directories, about 18 percent were not reachable, about 9 percent had retired, died or moved and another 9 percent were not accepting new patients.\n\nOverall, only 1,266 dermatologists \u2013 or less than half \u2013 were reachable, accepted the specific Medicare Advantage plan and offered an appointment.\n\nFor one of the plans, the researchers were not able to make an appointment with any of the listed dermatologists.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the average time the fictitious patients had to wait for an appointment was about 46 days.\n\nResneck said different plans in different geographic areas varied in the accuracy of their directories.\n\n\u201cAcross the board, nobody scored that well here,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought because of the attention that had been paid to this, I thought insurers would have paid some attention to cleaning up these directories.\u201d\n\nThe researchers note that they can\u2019t tell whether the inaccurate directories are misleading federal regulators, because they weren\u2019t able to access the reports that health plans submit to the government.\n\nThey also don't know if the results would be similar for other medical specialties.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t say for sure, but I see no reason why insurance companies would have a particularly difficult time keeping their dermatology directories up to date,\u201d Resneck said.\n\nEarlier this month, a study found many errors in insurance directories of psychiatrists (see Reuters Health story of October 17, 2014 here: reut.rs/1039tdK).\n\n\"Medicare Advantage plans do provide a wide range of providers and specialists to meet beneficiaries\u2019 diverse health needs,\" said Clare Krusing, director of communications for America's Health Insurance Plans, which is the national trade association representing the insurance industry.\n\n\"There is a shared responsibility between providers and health plans to ensure seniors have access to the care and resources they need when it comes to their health care choices,\" Krusing added in her email to Reuters Health. \"Greater transparency on the part of those specialists participating in provider networks is critical to making this happen.\"\n\nResneck said insurance companies should \u201chit the pause button\u201d before removing any more providers from their insurance plans.\n\n\u201cTaking more and more physicians out of an insurance network when there is already a long wait can only make that worse,\u201d he said.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/10z87bK JAMA Dermatology, online October 29, 2014.", "article_metadata": {"DCSext.ContentID_healthNews": "USKBN0II2FQ20141029", "sailthru.author": "Andrew  M.
