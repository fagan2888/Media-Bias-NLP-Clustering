Another said they are playing catch-up on all their bills.\n\n\u201cMy pap probably can\u2019t afford to send me to junior college,\u201d said the youngest worker at a crowded table of employees, still in their black Market Square uniforms.\n\nTo approximately 70 percent of Sodexo employees who work at Market Square, benefits cuts caused by a change in company policy have hit hard and close to home.\n\nLast fall, TCU\u2019s food contractor Sodexo, citing the Affordable Care Act (ACA), announced that the company would restructure its definitions of part-time and full-time employment.\n\nThe new definition of full-time employment is working an average of 30 hours a week over the entire year instead of working 30 hours a week for at least six weeks each quarter.\n\nThis change prevented some employees at Market Square, who work fewer hours during university breaks with lower student traffic, from staying classified as full-time employees.\n\nAfter the change, as many as 77 TCU Sodexo workers who were previously full-time employees were reclassified as part-time workers. They lost benefits such as health care insurance and sick leave.\n\nAhead of a looming election on union membership, five of those employees talked to TCU 360 in a group interview about their lives and their workplace environment after the cuts took effect Jan. 1.\n\nTCU 360 was put in contact with these employees through a local union organizer, Abraham Wangnoo, who was also a part of the interview. The employees identified as Sodexo workers at TCU and declined to provide their names or specific positions for fear of being disciplined or losing their jobs.\n\n\u201cTaking away the vacation and cutting the attendance points takes away more opportunities for people to get that time off work when they really need it,\u201d Wangnoo said. \u201c[The benefits cuts] laid the ground work in which if they wanted to terminate somebody they could get to that point faster.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe lost insurance, dental, vacation, sick-pay, holiday pay,\u201d said one Dining Services employee of several years. \u201cEverything is gone.\u201d\n\nAnother employee said workers may come in to work sick because of fewer sick days.\n\nWangnoo, of the United Food and Commercial Worker\u2019s Local 1000 union, which represents food commercial and production workers in Texas and Oklahoma, said that some Sodexo employees quit after the benefits cuts were announced.\n\n\u201cNew people haven\u2019t been through what everyone else has been through,\u201d Wangnoo said, \u201cIf you haven\u2019t lost it, you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to lose it.\u201d\n\nWangnoo said he felt in early February that the majority of Sodexo employees at TCU were interested in potential union representation. Momentum pointed toward a first at TCU: unionized dining services employees.\n\nNews of a Sodexo job fair at Union Grounds early last month motivated Wangnoo and the UFCW union to take action.\n\n\u201cWe were nervous,\u201d said Wangnoo. \u201cWe kind of thought that they [Sodexo] were going to hire in a lot of new people.\u201d\n\nOn February 10, according to a federal document obtained by TCU 360, UFCW\u2019s Local 1000 Union filed a petition to set up a union election for TCU\u2019s Sodexo employees in Market Square.\n\nMultiple Sodexo officials either could not be contacted or declined to comment if Sodexo favored or opposed a unionized workplace at TCU.\n\n\u201cWe stand by our previous responses about the company respecting the rights of employees to unionize and will decline to discuss the ongoing events at TCU further out of respect for the process,\u201d Stephen Miller, general manager of Sodexo at TCU, wrote in an email.\n\n\n\nTCU Director of Communications Lisa Albert wrote in an email that the right to organize, as well as the outcome of the vote, is a matter between Sodexo and its employees.\n\n\u201cTCU respects the rights of Sodexo employees to decide what is best for each of them,\u201d Albert wrote. \u201cAt the request of Sodexo management, the University Union will provide a neutral voting location.\u201d\n\nSodexo and Labor\n\nThe upcoming union vote, scheduled for March 24, will determine if TCU\u2019s Sodexo workers will be able to join the UFCW labor union.\n\nUnion elections, such as the one on the 24th, are established and monitored by the federal National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).\n\nThe NLRB is a federal agency tasked with conducting union representation elections and investigating charges of unfair labor practices. Located in Fort Worth, the NLRB\u2019s Region 16 office serves most of Texas and part of Arkansas. They will oversee this election.\n\nAccording to National Labor Relations Board policy, the election process for union representation must begin with a petition that shows at least 30 percent of employees are interested in a union.\n\nNLRB officials then confirm that the agency can rule over the matter and that there is no existing labor contract barring an election.\n\n\u201cOur job is to attempt to maintain \u2018laboratory conditions\u2019 for a vote,\u201d said Martha Kinard, the NLRB Regional Director for Region 16.\n\nThe phrase \u201claboratory conditions\u201d commonly used in labor law circles comes from a 1948 court case emphasizing that the NLRB\u2019s philosophy should be to serve as a neutral judge favoring neither the union nor the employer ahead of an election.\n\nThe phrase implies the agency should try to determine the \u201cuninhibited desires of the employees.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want it so employees can vote for or against the union as desired,\u201d said Kinard.\n\nKinard said the employer and the petitioner, Sodexo and the UFCW respectively, agreed on an election date, election location and terms of who could vote in the election, but that the list of eligible voters is not being made public.\n\nIf more than half of the eligible Sodexo workers vote in favor of union membership, employees will be able to join UFCW\u2019s Local 1000 union, pay dues and elect representatives to negotiate with Sodexo. Under Texas\u2019 right-to-work status, employees are free to not join the union or pay any of its dues.\n\n\u201cSodexo stands by the results of any valid secret ballot election that is monitored by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and is free of objectionable conduct,\u201d wrote Gregory Yost, senior manager of media relations at Sodexo, in an email.\n\nYost also wrote that the company already works with more than 30 labor unions. He said more than 15 percent of Sodexo employees are union members through 330 collective bargaining agreements.\n\nWangnoo and the Market Square employees say Sodexo managers have held meetings with employees that emphasize the cons of union membership. Wangnoo says he thinks these meetings are used to paint union membership in a negative light to those without extensive knowledge of unions.\n\n\u201cThe meetings are becoming more segregated,\u201d said Wangnoo, \u201cSo a union supporter that\u2019s got a lot of knowledge isn\u2019t put into a meeting with people who have none.\u201d\n\nWangnoo added that Sodexo management has encouraged employees to not talk to union organizers and \u201cto slam the door in our face.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only reason anybody got to go to anybody\u2019s house is the union doesn\u2019t have the access to TCU like Sodexo does,\u201d said the Dining Services employee. \u201cIf (Wangnoo) had access to speak to the employees, there\u2019s no need to come to their house. But he don\u2019t have access.\u201d\n\nAs Kinard confirmed, employers have the freedom of speech and right to express their opinions about the utility of unions in a workplace, even close to an election.\n\nAccording to the Society for Human Resource Management, the world\u2019s largest HR membership organization, American employers are legally allowed to \u201curge employees to vote against the union and to suggest that they encourage others to do the same.\u201d\n\nThe NLRB, however, is tasked with investigating unfair labor practices (ULPs). In the context of union elections, these typically involve threats of disciplining or firing employees for their personal positions on unionization.\n\nWhen asked if he thought there had been unfair labor practices, instances of intimidation or unfair discipline at TCU, Wangnoo replied, \u201cWe do have specific instances we\u2019re concerned about.\u201d\n\nOver Our Heads\n\n\u201cThese meetings go on in the third floor of the BLUU and the students don\u2019t even know nothing,\u201d one employee said about the meetings.\n\nTCU 360 cannot independently verify the existence of these meetings that the Sodexo employees reported on the third floor of the BLUU over Market Square before and after work shifts.\n\nThe president of the campus National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) chapter, a student organization who Wangnoo identified as activist on the issue of the union vote, says he and other NAACP members have heard anecdotes about the meetings.\n\n\u201cI can say I\u2019ve heard rumors from employees that they feel like they\u2019re being coerced and other employees are being coerced not to join the union,\u201d said Essie Craft, a senior psychology major and president of the campus NAACP chapter.\n\nWangnoo said the UFCW would not hesitate to file charges of an unfair labor practice with the NLRB when someone\u2019s job was at risk or where someone was improperly disciplined. Despite this, he says the main focus at the moment is on the election March 24.\n\nAlthough multiple Sodexo officials declined to discuss the outcome of the election, Wangnoo says he feels there\u2019s a \u201cgreat chance\u201d the majority of workers will vote in favor of the union.\n\nCraft said that the NAACP is still paying close attention to the union vote because of its core organizational purpose.\n\n\u201cDemographically, African Americans and Latinos make up most of the workers,\u201d Craft said. \u201cIt is an NAACP issue that the NAACP is designed for.\u201d\n\nCraft said his organization wants to spread awareness about the importance of the loss of benefits to Sodexo workers.\n\n\u201cLosing benefits might just look like a piece of paper or something, but to the actual person it affects, that\u2019s livelihood: that\u2019s food, shelter, water, clothing,\u201d Craft said..\n\nWhile the benefits cuts have been delayed at some colleges, like administrative resistance or delays at several colleges in Vermont, the cuts have remained in effect here at TCU for almost three months.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re working at one of the premier universities in the state and you can\u2019t afford to send your kids to technical school,\u201d remarked Wangnoo in the discussion with the workers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re feeding future politicians and future NFL players and things like that every day.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "One worker said he and his family had to downgrade from a house to an apartment.\u00a0Another said they are playing catch-up on all their bills. \u201cMy pap probably can\u2019t afford to send me to junior college,\u201d said the youngest worker at a crowded table of employees, still in their black Market Square uniforms.
