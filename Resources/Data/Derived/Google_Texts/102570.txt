CHI Franciscan Health, with eight hospitals and more than 100 clinics serving the greater Tacoma region of Washington, has plenty of challenges in the new healthcare environment spawned by the Affordable Care Act, and it is looking for start-up companies to help develop new technologies.

Two big challenges include increased efficiency of surgical schedules by helping surgeons better determine how long a procedure will take, and a range of changing healthcare consumer expectations, says Thomas Kruse, chief strategy, integration and innovation officer at CHI Franciscan.
