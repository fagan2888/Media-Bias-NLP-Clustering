(Estimates of the uninsured vary a lot depending on which survey you choose and how you define the term.) And the Affordable Care Act, according to CBO, will reduce that number significantly. Without the law, CBO says, the number of uninsured Americans would stay at roughly 57 million. But thanks to the various coverage expansions\u2014not just the creation of new private insurance marketplaces, but also the expansion of Medicaid and ability of young adults to stay on their parents\u2019 plans\u2014the number of uninsured will decline markedly. By 2017, according to CBO, Obamacare will have reduced the number of Americans without insurance by nearly half\u2014or more, if you don't count undocumented workers.\n\nThese are obviously just projections, based on CBO's assessment of past programs that have made health insurance more widely available. There's a separate, totally legitimate argument over whether the law will actually reach these goals. My own guess is that it will fall a bit short in the first few years and then catch up over time. But it will be months and, really, years before we know whether that's happening\u2014and that's not what folks like Podhoretz are arguing here.\n\nIn a follow-up for Commentary, Podhoretz defended his argument:\n\nIf 31 million uninsured was unacceptable in 2009 and the key fact in creating this new $2 trillion program, how could the projection that there will be 31 million uninsured in 2024 be considered an endorsement of ObamaCare\u2019s success? In any case, what is missing from any such projection is the fact that one way or another, had there been no ObamaCare, there would still have been significant revision at some point of the health-care system, which everyone acknowledges is broken. Since we can\u2019t know what other changes might have been made, we can\u2019t possibly know how many uninsured there might have been in this alternate 2024.\n\nNo, we can\u2019t know what other changes might have taken place. But we have a pretty good idea. Liberals settled on something like Obamacare, which they realize will reach only about half of the uninsured for now, because they had literally spent decades trying to do something more ambitious\u2014only to fail, thanks in no small part to conservative opposition. And while conservatives like to say they have better ideas for reforming health care, their proposals inevitably result in many fewer people getting coverage\u2014or those getting coverage getting significantly less financial protection.\n\nAs best as I can tell, most conservatives simply believe that the costs of significantly expanding coverage are too high to justify the benefits. Fine. But if they want to make that argument, they need to be candid about how significant those benefits are likely to be.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Conservatives have a new favorite argument on Obamacare that, like so many right-wing talking points, is overdue for context and correction.&nbsp;The claim is that the Affordable Care Act won\u2019t do much good, because, even after the law has taken full effect, the number of uninsured Americans will be roughly the same as it is now.
