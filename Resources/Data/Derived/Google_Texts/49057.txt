Police investigators believe the man suspected in the shooting death of a Pennsylvania state trooper was spotted in the woods of eastern Pennsylvania on Friday night.

A woman told police investigators that she had seen Eric Matthew Frein, the subject of a massive manhunt, dressed in all black. Frein was not far from Pocono Mountain East High School, according to CNN.

Frein's face was described as being covered in mud and he was said to be armed with a long rifle with a scope.

The 31-year-old Frein is suspected in the Sept. 12 ambush that killed Cpl. Bryon Dickson and wounded trooper Alex Douglass outside the Pennsylvania State Police barracks.

CNN reports that authorities believe the man seen Friday was Frein and are renewing focus on the area. Frein used to attend the local high school in Swiftwater, Pa., and used to work at a camp in the area.

ABC News reported the new sighting has "high credibility" with investigators.

Frein has been described as a survivalist with a hatred for law enforcement. He has managed to elude a manhunt that has sometimes numbered 1,000 officers.
