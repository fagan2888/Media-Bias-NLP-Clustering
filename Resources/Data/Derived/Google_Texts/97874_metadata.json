She was stalked and threatened while in an abusive relationship in college. Kazantsev regularly speaks at domestic violence and homeless shelters, and currently volunteers with Safe Horizon, one of the country\u2019s leading organizations working to support victims of domestic abuse.\n\n\u201cThe main goal is to get people talking about it,\u201d Kazantsev explained in an interview with NPR. \u201cIf people are willing to talk about it, they\u2019re not scared of it, it\u2019s not taboo.\u201d\n\nThe issue of domestic violence was front and center at last night\u2019s pageant. In addition to Kazantsev, several other contestants also chose to focus on the issue in their platforms. And this year\u2019s Miss America judges drew some criticism for asking contestants to weigh in on the recent controversy surrounding former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice, who was dropped from the team after surveillance video showed him punching his then-fiancee. Rice\u2019s wife has chosen to remain with him. \u201cAs a woman, what do you think of her decision?\u201d one of the judges asked a contestant \u2014 sparking complaints that the question\u2019s framing relied on victim-blaming and pitting women against other women.\n\nKazantsev is clear about the fact that she doesn\u2019t believe that\u2019s an appropriate question to ask of domestic abuse victims.\n\n\u201cI want people to stop asking, \u2018Why doesn\u2019t she just leave?\u2019 \u201d the Miss America winner told NPR. \u201cEvery woman is an expert in her own case, and there are so many extenuating circumstances that lead to a woman staying with her abuser.\u201d\n\nIssues related to domestic violence, as well as questions about how to create a culture that supports survivors, have been dominating the headlines recently thanks to the ongoing fallout from the NFL\u2019s handling of the Ray Rice incident. Women\u2019s groups have called on the NFL commissioner to resign, and the feminist activist organization UltraViolet flew banners over several football stadiums this weekend declaring that \u201cGoodell Must Go.\u201d Meanwhile, thousands of women with personal experiences with domestic violence have pushed back on the idea that victims should simply leave under the hashtag #WhyIStayed.\n\nKazantsev\u2019s comments about victim blaming echo recent statements from Vice President Joe Biden, who \u2014 as the original sponsor of the Violence Against Women Act \u2014 frequently speaks out on the topic. \u201cThis whole culture for so long has put the onus on the woman,\u201d he told the Today Show. \u201cWhat were you wearing? What did you say? What did you do to provoke? That is never the appropriate question.\u201d\n\nPageant contestants are increasingly using their spotlight to shed light on issues that may not typically get much attention on the stage. Earlier this summer, Miss Idaho made national headlines for visibly wearing her insulin pump during the swimsuit portion of the competition, bringing more awareness to the millions of Americans living with Type 1 diabetes. And after one of the contestants in this year\u2019s Miss USA pageant was widely praised for having a more \u201cnormal body\u201d that isn\u2019t stick thin, it sparked a larger conversation about the media\u2019s unrealistic portrayals of women\u2019s bodies.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The newly crowned Miss America is making domestic violence her platform issue.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The newly crowned Miss America is making domestic violence her platform issue.", "title": "Miss America\u2019s Bold Statement On The Ray Rice Assault", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/09/15/3567396/miss-america-victim-blaming/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/AP673170805000-e1410795656136.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The newly crowned Miss America is making domestic violence her platform issue.", "title": "Miss America\u2019s Bold Statement On The Ray Rice Assault", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/AP673170805000-e1410795656136-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/AP673170805000-e1410795656136.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/AP673170805000-e1410795656136.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-15T12:04:59+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd138d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI want people to stop asking, \u2018Why doesn\u2019t she just leave?\u2019 \u201d the Miss America winner told NPR.\nKira Kazantsev, who entered the competition as Miss New York, is herself a survivor of domestic violence.\n\u201cIf people are willing to talk about it, they\u2019re not scared of it, it\u2019s not taboo.\u201dThe issue of domestic violence was front and center at last night\u2019s pageant.\nHealth Miss America\u2019s Bold Statement On The Ray Rice Assault CREDIT: AP Photo/Mel Evans Miss New York Kira Kazantsev is crowned as the new Miss AmericaThe newly crowned Miss America is hoping to use her platform to draw attention to a topic that she says has been stigmatized for too long: Intimate partner violence and how society can best support women in abusive relationships.\nKazantsev regularly speaks at domestic violence and homeless shelters, and currently volunteers with Safe Horizon, one of the country\u2019s leading organizations working to support victims of domestic abuse."}
