In a letter sent to Clinton’s lawyers today, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC), chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, has requested former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to appear before the committee to address questions relating to her private email system and the 2012 terrorist attacks in Libya. Gowdy noted that both David Kendall–Clinton’s lawyer–and Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD)–the committee’s ranking member–agreed to have the former first lady appear before the Committee sometime in November of 2014. This was obviously before we knew that Clinton had used a private email address for all State Department business, had operated a personal server, and had submitted emails the former secretary of state deemed work-related; all of this was included in the letter.

“Thank goodness the Committee did not schedule Secretary Clinton’s appearance when some asked us to, or else that hearing would have been woefully and now obviously premature,” Gowdy wrote. He also reiterated how a transcribed interview, which was rejected by Clinton’s legal team, should have been an option for the former first lady–and that the Committee is willing to travel to her “if that would make the scheduling of this interview easier for the Secretary.”

Gowdy also said that if she chose to appear before the Committee, they “would anticipate the hearing lasting until all relevant questions have been asked on both sides of the aisle.” They’re hoping to have this public hearing the week of May 18.

The letter contained over 100 sample questions for Hillary Clinton regarding the use of her private email account.

He also requested the former secretary to testify twice to the Committee from the press release issued earlier today, and reiterated some of the points mentioned in the letter to Clinton’s lawyers–specifically not having Clinton appear on the original date that was set:
