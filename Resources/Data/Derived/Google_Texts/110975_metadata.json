Sheila Jackson Lee.\n\nDespite the fact that thousands and potentially millions of Americans have had their plans canceled due to noncompliance with minimum standards of the Affordable Care Act, that's just no big deal to Rep. Lee.\n\nSpeaking to National Review Online (emphasis added):\n\nRepresentative Sheila Jackson Lee, a Texas Democrat, told National Review Online today that instead of sending out cancellation letters, insurance companies should have told their customers that their coverage was about to get better. She said she wrote an amendment before the president\u2019s announcement that would require insurance companies to \u201ctell the truth.\u201d \u201cThe cancellation notice was not the truth,\u201d she says. \u201cIt should have been: \u2019We intend to or expect to modify your insurance.\u2019\u201d\n\nReally, Rep. Lee? Really? How else could you possibly describe a letter from an insurance company that blatantly states that their plan will no longer be offered due to Obamacare? It is, in the literal sense of the word, a cancellation letter.\n\nAnd that's the truth.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Out of touch?.05/23/2016 22:26:42PM EST.", "author": "Christine Rousselle", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Out of touch?", "title": "- Rep.
