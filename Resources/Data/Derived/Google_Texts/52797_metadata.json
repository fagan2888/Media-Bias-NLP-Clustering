Andrew Cuomo joined New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio at a press conference to update an anxious public on the status of the city\u2019s first Ebola patient.\n\nThe men were joined at the Bellevue Hospital Center briefing on Oct. 23, 2014, by New York City Health Commissioner Mary Bassett and Dr. Ramanathan Raju, the city\u2019s public hospitals chief. The measured tone of the presentation exuded a calm competence that the city, the nation, indeed the world needed at a time when bungled public health responses, both in West Africa and Houston, had raised serious concerns about the world\u2019s ability to respond to the deadly disease.\n\nAll these months later, it\u2019s easy to forget the anxiety as 100 medical professionals succumbed to the exotic infectious disease, with many more falling gravely ill. Ebola had easily jumped oceans with a jet-age efficiency, faster than it appeared we could fashion a response to stop its advance.\n\nAs it turned out, consistent public investment in New York City\u2019s municipal health system, which dates back to the 19th century, was paying real dividends of global consequence in the 21st.\n\n\u201cAnd we want to emphasize that New York City has the world\u2019s strongest public health system, the world\u2019s leading medical experts, and the world\u2019s most advanced medical equipment,\u201d de Blasio told reporters that day. \u201cWe have been preparing for months for the threat posed by Ebola. We have clear and strong protocols, which are being scrupulously followed and were followed in this instance. And Bellevue Hospital is specially designed for isolation, identification and treatment of Ebola patients. Every hospital in the city is prepared in the event that other patients come forward.\u201d\n\nA few weeks later, the patient, Dr. Craig Spencer, left Bellevue a cured man.\n\nIn retrospect, New York City\u2019s response was a critical turning point in the global crisis. At a time of collective high anxiety, the value of New York City\u2019s public hospital system proved to be priceless.\n\nYet, barely sixteen months later, that same public hospital system \u2013 formerly known as the Health and Hospitals Corporation and now re-branded as NYC Health + Hospitals \u2013 is facing perhaps the greatest financial crisis of its existence.\n\nFormed in 1969, the city\u2019s municipal hospital system for decades has provided the kind of universal health care in the real world that still remains an aspirational talking point in our national politics. In New York City no one is turned away, and unlike at other hospitals the city\u2019s public hospitals don\u2019t have the cost saving option of just stabilizing the seriously ill patients and transferring them out to some other facility. They keep patients until they\u2019re well.\n\n\u201cWith the city\u2019s system the mission is that everyone has a right to health care no matter who you are, what ZIP code you come from, or even your immigration status,\u201d said Kevin Collins, the executive director of the Doctors Council, an SEIU affiliate that represents the 2,500 doctors and dentists who staff the city\u2019s 11 acute care hospitals and dozens of outpatient facilities and clinic sites across the five boroughs.\n\nHowever, New York City\u2019s medical safety net model is now facing a tidal wave of red ink that\u2019s projected to grow exponentially. From 2008 to 2014, HHC was losing more than half a billion dollars annually.\n\nAccording to a city filing on September 2015 with the state Financial Control Board, the municipal hospital system\u2019s yearly operating losses are projected to double from $984 million in 2016 to $1.83 billion by 2019. When you add in debt service the numbers are even more dire, with a $1.1 billion loss in 2016 jumping to a $1.95 billion shortfall in 2019.\n\nThe trend lines show a system with declining revenue, even as costs continue to spike.\n\nIn March of 2014 the city\u2019s Independent Budget Office listed the system\u2019s challenges: repeated state and federal cuts, decreased patient utilization of the system\u2019s facilities, a patient base heavily weighted toward the indigent, the uninsured and those on Medicaid, and \u201cstubbornly high labor costs.\u201d\n\nThe city\u2019s municipal hospital system does not operate in a void. For decades, national efforts at health care cost containment and advances in medicine combined to reduce the need for hospital beds as the nation shifted to outpatient services and one-day procedures.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio hosts a press conference at Bellevue Hospital regarding the discharge of Ebola patient Dr. Craig Spencer.

Hardest hit were the big urban teaching hospitals and \u201csafety-net\u201d public hospitals that were providing medical care for the tens of millions of people who lack insurance and the swelling ranks of undocumented immigrants. In essence, these are the critical portals through which a potential Ebola risk could float, as it did, undetected.\n\nNowhere was this battle over which hospitals should be declared an unnecessary \u201csurplus\u201d more bitter than in New York City. The process of \u201cright-sizing\u201d the number of hospital beds in a community has been fraught with bitter politics that often pitted constituencies against one another.\n\nAll too often, community activists found themselves unable to counter health care systems and real estate developers who saw selling off of a hospital campus as a \u201cwin-win.\u201d Advocates warned that if keeping a local hospital open was purely decided on short-term economics, historically poor and disadvantaged neighborhoods of color, already dealing with the legacy of health care disparities, would lose even more ground.\n\nSince 2003, 16 hospitals in New York City have closed.\n\nAs public advocate and a candidate for mayor, de Blasio was arrested in a high-profile protest of the closure of Brooklyn\u2019s Long Island College Hospital, which was founded in 1858. Although de Blasio went on to win the mayoralty, the hospital was ultimately closed in 2014.\n\nThe stage was set for the New York City municipal hospital system\u2019s latest and most daunting crisis in 2010 and 2011. After years of inaction in Washington, D.C., and Albany, the election of President Barack Obama in 2008 and of Cuomo in 2010 would bring seismic changes in health care.\n\nObama\u2019s landmark Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, passed in March 2010, aimed to reduce the number of uninsured Americans, but it also expressly prohibited the participation of millions of America\u2019s undocumented residents. In addition, the landmark legislation promised reductions in federal support for safety net hospitals, like New York City\u2019s public hospitals, for charity care. The logic was those indigent care costs should be ratcheted down as the number of uninsured declined.\n\nIn 2011, just a few months after being elected, Cuomo appointed a Medicaid Redesign Team with a mandate to rein in the state\u2019s escalating Medicaid spending while improving the quality of the care.\n\nThe stakes were high. The state was spending $50 billion a year on Medicaid. For a majority of the state\u2019s 62 counties, the cost of Medicaid was half of their annual tax levy, with no relief in sight. New York state spent more than twice the national average on Medicaid on a per capita basis. Its spending per participant was the second highest in the nation, and for all that spending it ranked only 21st in the overall quality of the health care system. The Empire State ranked last among all states when it came to avoidable hospitalizations.\n\nBy June 2015, Cuomo was able to report that under the Affordable Care Act, 500,000 state residents had signed up for Medicaid. At the same time, overall Medicaid spending had \u201csignificantly slowed\u201d to just 1.4 percent annually since 2011, as compared to the 4.3 percent hike in costs the state averaged between 2003 and 2010.\n\nThanks to a 2014 deal Cuomo cut with federal Medicaid regulators, the state would make a crucial shift from a fee-for-service model of hospital compensation to a value performance system. This pivot would reward reductions in emergency room visits, reduce hospitalizations and produce better health outcomes. Under the terms of the pact, New York would be entitled to invest $7.3 billion of the resulting savings back into improving its overall health care system.\n\n\u201cThere are many shifts in NYC Health + Hospitals\u2019 traditional revenue and expenses going on right now because of policy changes on the federal, state and local levels, as well as changes in the health care landscape,\u201d said Erin Kelly, a health budget and policy analyst with the city\u2019s Independent Budget Office. \u201cIf NYC Health + Hospitals is definitely at a moment where they need to decide how to respond to these changes and what their strategy is moving forward, they\u2019re certainly not alone in this, as many people are wondering where safety net providers fit in a post-ACA, managed care and highly consolidated health care landscape.\u201d\n\nRaju, NYC Health + Hospitals\u2019 president and CEO, is confident that the hospital system that successfully beat Ebola can navigate the challenging road ahead. Despite the two tracks of reform coming from Washington and Albany, he said, major reforms are needed in both how care is delivered and how it is paid for.\n\n\u201cThe delivery of care in this country has for too many years been purely a physician driven system,\u201d Raju said at the system\u2019s executive offices on Worth Street in Lower Manhattan. \u201cNow we need to be given care by a care coordinator, social worker, nurses, physician\u2019s assistant and nurse practitioners.\u201d\n\nRaju said the only way for the city\u2019s system to get into the black is to increase its market share by improving the level of patient satisfaction and turning patients \u201cinto our ambassadors,\u201d promoting the system by word of mouth.\n\nRaju is banking on the expansion of the municipal system\u2019s MetroPlus health insurance plan from its current half a million subscribers to one million in five years. To be competitive in a marketplace increasingly driven by patient choice, Raju said the city\u2019s health care system must be easily accessible both physically and culturally.\n\nBut while Raju hailed the passage of the Affordable Care Act, he acknowledged that it does have gaps, such as not extending coverage to undocumented immigrants, a big part of the patient base of New York City\u2019s public system. By some estimates there are about half a million undocumented New Yorkers, and roughly half of them are uninsured. According to Raju, excluding the undocumented from coverage is a mistake.\n\nNYC Health + Hospitals\u2019 edge in the battle for patients is the diversity of its 38,000-plus employees, Raju said. \u2018\u2019We have one great advantage: You can come from anywhere in the world, and you can come in and I\u2019ll be able to find you somebody from your part of the world who speaks your language and looks like you.\u201d\n\nCollins, the executive director of the SEIU Doctors Council, said his workforce is very much engaged in improving the patient experience in working with the system\u2019s management and the broader community.\n\nThrough what Collins calls collaborative councils, the medical professionals he represents in New York City are empowered to have a meaningful role in the decision-making about how best to improve patient care. \u201cYou improve the patient experience through the engagement of front-line doctors who are not just being told what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Collins told City & State.\n\nEven in a best-case scenario, achieving Raju\u2019s goals is still a few years off. It's not clear, based on just how much red ink there is on the system\u2019s books, how much time he really has.\n\nIn his State of the City address, de Blasio called for a $337 million cash infusion into the city's financially strapped municipal hospitals. At a press conference, de Blasio committed to releasing his own strategy that would \u201cfigure out long-term financial stability and viability\u201d for the city system.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s premature to start to outline it until it\u2019s all done, but it\u2019s going to have to put Health + Hospitals on a strong footing for years and years to come in a substantially changed health care environment,\u201d de Blasio told reporters.\n\n\u201cAnd we now know many good things came out of the changes at the federal and state level \u2013 I want to be very clear, a lot of good came out of Obamacare, a lot of good came out of the Medicaid reforms, but some real unintended consequences, too,\u201d the mayor continued. \u201cWe now have that picture and we\u2019re going to have to adjust for a very different future.\u201d\n\nRight now, the short-term fiscal future of the city\u2019s hospital system, the largest in the country, is at best murky. It\u2019s likely the mayor\u2019s plan for ensuring the long-term sustainability of the city\u2019s hospital system will come out later this spring around the time of his proposed budget.\n\nNo doubt, this is a heavy lift that the city can\u2019t do alone. State officials play a key role in terms of hospital funding, and Cuomo\u2019s initial budget, released in January, only increased concerns inside City Hall. The governor's budget appeared to shift to the city Medicaid costs historically borne by the state, to the tune of a $1 billion by 2020.\n\nIn public statements since, Cuomo has said his budget is only aiming at efficiencies, not actual cuts. \u201cIt won't cost New York City a penny,\" Cuomo insisted.\n\nCuomo and the state Legislature have until their April 1 budget deadline to frame a final budget, at which time the de Blasio administration will know just how much of a partner they have in Albany.", "article_metadata": {"description": "City&State, the only media company solely devoted to government and politics in New York, provides insightful coverage of the state's politics, policies and people.", "author": "Bob Hennelly", "og": {"image": "http://cityandstateny.com/assets/image-cache/_img/cityandstate-og2.jpg", "title": "New York City\u2019s public hospitals face funding crisis"}, "sailthru.date": "Mar 02, 2016", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "keywords": "Policy,New York City,Healthcare", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "At a time of collective high anxiety, the value of New York City\u2019s public hospital system proved to be priceless.\nIn addition, the landmark legislation promised reductions in federal support for safety net hospitals, like New York City\u2019s public hospitals, for charity care.\nIn retrospect, New York City\u2019s response was a critical turning point in the global crisis.\nHowever, New York City\u2019s medical safety net model is now facing a tidal wave of red ink that\u2019s projected to grow exponentially.\nYet, barely sixteen months later, that same public hospital system \u2013 formerly known as the Health and Hospitals Corporation and now re-branded as NYC Health + Hospitals \u2013 is facing perhaps the greatest financial crisis of its existence."}
