Matt Bevin (Photo: Matt Stone/The Courier-Journal)Buy Photo\n\nFRANKFORT, Ky. \u2013 The first plank of the platform that Matt Bevin released as a longshot candidate for governor early this year is labeled: \u201cRight to Work. Enacting Pro-Business Legislation.\u201d\n\nSo as the Republican governor settles into office \u2013 with a shrinking Democratic majority in the Kentucky House \u2013 the outlook is better for passage of the so-called right-to-work bill that would ban union membership or payment of union dues as a condition for employment.\n\nBut some key legislators on both sides of the aisle say it\u2019s no sure bet to pass in the 2016 session.\n\nThe outlook is similar for another bill long sought by business \u2013 and long opposed by organized labor \u2013 that would weaken the law requiring a regional prevailing wage rate be paid to workers on government construction jobs.\n\n\u201cThe numbers are closer, but as they stand today, they\u2019re not close enough to pass right-to-work,\u201d said Senate Republican Leader Damon Thayer, of Georgetown. \u201cFrankly, we need to not only take the majority in the House, but we need a very solid majority to pass some of these priority bills that we have been pushing in the Senate.\u201d\n\nThe new Republican governor and growing Republican numbers in the legislature do, however, seem to make it certain that the Democratic priority of raising the minimum wage will again be blocked. Bevin showed on Dec. 22 exactly how much he opposes raising the minimum wage when he reversed former Gov. Steve Beshear's order raising the minimum wage for state workers, calling it \"regulatory overreach.\"\n\nBevin's priority is right-to-work. His platform argued that requiring workers covered by a collective bargaining agreement to pay union dues discourages businesses from locating in Kentucky and is unfair to workers.\n\n\u201cRight To Work legislation would help make Kentucky a more attractive place for new businesses. Not doing so puts us at a disadvantage to bordering states such as Indiana, Tennessee, Virginia and the other states in our region,\" his platform said.\n\nIn recent years, right-to-work bills have sailed out of the Republican Senate, then stalled in the House Labor and Industry Committee controlled by Democrats. In 2015, the bill was given priority designation as Senate Bill 1 and passed the Senate during the session\u2019s first week by a 24-12 vote.\n\nRep. Joni Jenkins, D-Shively, expects the same thing will happen in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe overwhelming majority of the caucus opposes it,\" Jenkins said. \"And there are a handful of pro-labor Republicans, probably five to seven, who would vote with the Democrats on that issue.\u201d\n\nOne Republican senator, C.B. Embry Jr., of Morgantown, voted against right-to-work last year.\n\nJenkins said states that have enacted right-to-work see wages decline.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a negative to the very folks that send us to Frankfort, the folks that get up and work every day,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we have a really good business climate in Kentucky. I wonder why Matt Bevin chose to move to Kentucky if he thinks we have such a bad business climate here. Over and over we\u2019ve been named as one of the most business-friendly states.\u201d\n\nBill Londrigan, president of the Kentucky State AFL-CIO, said, \u201cWorkforce education and training, geographic location and economic development incentives are the main factors for locating an economic development project. ... The governor just announced a new foundry in Simpson County with more than 300 jobs. ... And the automobile industry wouldn\u2019t be investing billions here in Kentucky if this was such a big deal.\u201d\n\nBut Dave Adkisson, chief executive of the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, said Kentucky can do better.\n\n\u201cMany business people use it as a litmus test for whether a state is business-friendly,\" he said. \"We\u2019re convinced that there are major companies that will not even consider Kentucky for a location because we are not right-to-work. We\u2019re convinced we\u2019re losing several thousand jobs per year by not having that designation.\u201d\n\nThe chamber also backs repealing prevailing wage. If opponents can\u2019t repeal the law, supporters of repeal hope to take a smaller step like exempting school projects from the law or raising the level at which the law applies \u2013 currently projects costing more than $250,000 \u2013 to a higher dollar amount.\n\n\u201cGovernment should not be in the business of setting wages,\" Thayer said. \"That should be done by the marketplace. All prevailing wage does is inflate the cost to the taxpayers.\u201d\n\nBut Jenkins said, \u201cIf you raise wages of lower income folks, the money stays in local communities, they support local businesses there. I think it\u2019s a win for everybody \u2026 Paying for professional workers that have traditionally in Kentucky given us good products just makes a lot of sense to me.\u201d\n\nLondrigan said, \u201cLook at the new Louisville bridge, built on time, on budget, by a skilled, reliable workforce. It\u2019s a testament to what prevailing wage does.\u201d\n\nAnd although the outlook for a minimum wage increase is worse than last year, when the Republican Senate blocked it, Democrats say they will push again for phasing in an increase from $7.25 to $10.10 per hour.\n\n\u201cI think it will still be a high priority in the Democratic caucus,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cI expect the House will pass it, and it will go over to the Senate and see no action. I wish we could have a more open discussion about it.\"\n\nLondrigan said, \u201cEverything we know about raising the minimum wage is beneficial. People make more money, they spend more money, they\u2019ve got more money to help the economy. \u2026 I expect the House will move it again to see what the Senate does with it. The polling shows it\u2019s supported by the vast majority of Kentuckians.\u201d\n\nBut Thayer said the bill has no chance to pass the Senate. \u201cWhen you require a statewide minimum wage you drive up the cost of doing business for business owners. That costs jobs, it hurts employees, and drives up the cost to consumers.\u201d\n\nBevin said in his executive order rolling back the higher minimum wage for state workers that \"the minimum wage stifles job creation and disproportionately impacts lower skilled workers seeking entry level jobs.\"\n\nReporter Tom Loftus can be reached at (502) 875-5136 or tloftus@courier-journal.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1YEhSvQ", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Despite Matt Bevin's support, both Democrats and Republicans say it's passage is uncertain", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Despite Matt Bevin's support, both Democrats and Republicans say it's passage is uncertain", "title": "Right-to-work no sure bet in Ky. legislature", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/ky-legislature/2015/12/24/right--work-no-sure-bet-ky-legislature/77833216/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Despite Matt Bevin's support, both Democrats and Republicans say it's passage is uncertain", "title": "Right-to-work no sure bet in Ky. legislature", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7a3938fb4fa9c53e02314370238841abf0d7abd2/c=468-0-2489-2021&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/12/10/Louisville/Louisville/635853567370501176-MattBevinCapitol.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/Schools", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Places/Schools", "title": "Right-to-work no sure bet in Ky. legislature", "author": "Tom Loftus", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/politics/ky-legislature", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/10dfe0160f8750e62a7d7ed9e0b5dc2187913388/c=721-0-2237-2021/local/-/media/2015/12/10/Louisville/Louisville/635853567370501176-MattBevinCapitol.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/73bf5844d0b0694d15bd8cf8a02c611eecb00e67/c=468-0-2489-2021/local/-/media/2015/12/10/Louisville/Louisville/635853567370501176-MattBevinCapitol.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9a470ac95d996b414f590adb8c482a32fdb9a191/c=135-0-2823-2021/local/-/media/2015/12/10/Louisville/Louisville/635853567370501176-MattBevinCapitol.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d3f0a4d7c6e1efaade2cc0e581b5a032d49fe724/c=0-66-2957-1737&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/12/10/Louisville/Louisville/635853567370501176-MattBevinCapitol.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-12-24T12:57:46.430000-05:00", "shorthed": "Right-to-work no sure bet in Ky. legislature", "articleid": 77833216, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ca7b0a66e9f55009229a4c4e44b6f98fa8b8f994/c=0-66-2957-1737/local/-/media/2015/12/10/Louisville/Louisville/635853567370501176-MattBevinCapitol.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ec248ed8cd4c2a068cbf7a393037680c552273e3/c=913-0-2045-2021/local/-/media/2015/12/10/Louisville/Louisville/635853567370501176-MattBevinCapitol.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Right to work, labor, Kentucky, business, Matt Bevin, prevailing wage, minimum wage, Ky"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe numbers are closer, but as they stand today, they\u2019re not close enough to pass right-to-work,\u201d said Senate Republican Leader Damon Thayer, of Georgetown.\nBevin showed on Dec. 22 exactly how much he opposes raising the minimum wage when he reversed former Gov.\n\u201cWhen you require a statewide minimum wage you drive up the cost of doing business for business owners.\nIn recent years, right-to-work bills have sailed out of the Republican Senate, then stalled in the House Labor and Industry Committee controlled by Democrats.\nBut some key legislators on both sides of the aisle say it\u2019s no sure bet to pass in the 2016 session."}
