While we don\u2019t know exactly how many people have made it all the way to the finish line, it\u2019s clear plenty are still stuck. As part of KERA\u2019s series Obamacare 101: Making The Choice, we profile of a Fort Worth woman who\u2019s been uninsured for more than a decade.\n\nThe KERA radio story.\n\nThere are dozens of eighteen wheelers at the truck stop off I-35-W in Keller. But spotting Connie Puckett is easy.\n\nShe\u2019s the one with dreads and a doggie t-shirt standing next to a truck specially outfitted for pet grooming. Puckett not only bathes and combs, she\u2019s pretty much the vet.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s very little that I can\u2019t handle when it comes to the dogs,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I really kind of apply that philosophy, or at least I have up until this point, to myself as well.\u201d\n\nAt 49, though, she says the health care self-service station isn\u2019t as effective as it used to be.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019ve got a problem with my heart,\u201d Puckett says. \u201cThat was the wake-up call for me.\u201d\n\nUninsured And Out Of Luck\n\nWhen Puckett felt her heart pounding irregularly in 2010, she tried to ignore it.\n\n\u201cI really should have gone to the emergency room,\u201d Puckett says. \u201cBut I\u2019m tired of using the emergency room as my primary care physician.\u201d\n\nHer doctor, who lets her pay in cash, said she needed to see a specialist. She started saving up and calling around.\n\n\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t have insurance,\u201d she says, \u201cI could not even get an appointment.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s where Obamacare comes in.\n\nOptions On The Health Insurance Marketplace\n\nLong before the Health Insurance Marketplace opened on Oct. 1, Puckett was paying close attention to Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really the type of person that falls through the cracks,\u201d Puckett says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m not willing to pay, its just that on a month to month basis, when the basic cost is more than my mortgage\u2026the option I have is to pay my mortgage or get health care?\u201d\n\nSo, as soon as the Marketplace opened, Puckett has been online trying to buy insurance. She\u2019s finally managed to log in and create an account, but hasn\u2019t been able to actually shop. Puckett says she doesn\u2019t expect the plans to be perfect. She just needs something affordable to help get her foot in the door to see a cardiologist, then she can get back to work shampooing Ted.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "aca,affordable care act,health,health insurance marketplace,making the choice,obamacare,obamacare 101", "og": {"image": "http://breakthroughs.kera.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/image_4-e1382034331570.jpeg", "type": "website"}, "description": "It\u2019s been three weeks since the health insurance marketplace opened in Texas.
