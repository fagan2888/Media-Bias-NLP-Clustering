An estimated 246 million people - around five percent of those aged 15 to 64 - used an illicit drug in 2013, and some 27 million people have drug problems, according to the UNODC.\n\n(Reporting By Kieran Guilbert, Editing by Timothy Pearce; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, corruption and climate change.
