It was of a bulbously double-chinned Chris Christie, purporting to quote him from an appearance on CNN in which he said: \u201cIf I am elected president I will go after marijuana smokers and the states that allow them to smoke. I\u2019ll shut them down big time. I\u2019m sick of these addicts, sick of these liberals with no self-control.\u201d\n\nOnly Christie never said those words \u2014 and certainly not on CNN.\n\nIn a call-in right-wing radio show hosted by Hugh Hewitt, Christie said, \u201cWe have an enormous addiction problem,\u201d and that \u201cthe states should not be permitted to sell it.\u201d Nothing about liberals. Nothing about self-control. Those were lies.\n\nI pointed out to my friend that this was not an actual quote by Chris Christie. His response: \u201cHe says stuff like that all the time.\u201d\n\nA few weeks later, I saw another photo meme on a different friend\u2019s Facebook page. This was of Louis Gohmert, perhaps the least qualified person ever to sit in Congress and decide laws since he\u2019s far too stupid to even read them and understand what they mean. The man really should be sent to remedial kindergarten and not the Congress. Anyhoo. This meme quoted Gohmert as saying he \u201cthinks a lot about gay sex.\u201d He then went on to make a typically dumb statement about how, if left on a desert island for 100 years, gays would die out since they don\u2019t reproduce. Did Gohmert make bigoted, ill-informed statements about gay sex? Absolutely. Did he say any of the words quoted in that meme? Not a chance. But it didn\u2019t matter to that friend, either. It was, in his view, \u201cclose enough.\u201d\n\nAnd here in lies my major quibble with the quality of political discourse as we now practice it in America: It is not, in fact, a discourse. It is instead position-taking based upon faulty, misleading and outright untruthful information.\n\nThis is not news to followers of politics. Not at all. Sarah Palin invented \u2014 through her own social media platforms \u2014 the entire concept and phrase about \u201cObamacare death panels,\u201d which never existed in any form, but became a part of the political discussion. Fair-minded progressives would point out that this was made up, though unfair and imbalanced FOXNews wouldn\u2019t hear of it, and repeated the myth as if it where\u2019s Obama\u2019s main doctrine, a plan by the Kenyan-born Muslim communist at eugenics. It\u2019s been five years, and \u201cdeath panels\u201d still lingers in the public consciousness. And Liberal Democrats still pull out their remaining hair to rage against the political machine about misinformation, disinformation and lies that pervert the process.\n\nAnd then they turn around and do the same thing.\n\nThere is an old, trusty adage that one must \u201cfight fire with fire.\u201d I bet sure most firefighters would tell you that water and sand usually do a better job, but let\u2019s forget about that for a second. Democrats have never been at a loss for having their own ways of phrasing and crafting a message to highlight their opponents\u2019 weaknesses, to minimize their own, and to steel the positives in their message. Excoriating the enemy with clever linguistic tricks and rhetoric is time-honored. Frankly, it\u2019s what we writers frequently do.\n\nBut I\u2019m not talking here about characterizing one\u2019s position as extreme and another\u2019s as moderate, or shining the best light on one\u2019s own ideas. I\u2019m talking about lying about quotes and acting like the lie is justified. I am talking about propagating known falsehoods about another candidate, another party, an opposition group, and twisting it beyond recognition while pretending it is fact. Pardon my na\u00efvet\u00e9, but I thought progressives were better than that.\n\nI foolishly thought that when I pointed out the errors of these memes to my friends, they would quickly disavow them if not take them down right away. But no: They embraced the now common, Trumpian practice of doubling down. They cleaved to the errors and defending them as, I suppose, speaking to a \u201chigher truth.\u201d Of course, the higher truth that they refer to is likewise based upon these mistaken premises. When your entire dialogue is merely a catalog of falsehoods about your opponents, at what point does the reality settle in and mean something to you? When we put up a photo of Chris Christie and quotation marks around words that we attribute to him, on specific dates and in specific media, knowing that\u2019s wrong, we haven\u2019t won any battles, we\u2019ve merely contributed to the dumbing down, the name-calling, the schoolyard taunting quality of American politics.\n\nIt would not be difficult to find reams of direct quotes from Chris Christie that would hoist him with his own petard. Likewise Louis Gohmert, who is a hardworking factory of lies. You want grist for your political hate mail? The facts are out there. Let\u2019s take them to task on the facts. But when we just pander to our own feelings and desires and what we want to believe, we can\u2019t then attack the other side for doing the same.\n\nWhen we present opinions under quotation marks; when we rewrite history to suit our own needs; when we compromise our own values in order to score fleeting and hollow victories against perceived enemies, we are no better than the opponents. And then, when our opponents accuse us of lying and misrepresentation, we have to concede, \u201cYep. We did it. So what?\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s when we lose. It\u2019s when the American people lose. It\u2019s when the political system gets beyond the control of intelligent people wanting to be informed voters and falls to the hands of who has the loudest megaphone, the largest checkbook, the meanest barbs. Without a claim to moral or at least ethical superiority, we lose an important arrow in our quiver and distort the democratic process. It\u2019s difficult to criticize a system that doesn\u2019t represent the people\u2019s interest when the people aren\u2019t representing their own.\n\nNote: The person who posted the Chris Christie meme informs me that he later removed the post from his page.\n\nComments (powered by FaceBook)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Dallas Voice", "description": "When we present opinions under quotation marks; when we rewrite history to suit our own needs; when we compromise our own values in order to score fleeting and hollow victories against perceived enemies, we are no better than the opponents.
