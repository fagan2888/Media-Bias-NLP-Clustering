Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., launched the latest campaign in what he calls his ongoing war on waste.\n\nWith the timely title \u201cThe Farce Awakens,\u201d Flake\u2019s 2015 Wastebook highlights 100 government programs of questionable merit\u2014such as the millions in taxpayer dollars spent on sheep in microgravity, monkeys on treadmills, and hipsters at parties.\n\n\u201cThe message here is for those who claim we\u2019re in a period of budget austerity and that there\u2019s no fat left to cut,\u201d Flake told The Daily Signal. \u201cJust look in the book.\u201d\n\nFlake\u2019s Wastebook takes its name from the upcoming and eagerly anticipated seventh \u201cStar Wars\u201d film, \u201cThe Force Awakens.\u201d The 205-page publication chronicles examples that taxpayers may think range from the humorous to the preposterous.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health\u2019s \u201cHelp A Hipster\u201d program uses $5 million to throw dance parties to encourage youths to quit smoking and \u201ctake a stand against tobacco corporations.\u201d\n\nOne participant, the Wastebook notes, \u201cdid it for the money\u201d but says he \u201cknew I wasn\u2019t going to quit.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Agency for International Development spent $2 million promoting tourism in Lebanon, a nation the State Department has warned Americans to avoid because of the risk of terrorism.\n\nFlake\u2019s Wastebook cautions Americans \u201cto heed the warnings of the State Department rather than the urgings of the USAID and avoid vacationing in Lebanon at this time.\u201d\n\n>>> Commentary: Why Isn\u2019t There More Talk About Out-of-Control Spending?\n\nIn the book, available online, Flake writes that \u201cdespite the ballyhooing over budget austerity, the government didn\u2019t come up short on outlandish ways to waste money in 2015.\u201d\n\nSince their passage in the Budget Control Act of 2011, spending caps imposed by \u201csequestration\u201d have been a favorite target for Democrat frustration. President Obama and congressional Democrats have railed against the spending caps as too low.\n\nSequestration budget cuts in 2013 don\u2019t go nearly far enough, Flake told The Daily Signal. He said his office is \u201cjust scratching the surface of things we shouldn\u2019t be spending money on.\u201d\n\nThe Arizona Republicans blames much of the waste on the way Congress does business during the appropriations process. During those debates, Flake said, there\u2019s little room for fiscal conservatives to maneuver and cut frivolous spending. He said:\n\nWhen there\u2019s one big omnibus [spending bill], it is \u2018pass it or the government shuts down.\u2019 Those of us who are looking for spending discipline, we lose all our leverage.\n\nMany of the programs are there to \u201cjust grease the skids\u201d and enable future spending, Flake said. Once approved, he said, university programs tend to continue uninterrupted and without accountability for their budget.\n\n\u201cNow, with a lot of these programs, we\u2019ve authorized the spending,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we don\u2019t conduct serious oversight.\u201d\n\nRomina Boccia, a federal budget expert at The Heritage Foundation, hailed Flake\u2019s effort to pinpoint waste. Boccia said:\n\nFrom canceling tens of billions in duplicative spending to eliminating corporate subsidies, lawmakers can live up to their commitment to restrain spending. Now is the time to take a stance against the higher spending levels and single out bad government programs for cuts. This new Wastebook by Flake is one good place to start.\n\nThe pun-heavy publication is the most recent edition in Flake\u2019s anthology of profligate spending. In December of 2014, he released \u201cScience of Splurging\u201d and earlier this year \u201cJurassic Pork.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just try to find something topical and hitch the name to it to get it noticed,\u201d Flake said. \u201cThere\u2019s an endless sources of bad puns that can be made.\n\n\u201cThe good ones are mine. The bad ones are [from] staff.\u201d\n\nThis report has been updated to include the quote from Romina Boccia and to specify how the Budget Control Act works.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cWith a lot of these programs, we\u2019ve authorized the spending, but don\u2019t conduct serious oversight,\" Sen.
