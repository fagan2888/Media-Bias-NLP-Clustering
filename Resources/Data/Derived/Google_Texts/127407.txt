The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is certifying dozens of laboratories that are now authorized to test federal employees for drugs, the agency said Friday.

HHS's Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which certifies the drug-testing labs, announced a list of 31 facilities around the country and in Canada that are authorized to test federal workers for drugs. The agency vetted these labs to make sure they meet federal drug-testing guidelines.

Federal agencies must go through one of these certified labs to test their employees for drugs.

The labs take urine samples to test federal workers for drugs.

The list of approved drug-testing labs is updated each month.
