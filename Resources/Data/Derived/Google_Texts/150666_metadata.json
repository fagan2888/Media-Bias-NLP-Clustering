According to USA Today, signs of the cooperative\u2019s financial troubles didn\u2019t really come to public attention until October, when CoOportunity withdrew from a state program that uses federal Medicaid money to pay private insurance premiums for low-income Iowans. The official explanation for the takeover\u2014and the likely end of CoOportunity as a going concern\u2014was a lack of cash and assets, reportedly only $17 million despite the cooperative\u2019s 120,000 members in Iowa and Nebraska.\n\nMartin Hickey, the chairman of the National Alliance of State Health Co-ops, told the Omaha World-Herald that CoOportunity\u2019s problems were not shared by other health insurance cooperatives. As paraphrased by the World-Herald, Hickey indicated that CoOportunity was hurt because of its success in attracting members, implying that it signed up more members than it anticipated but was unable to could raise the capital assets to cover their needs. Because of \u201cextremely high healthcare utilization,\u201d CoOportunity reportedly lost $45.7 million in the first 10 months of 2014. Though it received \u201csolvency\u201d and operating funds from the federal government to deal with the high utilization issue, the feds ended solvency payments to CoOportunity and other nonprofit insurers in December. Facing further restrictions in access to operating funding due to changes in the federal spending bill approved last month, CoOportunity was stuck.\n\nCritics have jumped on the Iowa news to eviscerate nonprofits, cooperatives, and the Affordable Care Act. Investors Business Daily\u2019s headline was \u201cObamacare Co-op Hits Skids.\u201d Fox News headlined the CoOportunity Health issue as evidence of the continuing \u201cObamacare woes\u201d and quoted a nearly chortling Drew Klein, director of the Iowa chapter of Americans for Prosperity, who said, \u201cHere in Iowa, we were promised more [choices] and lower premiums, yet now we learn that one of two [companies] responsible for providing affordable insurance can\u2019t provide what the law promises.\u201d\n\nThough no fan of the Affordable Care Act, Tim Worstall weighed in in Forbes to proclaim this as evidence of the \u201cfailure of the cooperative model\u2026a certain romanticism about cooperatives.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re really not very suited to an industry that has large capital requirements,\u201d Worstall wrote, \u201cbecause neither the consumers (customers) or the workers, the people who, dependent upon flavor of co-op, own it, have much if any capital to put into a capital intensive business.\u201d\n\nIt might be useful to actually look at what actually happened with CoOportunity and determine to what extent its problems are indicative of a deeper issue with health insurance cooperatives in the Affordable Care Act or with cooperatives per se. In Iowa, other than CoOportunity, there was only one other health insurance provider offering insurance to Iowans through the Healthcare.gov exchange: Coventry Healthcare, owned by Aetna. Undoubtedly having tired of their treatment by the big health insurance companies, Iowans (and Nebraskans) flocked toward the consumer-run, nonprofit alternative with more fervor than CoOportunity\u2019s founders and managers ever expected. Add to that the restrictions that CoOportunity faced in its use of the capital loan it received at its outset from the federal government\u2014documented here, along with the efforts of the cooperatives to find resources and adopt strategies with more flexibility\u2014and the challenges of an undercapitalized, oversubscribed, completely new health insurer aren\u2019t difficult to imagine.\n\nWhile some of the nonprofit cooperatives have done spectacularly, particularly in Kentucky and Maine, others have had difficulties in maintaining required capital ratios. The federal government recently made \u201csolvency funding\u201d loans to a handful of health insurance cooperatives, including those in New York ($90.7 million), Wisconsin ($51.2 million), and Connecticut ($48.4 million), as well as to CoOportunity, serving Iowa and Nebraska ($32.7 million)\u2014and roughly $65 million apiece for the Kentucky Health Cooperative and Maine Community Health Options. Why would the successful CO-OPs in Kentucky and Maine, having captured over 80 percent of the sign-ups on those states\u2019 exchanges in the first year of the ACA, need solvency help? Because they are new entities, a year or two old, and trying to get to a steady state of financial performance and results. Remember, they are competing against huge behemoth private insurers that are many decades old, and the CO-OPs are not only new, but offering different and more responsive services to customers than their calcified competition.\n\nWorstall is correct about the capital generating limitations of cooperatives in capital-intensive industries such as healthcare, but he and many others miss the point about the nonprofit insurance CO-OPs. They weren\u2019t originally part of the Affordable Care Act; they were a last-minute deal concocted to placate centrist Democrats who wanted to see some sort of alternative to the big insurers offered but also to avoid ticking off conservative Republicans who were dead set against the \u201cpublic option\u201d\u2014that is, government-provided insurance. Despite CoOportunity\u2019s demise, the other nonprofit insurance cooperatives are braving the health sector\u2019s financial shoals to offer alternatives to the Coventry/Aetna offerings of the world, providing a competition yardstick that is compelling the big companies to suddenly rebrand themselves as less costly, simpler, and more straightforward in their offerings.\n\nNotwithstanding CoOportunity Health\u2019s troubles, these brand new nonprofit health insurance cooperatives in other states, like Kentucky\u2019s, run by the indomitable Janie Miller, might find their marks, survive, and stabilize during their first few years of operation and become viable business operations. But that doesn\u2019t obviate the real answer that, as retiring Iowa Senator Tom Harkin noted, President Obama and Congress failed to pursue during the first two years of the Obama administration\u2014that is, to have included the public option in the Affordable Care Act legislation when Obama and the Democrat \u201chad the votes.\u201d\u2014Rick Cohen", "article_metadata": {"description": "One of the new nonprofit health care cooperatives created under the ACA is in financial trouble\u2014oddly enough, because of its success at signing up unexpectedly large numbers of previously uninsured people.", "original-source": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2015/01/05/iowa-s-nonprofit-health-insurance-cooperative-taken-over-by-the-state/", "og": {"site_name": "Non Profit News For Nonprofit Organizations | Nonprofit Quarterly", "description": "One of the new nonprofit health care cooperatives created under the ACA is in financial trouble\u2014oddly enough, because of its success at signing up unexpectedly large numbers of previously uninsured people.", "title": "Iowa\u2019s Nonprofit Health Insurance Cooperative Taken Over by the State", "url": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2015/01/05/iowa-s-nonprofit-health-insurance-cooperative-taken-over-by-the-state/", "image": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/56/files/2015/01/Broken-Wall.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@npquarterly", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2015/01/05/iowa-s-nonprofit-health-insurance-cooperative-taken-over-by-the-state/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "News, Policy, Healthcare, Organizational Management and Change"}, "article_summary": "December 24, 2014; USA TodayJust before Christmas, the sad news of the struggles of Iowa\u2019s nonprofit health insurance cooperative\u2014CoOportunity Health\u2014led to the company\u2019s takeover by the state\u2019s health insurance division.\nMartin Hickey, the chairman of the National Alliance of State Health Co-ops, told the Omaha World-Herald that CoOportunity\u2019s problems were not shared by other health insurance cooperatives.\nIn Iowa, other than CoOportunity, there was only one other health insurance provider offering insurance to Iowans through the Healthcare.gov exchange: Coventry Healthcare, owned by Aetna.\nWhile some of the nonprofit cooperatives have done spectacularly, particularly in Kentucky and Maine, others have had difficulties in maintaining required capital ratios.\nUndoubtedly having tired of their treatment by the big health insurance companies, Iowans (and Nebraskans) flocked toward the consumer-run, nonprofit alternative with more fervor than CoOportunity\u2019s founders and managers ever expected."}
