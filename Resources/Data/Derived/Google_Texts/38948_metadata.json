It was a natural fit.\"\n\nGilfillan is No. 1 on Modern Healthcare's ranking of the 50 Most Influential Physician Executives and Leaders. It's the second time he has topped the list. Modern Healthcare is a sister publication of Crain's Detroit Business.\n\nWilliam Conway, CEO of Henry Ford Medical Group and executive vice president and chief quality officer of Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, was ranked No. 42.\n\nAs the Innovation Center's first leader, Gilfillan was instrumental in ushering in new payment and delivery models, such as Medicare accountable care organizations and bundled payments. He set the tone for new programs that coordinate care for enrolled patient populations seeking to reduce costs while improving patient outcomes and satisfaction.\n\nAfter three years at the helm, Gilfillan shifted to the provider side, taking the reins in October at the newly merged CHE Trinity Health. That merger brought together more than 80 hospitals from the former Catholic Health East and former Trinity Health in a deal that closed last May.\n\nThe system had started laying the groundwork for managing the health of enrolled populations before Gilfillan's arrival. But under his leadership, it is accelerating those efforts in each of its markets.\n\nCHE Trinity is aiming to reinvent how it cares for its patients. Among Gilfillan's goals is to have a Medicare Shared Savings Program accountable care organization in each of the system's markets by Jan. 1. It currently has five ACOs that have been approved and implemented, with 11 more applications in process for January.\n\nAn ACO is a network of doctors and hospitals that shares financial and medical responsibility for providing coordinated care to patients through a primary care physician, in hopes of limiting unnecessary spending.\n\nCHE Trinity also is extending its population health program to cover its 87,000 employees in its self-insured health benefit plan and is building similar value-based programs, including bundled-payment models with private insurers, to serve other patients.\n\nA hospital newcomer\n\nAlthough he's new to hospital operations, Gilfillan brings insurance expertise that could help CHE Trinity expand its ACOs, launch the health program for its 87,000 employees and begin accepting bundled payments.\n\nBundled payments are reimbursement for \"episodes of care,\" defined as the clinically related services a patient needs for a specific diagnostic condition, from the first symptom until treatment is complete.\n\nCHE Trinity has set a three-year objective to achieve $300 million in savings through merger cost efficiencies, with a goal of $80 million in the first year -- a target it already has surpassed. \"We're well ahead of that at this time,\" Gilfillan said.\n\nThe system's changes in care delivery are occurring as CHE Trinity engages in the tough job of integrating its two legacy systems, said Kevin Holloran, an analyst at Standard & Poor's who covers not-for-profit health systems. That includes melding cultures while achieving economies of scale.\n\nIn October, S&P lowered the long-term and underlying rating on the stronger Trinity Health bonds while raising the rating for Catholic Health East debt so that both organizations share the same credit rating. Moody's Investors Service made a similar move. The ratings agencies will be watching to see how the two former systems execute their megamerger and what the new system's projected capital expenditures look like as it carries out ambitious expansion plans.\n\nSome observers were surprised that CHE Trinity didn't select someone from its inner circle to lead the system.\n\n\"An organization the size of CHE Trinity often has massive bench strength, and it's kind of unusual that they would go outside the organization,\" Holloran said. But the appointment of an outsider to the top post could be a sign that the board wanted to create a new system that's more than the sum of its parts.\n\n\"Perhaps that sends a message to everyone that \"we're not CHE, we're not Trinity Health,' \" Holloran said.\n\nRoots in family medicine\n\nGilfillan earned his medical and undergraduate degrees at Georgetown University and started his career as a family physician at the Georgetown University Community Health Plan. He later moved to Massachusetts, where he helped found a community health center and family medicine practice. His first position on the insurance side was as medical director for Medigroup Central HMO, a Blue Cross of New Jersey managed-care plan.\n\nGilfillan was thinking about value-based models when he was in medical school in the 1970s, talking about health maintenance organizations and the \"triple aim\" goals of better patient experience, improved population health and reduced costs.\n\n\"I went into health care because I was always interested in figuring out how to get great health care to people,\" he said.\n\nWhile Gilfillan is new to hospital operations, he brings expertise that the system didn't have before, said Rick O'Connell, executive vice president of CHE Trinity Health and president of the Trinity Health division. Before the Baltimore-based CMS, Gilfillan was CEO of Danville, Pa.-based Geisinger Health Plan and executive vice president of insurance operations for Geisinger Health System. Earlier in his career, he was senior vice president for national network management at Coventry Health Care and also held positions at Independence Blue Cross.\n\n\"We're getting someone with a whole new set of eyes,\" O'Connell said. \"He came from the payer side, so his ability to understand how payers think has been a gift in and of itself.\"\n\n\"The acceleration we need'\n\nTrinity Health had been setting up clinically integrated networks in its markets before the merger. It's now building relationships with insurers, O'Connell said. Gilfillan's arrival has \"given us the acceleration we need to move forward in that direction.\"\n\nSome skeptics question the overall prospects for success of ACO-type population health management, noting that the first years of the Medicare ACO program have shown mixed results.\n\nThey also point out that many hospitals and physician groups did not do well financially in managing enrolled patient groups under HMO capitated (meaning the medical provider is given a set fee per patient regardless of the treatment required) payment in the 1990s and that those efforts triggered a backlash over restricted access to care.\n\nBut Gilfillan said the Medicare ACO programs and CHE Trinity's population health management initiatives are different from those earlier efforts because of the greater emphasis on measuring and optimizing the patient experience.\n\n\"I think everyone realized that we needed to start from the perspective of the patient,\" he said.\n\nFormer CMS administrator Don Berwick, M.D., said he recruited Gilfillan to the Innovation Center because he respected the work he did at Geisinger Health Plan.\n\nAt the Innovation Center, \"Dr. Gilfillan had the job of establishing a brand new organization in a highly controversial political environment,\" said Berwick, currently running for the Democratic nomination for Massachusetts governor. \"... He was elegant and very resilient in dealing with these potentially very demanding influences.\"\n\nGilfillan developed the ACO program and the bundled-payment initiatives. He also recruited the people to lead the different Innovation Center programs. The office space he designed for the Innovation Center was an open floor plan, with low partitions between work areas to encourage interaction.\n\n\"Rick was always driven by a vision he called \"true north,' where incentives for providers are aligned with the outcomes we want to see -- higher-quality and lower-cost care,\" said William Shrank, M.D., who was the Innovation Center's director of research and rapid-cycle evaluation and is now chief scientific officer and chief medical officer at CVS Caremark Corp.\n\n\"His clarity of purpose stimulated the Innovation Center to launch a wide array of new payment models. I think they all have Rick's fingerprints as we move away from rewarding volume and toward rewarding value in the delivery of health care.\"\n\nNearly four years later, Gilfillan's key programs face growing pains. Many provider networks that participated in the Medicare Shared Savings and Pioneer ACO programs failed to achieve savings. In the Pioneer program, nine of the 32 original participants dropped out after the first year. Of the 23 remaining providers, only nine saved money.\n\nGilfillan acknowledged that providers want more clarity on how the transformation to accountable care should work. The challenge includes having to work simultaneously under both value-based payment and fee-for-service, with conflicting incentives. That may slow the shift to the new model.\n\n\"I think there continues to be uncertainty around timing and direction,\" Gilfillan said.\n\nStill, insurers and providers are moving rapidly to risk-bearing payment models, and organizations that don't adapt will be left behind, S&P's Holloran said.\n\nOnce the Affordable Care Act was passed, he said, \"it was a symbol that the stars and the moon and sun are actually aligned. As an industry, everyone knows we can do better.\"\n\nBerwick said that bundled and capitated payment models are challenging old habits for health care industry leaders and that Gilfillan is well-positioned to show others the way forward.\n\n\"We're still in a very important era of expedition,\" Berwick said. \"It's not an easy one. I think Dr. Gilfillan represents the new model of clinical leadership and organizational leadership for change.\"\n\nFrom Modern Healthcare", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "When Richard Gilfillan, M.D., unexpectedly left his post as director of the\u00a0Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u00a0Innovation Center last June, health care leaders feared that his departure would slow the shift to a health care model that emphasizes value over volume.
