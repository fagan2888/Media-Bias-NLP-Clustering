He\u2019s ignored the pleas of Native American tribes. He\u2019s ignored President Obama and Post columnists Charles Krauthammer and Mike Wise . When protesters showed up in Minneapolis at the Redskins-Vikings game in early November, he ignored them, too.\n\nAfter years of ineffective rallies, op-eds, lawsuits, House bills and D.C. Council hearings about this controversy, one remedy remains for those who want Snyder to change his mind:\n\nPay him off.\n\nIn an October letter to fans, Snyder waxed eloquent about what the team means to him: \u201cI still remember my first Redskins game. . . . I was only six, but I remember coming through the tunnel into the stands at RFK with my father, and immediately being struck by the enormity of the stadium and the passion of the fans all around me.\u201d\n\nIf Snyder wants to play sentimental, he can go ahead. But he\u2019s not running a national park. He is running a business that happens to be the NFL\u2019s third-most-profitable franchise. And as a good businessman, he\u2019d respond to financial incentives to change his brand.\n\nThe bill wouldn\u2019t be small. Forbes magazine valued the Redskins, who earned $381 million in 2012, at $1.7 billion in August. National NFL merchandising is worth $3 billion per year, split evenly between the league\u2019s 32 teams, save the Dallas Cowboys, who have their own deal. The Redskins\u2019 annual share of this pot is about $100 million.\n\nSo, how much of the value of the team is tied up in tomahawks and headdresses?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that if they would change the Coca-Cola brand name, it would be a serious problem for the brand,\u201d said David Haigh, founder of Brand Finance, a brand-valuation company hired by big names such as Shell, Heineken and Vodafone. \u201cEvery brand is different. The Redskins have a football stadium, a franchise and a team that people come to watch. That\u2019s not going to change if you change the name.\u201d\n\nChanging the name could be more profitable than keeping it. If the Redskins backlash grows, removing merchandise with the R-word from circulation could mean more sales of team gear, not less, as customers embrace a new nickname and shell out for rebranded jerseys, T-shirts, coffee mugs and banners. (Snyder could even continue to sell Redskins merch, just as the Washington Wizards sell Bullets gear despite late owner Abe Pollin\u2019s principled stand against the name.)\n\nAnd whether the team becomes the Skins, as Krauthammer suggested, or the Red Clouds or the Pigskins , it will remain valuable because it plays in the nation\u2019s capital, one of the wealthiest metro regions in America.\n\n\u201cThey clearly have an extremely loyal fanbase willing to act as a permanent ATM,\u201d said Patrick Hruby, a former reporter for ESPN.com who\u2019s written about the Redskins brand for his blog Sports on Earth. \u201cI\u2019ve lived here for 20 years, and I find it hard to believe that even the most diehard fans of the franchise will say, \u2018I\u2019m not going to care about this team and root for this team because they have a different name.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn August, Forbes put the value of the Redskins brand \u2014 calculated as the team\u2019s total value minus the value of its stadium, shared NFL revenue and value attributable to the lucrative Washington area market \u2014 at $145 million .\n\nLet\u2019s use this figure to start the bidding. No Kickstarter campaign has ever raised more than seven figures, let alone nine. So, unless activists such as Suzan Harjo want to try their luck on Indiegogo.com, additional money would have to be found elsewhere.\n\nWhere to look?\n\nThe D.C. Council denounced the name, but would it pass a much-loathed tax on, say, game-day liquor sales to build a kitty? Perhaps wealthy, politically correct Washingtonians reluctant to root for the Redskins could take up the slack. Or maybe not: According to a Washington Post poll, two-thirds of our city doesn\u2019t think the name should be changed. Even sportscaster Bob Costas, who called the team\u2019s name \u201ca slur \u201d and makes something like $5 million each year, couldn\u2019t foot the bill.\n\nNo, name change advocates can\u2019t rely on crowdfunding, bake sales and car washes. They need a billionaire.\n\nFinding one wealthy person to help pay Snyder off is the most elegant solution to the Redskins stalemate. Given Washingtonians\u2019 apathy, finding Mr. or Ms. Big avoids the messy collective action demanded by doomed boycotts or half-measures such as Wilson High School\u2019s proposed ban on Redskins gear . Snyder, a billionaire himself, may prove receptive to a cash-on-the-barrel offer from an even more in\u00adcred\u00adibly rich person.\n\nAccording to Forbes, there are about 1,400 billionaires in the world. Who would step up?\n\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s no marquee Native American Croesus. Ray Halbritter, a representative of the Oneida Indian nation flush with New York gaming revenue who\u2019s spoken out against Snyder, recently denied that he\u2019s a billionaire. Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and Saudi magnate Walid bin Talal don\u2019t seem to have the Skins on their radars. Given her close relationship with Obama, Oprah Winfrey might be a good candidate \u2014 then again, her OWN network only recently began turning a profit, and she declined a chance to promote the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhat about new Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos? A petition is already circulating urging him to ban the use of the term in these pages.\n\nI know: The idea of bribing a wealthy NFL overlord to do something he should do anyway will bring critics of the name no small amount of psychological suffering.\n\nBig deal. Suffering is what political change is all about. Under this scheme, Redskins fans don\u2019t need to stage sit-ins, endure beatings or go to war. Those who want to make a difference have it easy \u2014 they\u2019ll just need to open their wallets.\n\nPaying to change the Redskins\u2019 name would be less a political act than a consumer choice: not marching on Washington but coughing up more to drink Coca-Cola out of a bottle instead of a can.\n\nSnyder has responded to emotional arguments about his team\u2019s name \u2014 Change this name because it hurts us \u2014 with an emotional argument of his own: Changing this name will hurt me and my team\u2019s fans.\n\nBut what if an organized group of Pigskins advocates \u2014 plus a wealthy donor \u2014 came to him with a substantial payoff that proved that their hurt was bigger than his? What if they sweated to raise a massive sum, then humbled themselves before Snyder and were willing to fork over the cash in exchange for a promise?\n\nHow could Snyder turn them down?\n\nRead more from Outlook, friend us on Facebook, and follow us on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "redskins name change, redskins change name, dan snyder redskins name, redskins name value, redskins, redskins name, dan snyder, justin moyer, redskins justin moyer, redskins name offensive, charles krauthammer redskins, obama redskins, city council redskins, david Haigh, patrick hruby, sports on earth, bob costas redskins, bezos redskins, oprah redskins", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Those who don\u2019t like \u201cRedskins\u201d should pay Dan Snyder to change it.", "title": "How to change the \u2018Redskins\u2019 name: Pay Dan Snyder off", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-to-change-the-redskins-name-pay-dan-snyder-off/2013/11/26/e400d6a2-417b-11e3-a624-41d661b0bb78_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/WashingtonPost/Content/Blogs/reliable-source/StandingArt/AP091217010072.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-to-change-the-redskins-name-pay-dan-snyder-off/2013/11/26/e400d6a2-417b-11e3-a624-41d661b0bb78_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "redskins name change, redskins change name, dan snyder redskins name, redskins name value, redskins, redskins name, dan snyder, justin moyer, redskins justin moyer, redskins name offensive, charles krauthammer redskins, obama redskins, city council redskins, david Haigh, patrick hruby, sports on earth, bob costas redskins, bezos redskins, oprah redskins", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "e400d6a2-417b-11e3-a624-41d661b0bb78", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Those who don\u2019t like \u201cRedskins\u201d should pay Dan Snyder to change it."}, "article_summary": "Redskins owner Dan Snyder has refused good advice from diverse quarters on changing his team\u2019s offensive name.\nFinding one wealthy person to help pay Snyder off is the most elegant solution to the Redskins stalemate.\nThat\u2019s not going to change if you change the name.\u201dChanging the name could be more profitable than keeping it.\nIn an October letter to fans, Snyder waxed eloquent about what the team means to him: \u201cI still remember my first Redskins game.\nAfter years of ineffective rallies, op-eds, lawsuits, House bills and D.C.
