They hold monthly emergency management team meetings. They practice regional drills \u2013 plane crashes, active shooter events -- coordinated by the Center for Health Affairs. They engage in action review protocols that involve studying natural disasters such Katrina or terrorist attacks like the Paris shootings last November, to identify strategies that might help mitigate such tragedies.\n\nAfter reviewing footage of the Boston Marathon bombing in April 2013, for example, Dziedzicki said they noticed a lot of the wounded had lost limbs, and there was a lack of tourniquets to stop the bleeding.\n\nUniversity Hospitals then bought 2,000 Combat Application Tourniquets \u2013 which it also distributed to first responders such as the University Circle Police Department, Dziedzicki said.\n\nThe cut in federal funds makes such acts of preparedness harder, Dziedzicki said.\n\nIt also could affect the ability of regional hospitals to respond appropriately to a mass casualty event.\n\n\"While we have the necessary equipment now, who's to say there wouldn't be something we need in the future and the funds aren't there to pay for it,\" said Wendy Hoke, spokeswoman for St. Vincent Charity Medical Center.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Beth Gatlin, Ron Dziedzicki, University Hospitals of Cleveland, brussels-attacks, cleveland-clinic, metrohealth, university-hospitals, news", "title": "Cleveland hospitals prepared for events like Brussels bombings, but concerned over budget cuts", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Cleveland hospitals prepared for events like Brussels bombings, but concerned over budget cuts\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2016/03/area_hospitals_prepared_for_ev.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/plain_dealer_metro/photo/19998846-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"18247080\", \"pub_date\": \"2016-03-22T20:40:28Z\", \"author\": \"Christopher Evans, cleveland.com\", \"tags\": [\"@healthfit\",\"@real-time-news\",\"brussels-attacks\",\"cleveland-clinic\",\"metrohealth\",\"university-hospitals\"] }", "twitter": {"description": "In the wake of the terrorist bombings in Brussels, area hospitals raise concerns over cuts in federal funds earmarked for preparedness.", "creator": "@cevanscleveland", "image": "http://image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/plain_dealer_metro/photo/19998846-standard.jpg", "title": "Cleveland hospitals prepared for events like Brussels bombings, but concerned over budget cuts", "site": "@clevelanddotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, March 22, 2016,  4:42 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"Hospitals worried budget cuts could hurt disaster preparedness\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.cleveland.com/plain_dealer_metro/photo/belgium-attacks-72151e3055a14361.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"cevans\", \"author_nickname\": \"Christopher Evans, cleveland.com\", \"author_id\": \"5086\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Metro News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "cleveland.com", "description": "In the wake of the terrorist bombings in Brussels, area hospitals raise concerns over cuts in federal funds earmarked for preparedness.", "title": "Cleveland hospitals prepared for events like Brussels bombings, but concerned over budget cuts", "url": "http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2016/03/area_hospitals_prepared_for_ev.html", "image": "http://image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/plain_dealer_metro/photo/19998846-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "cleveland.com", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Christopher-Evans/809874019128517"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, March 22, 2016,  4:40 PM", "article_author": "Christopher Evans, cleveland.com", "Description": "In the wake of the terrorist bombings in Brussels, area hospitals raise concerns over cuts in federal funds earmarked for preparedness."}, "article_summary": "It also could affect the ability of regional hospitals to respond appropriately to a mass casualty event.\nThe center receives annual federal grants from the Department of Health and Human Services to help hospitals respond to cataclysmic events that range from tornadoes to terrorist attacks.\nThey practice regional drills \u2013 plane crashes, active shooter events -- coordinated by the Center for Health Affairs.\nCLEVELAND \u2013 Hospitals in northeast Ohio say they are well prepared to handle a mass casualty event, such as the terrorist bombings that killed at least 34 people and injured more than 106 others in Brussels Tuesday morning.\nThe cut in federal funds makes such acts of preparedness harder, Dziedzicki said."}
