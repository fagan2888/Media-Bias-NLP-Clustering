And while it remained a touchstone for some fiscal conservatives, the problems it tried to solve lost their urgency.\n\nIn part, that was an unintended side effect of the Federal Reserve\u2019s strategy to preserve the economy through the worst of the Great Recession. As it became clear that the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank\u2019s interest rate-setting authority, intended to keep the effective interest rate on government debt at zero, arguments about the cost of federal borrowing faded. After all, in the short term \u2014 the time frame in which most of our political decisions are made \u2014 the borrowed money was essentially free.\n\nThat is about to change, and it\u2019s probably a good idea for taxpayers to have a reasonable understanding of what a rising interest rate environment will mean for the federal budget.\n\nThe FOMC is, pretty plainly, going to start increasing its target Federal Funds rate in the not-too-distant future. The likely result is that investors, who have become accustomed to an environment in which they can\u2019t buy risk-free assets unless they agree to earn virtually nothing on them, will start looking for a higher yield. That means that as the U.S. Treasury issues more debt and rolls over existing obligations, the price it has to pay will start to rise.\n\nRelated: Home Buyers Borrowing More than Ever Before\n\nTo be clear, absent a highly unlikely economic catastrophe, interest rates are expected to remain at historically low levels for a considerable time to come. That said, as they rise, the consequences for the federal budget are fairly dramatic.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office, for instance, predicts that over the coming decade, U.S. interest payments as a share of the country\u2019s gross domestic product will more than double, from 1.3 percent in 2015 to 3.0 percent in 2025.\n\nFederal borrowing costs are complex \u2014 bonds are issued at varying maturities, and even if rates rise slightly in the near future, the effect on federal spending may not be obvious in the short term. Over time, though, a difference of less than a percentage point can add significantly to the debt.\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a federal spending watchdog group, has noted that projecting the effects of interest rates on federal debt over 75 years can be very difficult \u2014 but tweaking long-term assumptions about rates make a sizable difference.\n\nFor example, lowering the projected average long-run interest rate used in budget calculations from 4.7 percent to 3.95 percent results in federal debt of 92 percent of GDP in the year 2039, instead of 111 percent of GDP. Interest spending that year would be 3.6 percent of GDP instead of 4.7 percent.\n\nOn the other hand, an equal sized increase in the average long-run interest rate would result in federal debt at 130 percent of GDP, and an annual interest burden equal to 7.5 percent of GDP.\n\nAny analysis of federal fiscal policy involves many such moving parts and assumptions, including the benefits of economic growth and the professed willingness of members of Congress to overhaul a sclerotic tax code. But if nothing else, it\u2019s a virtual certainty that rising interest rates will, sooner or later, bring the federal deficit back into the spotlight.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Time was, politicians in Washington were falling all over each other to opine on the dangers of the federal debt and the burden of interest payments.
