The approval of Inflectra Tuesday is only the second time that the Food and Drug Administration has approved a quasi-generic biotech drug for the U.S. market. These so-called biosimilar drugs, already available in Europe, have the potential to generate billions of dollars in savings for insurers, doctors and patients in coming years. (Perrone, 4/5)\n\nThe Wall Street Journal: FDA Approves Rheumatoid Knockoff\n\nInflectra is what regulators and the drug industry call a \u201cbiosimilar\u201d to J&J\u2019s Remicade, which has been available since 1998 and had U.S. sales of $4.45 billion last year. A biosimilar is a close copy of a biotech drug, which is usually manufactured in living cells rather than synthesized chemically like traditional pills. The FDA last year approved the first biosimilar\u2014a Novartis AG version of Amgen\u2019s Neupogen drug for cancer chemotherapy patients\u2014using new criteria arising from a provision of the 2010 Affordable Care Act aimed at supporting a biosimilar market.
