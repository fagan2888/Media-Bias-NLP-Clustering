The Department of Homeland Security began hiring, illegally, more than 1,000 new bureaucrats to process applications for a waiver program that suspends immigration law for more than five million people.\n\n\n\nAmericans recognize the fundamental challenge these \"executive actions\" pose to the Constitutional balance of power. A large majority \u2014 68 percent, according to a recent Fox News poll \u2014 worry that \"Obama\u2019s use of executive orders and unilateral actions may be 'permanently altering' our country\u2019s system of checks and balances.\"\n\n\n\nThe immigration actions were only the most brazen of the legal contortions the Obama administration has performed to impose its preferred outcomes by bureaucratic overreach.\n\n\n\nWhen the President reached an agreement with China to cut U.S. carbon emissions dramatically (a target that would require major domestic policy changes), he announced he has no plan to submit the agreement to Congress. Instead, the administration justifies rewriting environmental regulations by citing the official-sounding \"Climate Action Plan,\" which, like the immigration policy, is nothing more than a presidential speech.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama nullified the 1996 welfare reform law\u2019s work requirement by announcing HHS will grant waivers to states that don\u2019t want to enforce it \u2014 waivers which the law gives the President no authority to grant and states no authority to implement.\n\n\n\nThe administration paid $178 billion to insurance companies to compensate them for higher-than-expected costs under Obamacare. As the House of Representatives' lawsuit against the President points out, the law does not, in fact, give the administration the authority to transfer that money. But the bureaucrats did it anyway.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the administration\u2019s most ingenious maneuver \u2014 and among the most dangerous precedents \u2014 has been \"Operation Choke Point,\" in which officials at the Justice Department, FDIC and CFPB collaborate in an effort to put law-abiding American companies out of business.\n\n\n\nThey do so by pressuring banks and payment processors to deny service to entire categories of perfectly legal businesses \u2014 effectively crippling those industries\u2019 ability to function. A 2011 document from the FDIC names 30 industries of focus, including \"ammunition sales,\" \"firearms sales,\" \"pay day loans,\" \"coin dealers,\" \"online gambling,\" \"tobacco sales,\" \"racist materials,\" \"pornography,\" and \"telemarketing,\" among others.\n\n\n\nBanks have been telling legal businesses in these industries that they can no longer serve them because federal regulators have threatened to hold banks liable for the businesses\u2019 activities.\n\n\n\nA report published last month by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee found that, in many cases, regulators targeted these legal industries out of \"personal animus,\" and \"effectively ordered banks to terminate all relationships\" with an industry that senior officials said in emails they \"literally cannot stand.\"\n\n\n\nThe United States Consumer Coalition, which advocates for consumer freedom to choose, published audio recordings this month from Mike Schuetz, who sells guns and ammunition in Wisconsin. Schuetz recorded employees of his credit union explaining to him how federal regulators had encouraged the credit union to terminate his account.\n\n\n\nAs the Breitbart reports:\n\n\n\n\"Examiners ... came in and looked at our accounts \u2026 looked at our books,\" one official of Heritage Credit Union is heard telling Schuetz on one of the tapes. \"Here\u2019s some accounts that we feel that we\u2019re going to regulate you on \u2026 and kinda put the screws to us as far as what we could and couldn\u2019t do. The regulatory and compliance issues that we said earlier are true. We never used to have to do that stuff \u2026 and our hands are tied by it.\"\n\n\n\nOther audio recordings are equally chilling. \"You wouldn\u2019t believe the regulations we have and when they came in and nailed us on that [accounts] there were about a dozen of them crawling around the building,\" a Heritage Credit Union official is heard on the tapes telling Schuetz.\n\n\n\nThis is a sign of an administration that has figured out how to do whatever it wants, whether Congress approves or not.\n\n\n\nThankfully, Congressman Sean Duffy, who chairs the Oversight subcommittee the House Financial Services Committee, has said he is considering hearings on Choke Point in the new Congress.\n\n\n\nThey are urgently needed. On every front, the Obama administration is pushing the limits of its authority, enforcing change by bureaucratic overreach.\n\n\n\nThese are dangerous precedents, extending executive power in ways difficult to reverse, at the expense of Congress\u2019s constitutional authority. The 68 percent of Americans who worry that the President is permanently altering the balance of power are right to be concerned, and their representatives should be, too. The new Congress has a mandate to reclaim its rightful authorities from an executive branch that is out of control. It should take the opportunity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2016 Newsmax.
