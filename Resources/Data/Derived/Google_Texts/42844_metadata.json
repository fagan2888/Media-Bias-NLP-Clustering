(Reuters) - A bacterial infection related to meningitis is to blame for the death of a University of Oregon student-athlete who was found unresponsive in her dorm room earlier this week, public health officials said on Friday.\n\nFreshman Lauren Jones, 18, was found unconscious on Tuesday and declared dead at a nearby hospital. An initial autopsy did not offer conclusive results, but tests completed on Friday confirmed that meningococcemia caused her death, Lane County Public Health spokesman Jason Davis said in a statement.\n\nJones was the fourth student at the school confirmed to have been infected with meningococcemia, a bacterial precursor to meningitis, since an outbreak began earlier this year. The other three students are all recovering, according to a statement issued by the university on Friday.\n\nThe university also announced plans for a \"full-scale vaccination program\" beginning the first week of March, though it had already been offering vaccinations upon request.\n\nDavis said the Lane County Public Health department is not offering meningococcemia vaccinations to the general public as risk of contracting the disease is \"extremely low\" for people not associated with the school.\n\nMeningococcemia spreads through close personal contact or prolonged exposure, and outbreaks of the bacterial infection are relatively rare, he told Reuters.\n\nBut the close living quarters of university dormitories can create opportunities for the infection to spread, and several college campus outbreaks are typically reported every year.\n\nThe University of Oregon said in its statement that increased clinical staff will be available to offer vaccines to students next week, ahead of a more concerted vaccination effort that will begin in two weeks.\n\n(By Courtney Sherwood; Editing by Curtis Skinner)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "meningitis, bacteria, blame, oregon, students, death", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A bacterial infection related to meningitis is to blame for the death of a University of Oregon student-athlete who was found unresponsive in her dorm room earlier this week.", "title": "Meningitis Bacteria To Blame For Oregon Student's Death", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/meningitis-bacteria-blame-oregon-students-death-323108", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/22/meningitis.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A bacterial infection related to meningitis is to blame for the death of a University of Oregon student-athlete who was found unresponsive in her dorm room earlier this week.", "title": "Meningitis Bacteria To Blame For Oregon Student's Death", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/meningitis-bacteria-blame-oregon-students-death-323108", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/22/meningitis.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/22/meningitis.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-02-22T08:19:50-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-22T08:22:09-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A bacterial infection related to meningitis is to blame for the death of a University of Oregon student-athlete who was found unresponsive in her dorm room earlier this week."}, "article_summary": "A bacterial infection related to meningitis is to blame for the death of a University of Oregon student-athlete who was found unresponsive in her dorm room earlier this week.\nPORTLAND, Ore.
