(Wikimedia Commons Photo/Kevin Hale)\n\nI wrote last June about an unfortunate British guy who, after his leg was broken by thieves, was told by the government that his injury wasn\u2019t serious enough for an ambulance.\n\nThe poor chap eventually was driven home by some cops and then had to take an Uber to the hospital.\n\nWhile writing about this story, I semi-joked about what would be required to get an ambulance.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re about to die, they\u2019ll send an ambulance. But not for anything less than that.\u201d\n\nLittle did I realize that the bureaucrats would prove me wrong.\n\nHere are some amazing excerpts from a story in the U.K.-based Telegraph.\n\n\u201cA dying pensioner wrote a heartbreaking \u2018I love you note\u2019 to his daughters while he waited two hours for an ambulance to respond to his call for help following a heart attack. \u2026The retired mechanical fitter \u2026 pulled a cord in his flat in Prenton in Birkenhead, Merseyside, to sound an alarm in a 24/7 emergency call centre and could be heard by the call handler shouting: \u201cHelp.\u201d \u2026 The call handler dialled 999 but Mr. Volante\u2019s case was given a low priority by the ambulance service and paramedics took 1hr 40mins to arrive. They found him dead on his living room floor.\u201d\n\nIn a touching but tragic gesture, the deceased spent some of his wait time writing a note to his daughters.\n\n\u201cA heartbreaking note was found in Mr Volante\u2019s flat after his death, which read: \u2018I love you Rita, I love you Deb, Dad.\u2019 This was a reference to his two daughters, Debbie Moore and Rita Cuthell.\u201d\n\nI suppose, to be fair, that we can\u2019t fully blame Mr. Volante\u2019s death on government incompetence. He may have died even if the ambulance arrived in a timely fashion.\n\nBut imagine what it would be like to place a very serious call and to be treated like an afterthought.\n\nThough the government at least offered an insincere apology, so I guess that counts for \u2026 um, nothing. According to The Telegraph:\n\n\u201c\u2026 a North West Ambulance Service spokesperson said: \u2018The Trust would like to express its sincere condolences to Mr Volante\u2019s family during this difficult time.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut let\u2019s look at the bright side. If the ambulance had been on time and Mr. Volante had been admitted to the hospital, the government may have starved him to death instead.\n\nI\u2019m guessing a heart attack \u2013 even one where it takes you 90 minutes to die \u2013 would be preferable, particularly since you can\u2019t be sure whether government-run healthcare will kill you accidentally or kill you deliberately.\n\nP.S. Here\u2019s my collection of horror stories about the U.K.\u2019s version of Obamacare: here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here,here, here, here, here, here, here and here. By the way, Paul Krugman tells us that all these stories are false. So who are you going to believe, him or your lying eyes?\n\nP.P.S. To be fair, some screw-ups are inevitable, even in a perfectly designed healthcare system. But I would argue that horror stories are more common when the profit motive is weakened or eliminated. If you\u2019re a Brit and you die or suffer because of crappy government-run healthcare, there\u2019s no feedback mechanism to punish the doctor and/or hospital (or, in the above case, ambulance service). Their budgets already are pre-determined. Likewise, if you\u2019re an American and you die or suffer because of sub-standard Medicare or Medicaid treatment, there\u2019s presumably no effective feedback budgetary mechanism.\n\nDaniel J.
