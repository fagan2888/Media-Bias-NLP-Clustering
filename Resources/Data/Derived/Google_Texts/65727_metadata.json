Lott, a certified application counselor, stood at her computer terminal and typed the word \u201cFlorida\u201d into the insurance exchange network Web site.\n\n\u201cThe system is down at the moment,\u201d it read.\n\nShe smiled at Wesley Trumpler, 47, and explained, \u201cWe\u2019ve had some slow times getting on, and we\u2019re unable to get started.\u201d An 800 number popped up. \u201cPeople call this number, but they have had the same problem,\u201d she added.\n\nWith that, she walked Mr. Trumpler over to a nearby chair, gave him a brief overview of the program \u2014 \u201cThis is Obamacare, right?\u201d he asked \u2014 and asked if he wanted to come back.\n\nThen she gave Mr. Trumpler, who is unemployed and is recovering from a gunshot wound, an appointment to come back next week to try again. He was thankful, not a trace of frustration on his face. He had heard about Obamacare, but, until he walked into the clinic for a medical appointment, he did not realize he could sign up for it beginning Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI need insurance,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s too expensive.\u201d\n\nAll day, trained application counselors typed in \u201cFlorida,\u201d or got as far as entering some applicants\u2019 personal information, before the system crashed. Sometimes the crash came when it was time to answer a security question. Other times applicants put in their security question answers but could go no further.\n\nOut of nearly 72 applicants who sat down with counselors by noon, none were able to access the marketplace. All of the applicants were given appointments to come back another week.\n\n\u201cAs with any system, there will be glitches in the first weeks and months,\u201d said Annie Neasman, the president and chief executive of the community health center, in Liberty City, a predominantly black neighborhood, where seven counselors spent Tuesday explaining the program and trying to sign people up.\n\nAt Trice, counselors aimed to help fill out applications for most people who walked in to tend to their medical needs. Many of them were unemployed and unlikely to be eligible for the exchange, but counselors do not know that until the patients try to apply. If they are rejected, they are given an exemption letter so they are not penalized for not having insurance.\n\nIn Florida, which has the second-highest rate of uninsured people, and where the state government has rebuffed the program, allowing the federal government to run it, applicants faced obstacles even before they arrived here on Tuesday. The state\u2019s Health Department opted not to allow counselors inside state health offices, although several South Florida counties defied that ban.\n\nOnly an estimated 35 navigators have been approved by the state so far to help answer applicants\u2019 questions about the exchanges. Some nonprofit organizations, facing cumbersome rules and paperwork, decided to opt out of the navigator program.\n\nInstead, much of the work is being done by counselors at health clinics that are working to sign people up as they come through the doors. Their help is crucial to the program\u2019s success in communities like this. Several people did not have computers at home; others said they would have a hard time wading through all the information; some Haitians and Hispanics said they faced language barriers.\n\nBut there was no avoiding the delays on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been running into some glitches,\u201d Ms. Lott explained to the next applicant. \u201cI want to give you fair warning, but if it happens, no problem, I will give you an appointment and you can come back.\u201d\n\nMs. Lott also stressed that the information was private. It would either go directly into the Web site or it would stay with the applicant. Gov. Rick Scott has expressed concerns over privacy and has raised questions about the possibility of identity theft and fraud in a state that is awash with that kind of crime.\n\nBertha Stewart, 53, who is unemployed, stood by Ms. Lott\u2019s side. Ms. Lott asked her whether she wanted to type in the information herself, and she said no. Computers, she said, are not her thing.\n\nAfter long pauses, there was a moment of euphoria when they actually got past the security questions screen.\n\n\u201cSuccess,\u201d Ms. Lott said.\n\nBut the moment did not last long. \u201cYour account cannot be created at this time,\u201d the screen said.\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is unbelievable.\u201d\n\nMs. Stewart, who lost her housekeeping job three years ago, just smiled. She took the appointment card and then waited to be seen by a doctor for her asthma. She cannot afford insurance or her medications, so she is holding out hope that she will qualify for the exchanges or some sort of benefit.\n\n\u201cI am patient,\u201d Ms. Stewart said. \u201cThat\u2019s how you get stuff done. You are patient.\u201d\n\nSitting in an office, Bleyette Georges, 45, chitchatted in Haitian Creole with another counselor. Ms. Georges, who has eight children, four of them grown, heard about Obamacare on the news and decided to sign up.\n\nHer small store, which sold clothes, shoes and perfume, went under four years ago in the throes of the recession. She tried a restaurant, but that too failed. With no insurance, Ms. Georges said she had nothing to lose.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I will apply and see. Money don\u2019t come off trees, but there are no jobs out there.\u201d\n\nHer luck was no better. She did not even get to the security question. She was asked if she wanted an appointment.\n\n\u201cI want to come back,\u201d Ms. Georges said. \u201cLeave it an open appointment time for me.\u201d\n\nHer counselor, Lexilia Neptune, grinned and shrugged off yet another failed attempt.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s OK,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can wait.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131001133337, "BN": "affordable-care-act", "DISPLAYDATE": "October 1, 2013", "article": {"published_time": 1380648817, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/lizette_alvarez/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2013-10-30T21:09:20-04:00"}, "keywords": "Computers and the Internet,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),HealthCare.gov,Miami (Fla),Uncategorized", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Lizette Alvarez", "SCG": "affordable-care-act", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Lizette Alvarez", "byl": "Lizette Alvarez", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2013/10/01/at-a-miami-health-center-told-to-come-back-another-day/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "description": "In one of Miami\u2019s poorest neighborhoods, there was lots of interest in enrolling for health care, but the technology wasn\u2019t cooperating.", "card": "summary", "title": "At a Miami Health Center, Told to Come Back Another Day"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/affordable-care-act/post", "description": "In one of Miami\u2019s poorest neighborhoods, there was lots of interest in enrolling for health care, but the technology wasn\u2019t cooperating.", "CG": "U.S.", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "October 1, 2013", "org": "HealthCare.gov", "geo": "Miami (Fla)", "utime": 20131030210920, "PUD": 20131001, "pdate": 20131001, "des": "Computers and the Internet;Health Insurance and Managed Care;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "In Practice", "description": "In one of Miami\u2019s poorest neighborhoods, there was lots of interest in enrolling for health care, but the technology wasn\u2019t cooperating.", "title": "At a Miami Health Center, Told to Come Back Another Day", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2013/10/01/at-a-miami-health-center-told-to-come-back-another-day/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v3/../../packages/images/nytdesign/2013/national/inPractice/inPractice-75.png", "type": "article"}, "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "At a Miami Health Center, Told to Come Back Another Day", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "The state\u2019s Health Department opted not to allow counselors inside state health offices, although several South Florida counties defied that ban.\nMs. Lott asked her whether she wanted to type in the information herself, and she said no.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been running into some glitches,\u201d Ms. Lott explained to the next applicant.\n\u201cSuccess,\u201d Ms. Lott said.\nThen she gave Mr. Trumpler, who is unemployed and is recovering from a gunshot wound, an appointment to come back next week to try again."}
