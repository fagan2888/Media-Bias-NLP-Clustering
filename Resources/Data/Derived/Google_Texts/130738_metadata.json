An additional $1 million in AFSCME \u201cContributions, Gifts and Grants\u201d went to political nonprofits.\n\nAFSCME did not respond to Watchdog.org questions about how political spending decisions are made and communicated to members, but the union\u2019s annual report showed a predictable partisan and ideological bent.\n\nThe union gave $600,000 to the Democratic Governors Association, $325,000 to the California Democratic Party, $300,000 to Washington State Democrats, $250,000 to the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, and $100,000 each to Democratic Party accounts in Nevada and Ohio.\n\nDemocrat-aligned political action committees and super PACs got more than $1 million from AFSCME last year, including contributions of $500,000 to America Works USA, $250,000 to Senate Majority PAC, and $150,000 each to House Majority PAC and American Bridge 21st Century.\n\nAFSCME sent union coalition AFL-CIO $599,591 and AFL-CIO organizing arm Working America $1,130,600, flagged as political expenses. Neither of those expenditures matched the $1,475,000 AFSCME sent to AFSCME Illinois Council 31 for state and local campaigns.\n\nAs in previous years, nominally independent left-wing groups benefited from AFSCME leaders\u2019 use of union funds in 2015. Among other political expenditures, AFSCME gave:\n\n$1 million to Americans United for Change.\n\n$375,000 to America Votes.\n\n$300,000 to Partnership for Working Families.\n\n$250,000 to Center for American Progress.\n\n$150,000 to The Progressive Agenda.\n\n$100,000 to Progressive Congress.\n\n$100,000 to US Action.\n\nSecretive donor network Democracy Alliance received $135,000 from AFSCME, and Democracy Alliance\u2019s Committee on States project got $525,000. Forward Philadelphia received $625,000, and Pennsylvanians for Judicial Reform received $475,000.\n\nAFSCME sent $150,000 to AFSCME Ohio Council 8, $302,245 to AFSCME Iowa Council 61 and $475,000 to Kentucky union front group Kentucky Family Values. Kentucky held a gubernatorial election in 2015.\n\nRELATED: Service Employees International Union sinks another $30 million into politics\n\nMany of AFSCME\u2019s donations to progressive nonprofits were not disclosed as political activity. \u201cContributions, Gifts and Grants\u201d expenditures reported by the union included $174,000 to the Economic Policy Institute, a union think tank, and $160,000 to the National Public Pension Coalition.\n\nContributions of $110,000 to the leftist Roosevelt Institute and $100,000 to tax-hike advocacy group Citizens for Tax Justice weren\u2019t reported as political spending, either.\n\nTrey Kovacs, a policy analyst for the free-market Competitive Enterprise Institute, said it\u2019s no surprise AFSCME obscures a portion of its political spending as \u201cContributions, Gifts and Grants\u201d in annual reports.\n\n\u201cMoreover, nearly all activity taken by government unions is inherently political,\u201d Kovacs told Watchdog.org. \u201cIt is common for unions to use fees from non-members to influence how public money is spent, which is blatantly political.\u201d\n\n\u201cNon-members should not have to pay for this activity, yet a number of states have given government unions the absurd privilege of forcing hardworking men and women to pay for representation they don\u2019t want and activity they vehemently disagree with,\u201d he added.\n\nKovacs said AFSCME\u2019s 2015 spending reaffirms the union\u2019s sharply political nature, and should serve as another argument for states to pass right-to-work laws protecting each worker\u2019s right to choose whether to pay a union.\n\nPublic employee petitioners in the Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association case that recently resulted in a 4-4 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court argued that all public-sector union spending is inherently political because the unions negotiate over public services and taxpayer money.\n\nAFSCME and other public employee unions celebrated the split ruling, but the petitioners have asked for a new hearing to be scheduled when a replacement for the late Justice Antonin Scalia is seated.\n\nElsewhere in AFSCME\u2019s 2015 report to the Department of Labor, a large portion of spending AFSCME reported as \u201cRepresentational Activities\u201d was devoted to recruiting new members instead of representing existing members.\n\nThe entirety of AFSCME\u2019s single-largest representational activity expenditure \u2014 a $2.5 million payment to New York affiliate Civil Service Employees Association \u2014 was for \u201corganizing assistance.\u201d\n\nThe union\u2019s Washington, D.C., headquarters reported $500,000 in organizing assistance payments to AFSCME Illinois Council 31, $350,000 in organizing assistance payments to AFSCME Washington Council 28, and $314,000 in organizing assistance payments to Ohio-based AFSCME Local 4 as representational activities.\n\nAFSCME had 1,305,128 members at the end of 2015, a loss of nearly 32,000 members from the year before and more than 160,000 since 2010.\n\nCompared with 2014 \u2014 a midterm election year in which AFSCME dumped $65 million into politics \u2014 last year was a slow year for AFSCME political spending.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Left-wing politicians, lobbyists and activist groups raked in more than $28 million in government workers' union dues last year.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Left-wing politicians, lobbyists and activist groups raked in more than $28 million in government workers' union dues last year.", "title": "Public employee union spends $28 million on progressive politics - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2016/04/afscme-protest-cuny-twitter-2016-03-300px.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-30T01:10:00+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/261894/public-employee-union-spends-28-million-progressive-politics/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Left-wing politicians, lobbyists and activist groups raked in more than $28 million in government workers' union dues last year.", "title": "Public employee union spends $28 million on progressive politics - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2016/04/afscme-protest-cuny-twitter-2016-03-300px.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Labor", "tag": "AFSCME,Competitive Enterprise Institute,Friedrichs v.
