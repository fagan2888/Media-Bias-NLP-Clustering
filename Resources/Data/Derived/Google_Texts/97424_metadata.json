Rather than believing in universal human equality, he would invidiously measure the capacities of human beings to determine whether they are \u201cpersons.\u201d\n\nThose with insufficient capacities, are to be deemed human \u201cnon-persons,\u201d are to be viewed of lesser moral value, and hence, potentially subject to both killing and objectification for harvesting, medical experimentation, etc.\n\nHe also supports health care rationing based on quality of life. This blatant medical discrimination would victimize babies born with severe disabilities\u2013whose care, Singer argues, should not be paid by national health insurance schemes.\n\nThe National Council on Disability is not amused. From its press release:\n\nOn Sunday April 16, contentious Princeton Professor Peter Singer, once again argued that it is \u201creasonable\u201d for the government or private insurance companies to deny treatment to infants with disabilities. Singer\u2019s remarks were made on \u201cAaron Klein Investigative Radio,\u201d which is broadcast on New York\u2019s AM 970 and Philadelphia 990 AM. In the interview, which was perhaps ironically conducted as part of a press tour Singer is currently on promoting his new book about charities, \u201cThe Most Good You Can Do: How Effective Altruism Is Changing Ideas About Living Ethically,\u201d the professor advocated the shocking claim that health care laws like the Affordable Care Act should be more overt about rationing and that we should acknowledge the necessity of \u201cintentionally ending the lives of severely disabled infants.\u201d\n\nWithout offering any concrete measure on how quality of life could or should be determined, Singer admitted, \u201cI don\u2019t want my health insurance premiums to be higher so that infants who can experience zero quality of life can have expensive treatments.\u201d\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!\n\nThe NDC makes a point about Singer that is also lost to the media slavishly pushing assisted suicide/euthanasia, which also threatens the lives and bodily integrity of people with disabilities:\n\nIncreasingly, negative predictions of quality of life have little to do with the actual life experiences of people with disabilities. People with disabilities commonly report more satisfaction with their lives than others might expect. Though it might surprise Singer and those with limited imaginations, even people with disabilities who encounter obstacles, prejudice, and discrimination, derive satisfaction and pleasure from their lives.\n\nSinger is something of the ethicist in chief for such liberal organs as the New York Times and leftist columnists like Nicholas Kristof. That says a lot about liberal thinking, it seems to me.\n\nThe Left talks a good game of equality, but when it comes to people with disabilities (among other categories of human life), they don\u2019t really mean it. Indeed, when they support Peter Singer, they validate invidious quality-of-life bigotry.\n\nLifeNews.com Note: Wesley J.
