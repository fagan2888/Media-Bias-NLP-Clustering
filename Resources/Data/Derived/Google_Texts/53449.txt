It was Rocky … Really Rocky … Hockey.

Through six seasons, three ownerships, seemingly relentless talk of the team folding or moving, a revolving door on the locker room and one playoff berth, and with a loyal cadre of fans (but not enough of them), the Colorado Rockies were the state’s first chance in the NHL from 1976-82.

As part of the Avalanche’s recognition of the state’s hockey history Saturday night at the game against Columbus, seven former members of the Rockies — including Hall of Fame winger Lanny McDonald, intimidating defenseman Barry Beck and one-time captain Wilf Paiement — signed autographs for a long line of fans on the Pepsi Center concourse.

This might tell you all you need to know about the Rockies: McDonald, Paiement and Beck all were traded away.

“We absolutely had the greatest time when we played here,” McDonald said. “Unfortunately, we weren’t as good as the Avalanche was. But the bottom line was there was about 8,000 great hockey fans that showed up every night. We just needed to be a .500 hockey club and it would have been here forever. But times change, things change and it’s great to have a chance to come back after all these years.”

Beck was 22 and considered a cornerstone in only his third season when the Rockies traded him to the New York Rangers for a care package of six players. At the time, he was having a home built near Evergreen.

“My life completely changed at that point,” Beck said. “I was really hurt by that. We had a good young team, and I thought we could get a lot accomplished here. It was nice to see when the Avalanche came here they won right away so the fans didn’t have to wait long. But all the Rockies players were proud of that team and thought we were going places.”

Eventually, though, that place was New Jersey — when the franchise became the New Jersey Devils.
