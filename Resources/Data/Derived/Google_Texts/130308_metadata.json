We are one in the Lord, and we pray that our unity will one day be restored,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they will know that we are Christians by our love.\u201d\n\nIn an opening prayer, the Rev. Almetha Lewis asked healing for the victims\u2019 families as well as the shooter.\n\n\u201cTouch those families that were affected by this tragedy,\u201d she said in an opening prayer. \u201cTouch, Lord, even the one who slayed them.\u201d\n\n\u201cTouch us that we can forgive.\u201d\n\nAt that moment, a parishioner shouted out: \u201cIt\u2019s who we are.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nA few hundreds visitors not part of the regular congregation flocked to Denver\u2019s Shorter Community AME Church to gather in support and remembrance.\n\nPictures of the Charleston victims punctuated announcements of upcoming church events on a large screen in the sanctuary.\n\nThe Rev. Timothy E. Tyler, the pastor at Shorter, reminded his congregation that \u201cno matter how evil things seem to be, God is still in charge.\u201d\n\nHe said he has received many calls, letters, flowers and even a note on the front door of the church in support of the church during this \u201cdark time.\u201d\n\nSen. Michael Bennet attended the service with his wife and three children. Rep. Diana DeGette also was there.\n\n\u201cWe need to work passionately, relentlessly, for the realization of the American Dream,\u201d Bennet told the gathering. \u201cIn these trying times, Colorado stands with you.\u201d\n\nNearly 100 members of Denver\u2019s Providence Bible Church joined the service.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our honor and duty to walk with you,\u201d said Providence Pastor Jason Janz. \u201cWe are your ally. We don\u2019t want you to be discouraged, afraid, or take any steps backward in your fight for justice.\u201d\n\nTyler said he will travel to Charleston for the funeral of Emanuel pastor Clementa Pinckney on Friday. He is bringing with him donations for Pinckney\u2019s family collected during Sunday\u2019s service.\n\n\u201cEvil will not win,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cHate will not have the last word.\u201d Tierra Smith\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nThe 9:15 a.m. service at the Harvest Christian Center in Aurora was full of energy. Churchgoers were greeted with hugs, singers sang gospel music and the crowd clapped along.\n\nAs Foreman stood at the lectern talking passionately about the events that unfolded Wednesday, which he characterized as a terrorist attack, the faces of the victims were shown on screens behind him.\n\nThose who lost their lives inside the Emanuel AME Church were, Foreman said, brothers and sisters of God who died doing what they loved: serving God. He continued by saying they had now found comfort.\n\nHe told his followers not to dwell on wounds because it causes one to live in the past. But he said it\u2019s important to recognize wounds to learn from them.\n\n\u201cWithout a wound, there is no progress,\u201d he told them. Matthew Leonard\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nAt the Jefferson Unitarian Church in Golden, the Rev. Eric Banner stood in front of a congregation of about 100 mostly white parishioners and passionately said that there is a volatile problem with racism, gun control and the examples that men and fathers set in their communities.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not talking about self-defense, and I\u2019m not talking about protecting yourself from violent crimes,\u201d Banner said. \u201cI\u2019m talking about young, white men showing up with their anger and their guns and their lack of understanding of what it means to be a man who lives and models in love and integrity.\u201d\n\nAfter calling for a single, unified vision of manhood and fatherhood centered on universal acceptance and moral responsibility, dozens of people broke out in fervent applause.\n\n\u201cI appreciate someone on Father\u2019s Day talking about what it means to be a man in this context,\u201d said Lakewood resident Rex Nelson. \u201cMy wife and I are from Alabama, and this hits really close to home for us.\u201d\n\nNelson and his wife, Deda, remember the last time they attended their church in Birmingham in 1969. Their congregation was voting on whether or not to allow a black person to join their parish.\n\n\u201cNothing has changed in all this time,\u201d Deda Nelson said. \u201cThere\u2019s still this infection of apathy that hasn\u2019t gone away. And (society) has not been acting in a way that will solve these issues\u201d of racism and gun control. Megan Mitchell\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nClarence McDavid, deacon at Cure d\u2019Ars Catholic Church in northeast Denver, was the rare faith leader who did not have to put aside a planned sermon Sunday to find a message in response to the Charleston tragedy.\n\nHis sermon was pulled from the Book of Job, with a focus on the way fear can shake the foundations of faith. But those who read, teach and live by the Gospel can not only push through the most brutal of life\u2019s struggles but set an example of faith, love and compassion, McDavid said.\n\n\u201cHate won\u2019t solve anything,\u201d McDavid said. \u201cI believe that the people in South Carolina have shown us how, instead of perpetuating the cycle of anger and revenge, they have shown us how to make it different.\n\n\u201cWhere their action is an action of love that says \u2018I have read the Gospel, believe the Gospel and am acting in the way of the Gospel.\u2019 \u201c\n\nWhile the shooting raises concerns about church security, McDavid said those issues have always existed and need to be balanced by the desire to keep the doors of worship open to strangers.\n\n\u201cAre we now supposed to lock our churches as a way to be prepared?\u201d McDavid asked. \u201cThat our churches, with our dwindling populations of people, would prevent those that feel the call for that moment from coming in?\n\n\u201cWe have to keep our doors open, with the belief that people will come in that otherwise wouldn\u2019t have and will be changed.\u201d Austin Briggs\n\nMatthew Nussbaum: 303-954-1666, mnussbaum@ denverpost.com or twitter.com/ MatthewNussbaum", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Charleston church massacre victims remembered in Denver services", "title": "Charleston church massacre victims remembered in Denver services", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/21/charleston-church-massacre-victims-remembered-in-denver-services/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150621_094018_CD22CHARLESTONLOCAL_2JL0590x.jpg", "height": 681}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150621_094018_CD22CHARLESTONLOCAL_2JL0590x.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-21T21:06:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T23:19:45+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Pictures of the Charleston victims punctuated announcements of upcoming church events on a large screen in the sanctuary.\nAt churches across Denver on Sunday, the nine victims in the South Carolina church massacre last week were remembered as Christians who died in an act of love and worship.\n\u201cIn these trying times, Colorado stands with you.\u201dNearly 100 members of Denver\u2019s Providence Bible Church joined the service.\nWe are one in the Lord, and we pray that our unity will one day be restored,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAre we now supposed to lock our churches as a way to be prepared?\u201d McDavid asked."}
