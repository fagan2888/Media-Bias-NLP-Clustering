It was too much to put out with a fire extinguisher, so we kind of had to get everybody out of the house, call the fire department and hope for the best.\u201d\n\nMuch of Jarrett\u2019s cherished memories from playing days at Clemson, Rockdale County High School and youth football were lost in the flames.\n\n\u201cTrophies, awards. We had TVs and a pool table, different clothes. It was a lot of stuff,\u201d Jarrett said. \u201cBut it\u2019s just material stuff, man. The main thing was getting everybody safe.\u201d\n\nAccording to a FoxSports.com report, the cause of the fire is thought to be electrical, though it is still being investigated.\n\nGetting selected by the home-state team, and chosen to reunite with a former defensive line mate, helped matters.\n\n\u201cGoing to Atlanta definitely lifted a lot of spirits today,\u201d Jarrett said. \u201cWe just see nothing but good coming from this. We\u2019re going to stick together as a family and hope for the best.\u201d\n\nTaken No. 137 overall, Jarrett couldn\u2019t hide his disappointment, with or without a personal tragedy.\n\n\u201cThe wait was really, really tough for me,\u201d Jarrett said. \u201cI definitely had a good vibe with (the Falcons); every time they were picking, I thought they were about to call my name. I just believe everything happens for a reason. It was definitely tough, but when my name was finally called, I calmed down.\u201d\n\nA three-star recruit out of high school who was a consensus all-ACC first-teamer last fall, the chip on Jarrett\u2019s shoulder throughout college will accompany him to the pros.\n\n\u201cOh yeah, absolutely, absolutely. It has to,\u201d Jarrett said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way I play the game, and it\u2019s been working for me, so it won\u2019t change.\u201d\n\nThe Falcons spent the eighth overall pick on Clemson pass-rusher Vic Beasley two days ago. Beasley is from Adairsville, an hour northwest of Atlanta.\n\nSteward to the Bills\n\nIn the spring of 2011, the No. 1 national prep recruit via Rivals.com was Jadeveon Clowney. Ranked No. 15 was Sammy Watkins. At No. 13? Tony Steward.\n\nAlthough two torn ACL injuries ransacked his career, Steward cobbled together a fine senior campaign and was rewarded Saturday with a sixth-round selection by the Buffalo Bills.\n\nSteward tore one ACL in high school and the other his freshman year of college, in October 2011. He did not start a game his first three seasons, but started 12 games last fall and made 73 tackles, 10 tackles for a loss and 13 quarterback pressures.\n\n\u201cWords can\u2019t describe the feelings running through my body. Buffalo here we come!\u201d Steward wrote in a Twitter message Saturday.\n\nMirroring Steward\u2019s draft position, last year\u2019s No. 188 selection, Rams cornerback E.J. Gaines, signed a four-year, $2.3 million deal with a guaranteed signing bonus of $107,672.\n\nThis marks the third straight year and fifth out of six years that Buffalo drafted a Tiger, following Watkins last year (fourth overall) and safety Jonathan Meeks (a fifth-rounder) in 2013.\n\nPinion first punter\n\nLeaving school with one year of eligibility remaining, Clemson punter Bradley Pinion was the first specialist taken, picked up by San Francisco in the fifth round. Pinion is the Tigers\u2019 first punter or kicker drafted since the Bears took Chris Gardocki in the 1991 third round, a 24-year span.\n\nHowever, playing time should be hard to come by in the Bay Area. Punter Andy Lee, a 4-time All-Pro, recently signed a six-year, $20.4 million extension and is under contract with the 49ers through the 2018 season.\n\nNew homes\n\nWithin the first hour following the conclusion of the draft, three former Tigers signed contracts as undrafted free agents.\n\nSafety Robert Smith, who played at Woodland High, signed with the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nDefensive end Corey Crawford agreed to terms with the Washington Redskins, and quarterback Cole Stoudt did the same with the San Diego Chargers.\n\nOther reports of Clemson free-agent signings included offensive tackle Kalon Davis and defensive tackle Josh Watson to the Broncos, defensive end Tavaris Barnes to the Saints, and cornerback Garry Peters to the Panthers.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Clemson draft notes: Jarrett endures house fire, long wait before Falcons selection, Sports, \r\nSportsClemson, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Bradley Pinion,Clemson football,Grady Jarrett,NFL draft,Tony Steward", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "CLEMSON \u2014 Real-life adversity struck Grady Jarrett and his family, keeping in perspective his later-than-expected entry to the NFL.", "title": "Clemson draft notes: Jarrett endures house fire, long wait before Falcons selection", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150502/150509823/clemson-draft-notes-jarrett-endures-house-fire-long-wait-before-falcons-selection", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150502/PC20/150509823/AR/0/AR-150509823.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150502/PC20/150509823/AR/0/AR-150509823.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "CLEMSON \u2014 Real-life adversity struck Grady Jarrett and his family, keeping in perspective his later-than-expected entry to the NFL.", "title": "Clemson draft notes: Jarrett endures house fire, long wait before Falcons selection", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@hsprepzone", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150502/PC20/150509823/AR/0/AR-150509823.jpg?201505022129", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150509823}}, "keywords": "Clemson draft notes: Jarrett endures house fire, long wait before Falcons selection , Sports, \r\nSportsClemson, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Bradley Pinion,Clemson football,Grady Jarrett,NFL draft,Tony Steward", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-02T17:05:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-05-02T21:29:00Z", "author": "Aaron Brenner"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "CLEMSON \u2014 Real-life adversity struck Grady Jarrett and his family, keeping in perspective his later-than-expected entry to the NFL."}, "article_summary": "Clemson defensive tackle Grady Jarrett (50) was drafted by the Atlanta Falcons in the fifth round of the 2015 NFL Draft Saturday.\nSteward tore one ACL in high school and the other his freshman year of college, in October 2011.\nSafety Robert Smith, who played at Woodland High, signed with the Indianapolis Colts.\nNew homesWithin the first hour following the conclusion of the draft, three former Tigers signed contracts as undrafted free agents.\n(File/AP Photo/John Raoux)Real-life adversity struck Grady Jarrett and his family, keeping in perspective his later-than-expected entry to the NFL."}
