Smith, a USC professor and one of the study\u2019s authors, in an interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a diversity problem. We have an inclusion crisis.\u201d\n\nThe study, titled the Comprehensive Annenberg Report on Diversity, examined the 109 films released by major studios (including art-house divisions) in 2014 and 305 scripted, first-run TV and digital series across 31 networks and streaming services that aired from September 2014 to August 2015. More than 11,000 speaking characters were analyzed for gender, racial and ethnic representation and LGBT status. Some 10,000 directors, writers and show creators were examined, as was the gender of more than 1,500 executives.\n\nThe portrait is one of pervasive underrepresentation, no matter the media platform, from CEOs to minor characters. \u201cOverall, the landscape of media content is still largely whitewashed,\u201d the study concludes.\n\nIn the 414 studied films and series, only a third of speaking characters were female, and only 28.3 percent were from minority groups \u2014 about 10 percent less than the makeup of the U.S. population. Characters 40 years or older skew heavily male across film and TV: 74.3 percent male to 25.7 percent female.\n\nJust 2 percent of speaking characters were LGBT-identified. Among the 11,306 speaking characters studied, only seven were transgendered (and four were from the same series).\n\n\u201cWhen we start to step back to see this larger ecology, I think we see a picture of exclusion,\u201d said Smith. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t match the norms of the population of the United States.\u201d\n\nBehind the camera, the discrepancy is even greater. Directors overall were 87 percent white. Broadcast TV directors (90.4 percent white) were the least diverse.\n\nJust 15.2 percent of directors, 28.9 percent of writers and 22.6 percent of series creators were female. In film, the gender gap is greatest: Only 3.4 percent of the films studied were directed by women, and only two directors out of the 109 were black women: Ava DuVernay (\u201cSelma\u201d) and Amma Asante (\u201dBelle\u201d).\n\nUSC\u2019s study, which the school has been publishing in various forms for the last 10 years, also seeks to add a new metric in the conversation. The \u201cinclusivity index\u201d is a report card for the performances of 21st Century Fox, CBS, NBC Universal, Sony, the Walt Disney Co., Time Warner, Viacom, Amazon, Hulu and Netflix. Those companies encompass all the broadcast networks, most major cable channels, all of the major movie studios and three of the dominant streaming services.\n\nEach was rated by their percentage of female, minority and LGBT characters; and of female writers and directors. None of the six major studios rated better than 20 percent overall; Time Warner fared poorest of all with a score of zero. The report concludes that the film industry \u201cstill functions as a straight, white, boy\u2019s club.\u201d\n\nDisney, Sony, Paramount, Fox, Universal and Warner Bros. didn\u2019t immediate comment Sunday night.\n\nSome of the same companies, however, scored better when their TV and digital offerings were evaluated. Disney, the CW, Amazon and Hulu all scored 65 percent and above.\n\n\u201cWhen we turn to see where the problem is better or worse, the apex to this whole endeavor is: Everyone in film is failing, all of the companies investigated,\u201d said Smith. \u201cThey\u2019re impervious to change. But there are pockets of promise in television. There is a focus that change is possible. The very companies that are inclusive \u2014 Disney, CW, Hulu, Amazon to some degree \u2014 those companies, if they\u2019re producing and distributing motion pictures, can do this. We now have evidence that they can, and they can thrive.\u201d\n\nSome of the report\u2019s key findings include:\n\nIN FRONT OF THE CAMERA\n\n\u2014 Female characters fill 28.7 percent of all speaking roles in film.\n\n\u2014 28.3 percent of speaking characters in film and scripted series were minorities, 9.6 percent less than their proportion in the U.S. population.\n\n\u2014 2 percent of speaking characters were identified as LGBT.\n\n\u2014 In scripted series, less than 40 percent of all speaking characters were girls and women.\n\n\u2014 18 percent of all films and series were gender balanced; 8 percent of films were gender balanced.\n\n\u2014 Among characters 40 years of age older, 74.3 percent were men and 25.7 percent were women.\n\nBEHIND THE CAMERA\n\n\u2014 Only 3.4 percent of film directors were female out of 4,284 directors in film and scripted series.\n\n\u2014 87 percent of directors were white.\n\n\u2014 Among 6,421 writers, 71.1 percent were male and 28.9 percent were female.\n\n\u2014 77.4 percent of show creators in television and digital series were male; 28.9 percent were female.\n\n\u2014 Films and series with a female director had 5.4 percent more girls or women on screen than those directed by men.\n\n\u2014 Roughly 20 percent of corporate boards, chief executives and executive management teams were women.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE2LzAyL2FwLWRhbW5pbmctc3R1ZHktZmluZHMtYS13aGl0ZXdhc2hlZC1ob2xseXdvb2QuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Claire Z.
