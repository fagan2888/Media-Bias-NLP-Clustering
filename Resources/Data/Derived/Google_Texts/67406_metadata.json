Sure, that halted the legislative approval process in its tracks, but only until January, when a new Congress arrives and is sworn in. Republicans, who will have a majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, have pledged to bring it back for another vote in the next session.\n\nThe next vote may well bring a different result, but will the pipeline ever be built? That is something else altogether.\n\nRelated: Keystone XL Pipeline \u2014 No Oil, Plenty of Propaganda\n\nA lot has changed since TransCanada Pipelines first proposed building the nearly 1,200 mile-long extension to its existing pipeline network delivering Canadian crude oil to refineries in the Gulf Coast of Texas. The oil in question would come from the so-called oil sands projects in northern Alberta, ventures that high oil prices have made economically viable. The explosion in the oil sands developments has transformed Alberta\u2019s Fort McMurray into \u201cFort McMoney,\u201d a boom town where houses and salaries can be higher than those in Canada\u2019s largest city, Toronto \u2014 and where crime rates and drug usage rates are higher, too.\n\nThe extensive delays \u2014 prompted by the requirement that the U.S. government sign off on the project, since it crosses an international border, and the fierce battle waged by environmentalists to stop that from happening \u2014 have driven up the project\u2019s costs. TransCanada says building the Keystone link across Montana, South Dakota, and Nebraska would now cost some $8 billion, up from the originally estimated $5.4 billion, with shippers covering much of the additional charges.\n\nMeanwhile, oil prices are plunging, with Saudi Arabia clearly taking aim directly at Canada\u2019s oil sands projects as one of the chief threats to its global market dominance. The so-called sour crude that the Saudis are selling to the U.S., doesn\u2019t compete head-to-head with the light, sweet crude oil produced in Texas and Oklahoma. Rather, Saudi Arabia has taken aim at making Canadian oil sands output too costly in the American marketplace. That\u2019s why Saudi Arabia has initiated a price war, slashing prices to the U.S. and pressing OPEC to keep production at its current levels.\n\nRelated: This Is Where the Real Fracking Money Is\n\nTo the extent that shippers now would have to cover higher pipeline construction costs as well, that is going to make the Keystone project an increasingly unattractive venture from a purely economic perspective. Alberta oil sands producers \u2014 already operating the world\u2019s costliest wells \u2014 are bracing themselves for a drop in cash flow and earnings and may be preparing to cut their capital spending plans.\n\nThen there are the political considerations. The environmentalists aren\u2019t simply going to fold up their tents and go home if Congress does approve the pipeline (and overturns a likely presidential veto). There could still be a constitutional challenge, too. It would be a real test of whether the issue is one of foreign policy, and thus up to the administration, or foreign commerce, and thus appropriate for Congress to approve.\n\nBut the federal government isn\u2019t the last stop, either. Nebraska, in particular, has seen a tug of war over who has the right to give out the required approvals \u2014 the state governor or the state\u2019s Public Service Commission. Anyone who assumes that all the approvals are in the bag is probably indulging in some very wishful thinking.\n\nCanadian rocker Neil Young may whip up outrage about the pipeline, but what matters more is that landowners on the American side of the border \u2014 who vote those local politicians into office \u2014 still have anxieties about the project. Among these are indigenous communities like the Rosebud Sioux of South Dakota, who have declared that they will view the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline as an \u201cact of war.\u201d \u201cWe will close our reservation borders\u201d to the project, the tribe\u2019s president declared. Who really wants to go revisit that kind of conflict?\n\nThen, too, there is the fact that the United States probably doesn\u2019t need the oil, anyway. The shale oil production revolution has made the project less vital, and each year that passes without the pipeline being built makes it less likely that it will go forward, as the U.S. is able to more readily meet its refinery needs with domestic crude oil, produced and transported at a lower cost. True, it isn\u2019t free of controversy (fracking, anyone?) but even with the latest plunge in crude oil prices in the wake of last week\u2019s OPEC meeting, few plan to rein in their production.\n\nRelated: Oil Price Plunge Adds Pressure on Putin\n\nThe real question is how long those producers can continue to keep operating at a loss. For now, at least some will keep going, perhaps because they have sold forward their production at higher prices, or because they believe that in the giant game of chicken underway, the Saudis \u2014 with their aging wells and their need to enforce compliance among OPEC members \u2014 will give way first. Regardless, those domestic producers are still going to have a relative cost advantage over the far more expensive Canadian output.\n\nPut all that together, and it\u2019s a good bet that Keystone XL won\u2019t be built, but other pipelines will. They will link the new domestic shale oil and gas reserves with refineries, which will continue to operate. Canada\u2019s oil sands projects will continue to operate, and will continue to generate emissions. Some of the output will flow to U.S. markets through the existing Keystone pipeline; some will be shipped via rail (itself a far from environmentally benign solution), and some will be transported domestically in Canada. In the short term, lower oil prices mean that less is likely to be produced and transported, but the demise of Keystone XL isn\u2019t going to have a dramatic impact on climate change \u2014 unfortunately enough.\n\nUndoubtedly, a group of folks will clamor to claim credit for Keystone XL\u2019s defeat \u2014 whenever and however that becomes clear \u2014 but the reality is that it will be due to something fairly banal and yet inescapable: market forces.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Keystone XL Pipeline project is almost certainly dead.", "title": "Why the Keystone XL Pipeline Is Already Dead", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/12/03/Why-Keystone-XL-Pipeline-Already-Dead", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2012-07-30T084402Z_1_CBRE86T0BLB00_RTROPTP_2_KEYSTONE-DECISION2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/12/03/Why-Keystone-XL-Pipeline-Already-Dead", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2012-07-30T084402Z_1_CBRE86T0BLB00_RTROPTP_2_KEYSTONE-DECISION2.jpg", "creator": "@SuzMcGeeNYC", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Keystone XL Pipeline project is almost certainly dead.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The Keystone XL Pipeline project is almost certainly dead.\nRelated: Keystone XL Pipeline \u2014 No Oil, Plenty of PropagandaA lot has changed since TransCanada Pipelines first proposed building the nearly 1,200 mile-long extension to its existing pipeline network delivering Canadian crude oil to refineries in the Gulf Coast of Texas.\nPut all that together, and it\u2019s a good bet that Keystone XL won\u2019t be built, but other pipelines will.\nThe oil in question would come from the so-called oil sands projects in northern Alberta, ventures that high oil prices have made economically viable.\nSome of the output will flow to U.S. markets through the existing Keystone pipeline; some will be shipped via rail (itself a far from environmentally benign solution), and some will be transported domestically in Canada."}
