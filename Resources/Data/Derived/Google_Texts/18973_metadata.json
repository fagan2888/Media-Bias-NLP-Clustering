Janssen Biotech and Centorcor Biologics, App. No. 2013-1338, -1346 (Fed. Cir. , July 1, 2014) deserves more attention than it has received. (A copy of the decision is available at the end of this post.) The appeal was by Abbvie from a District Court decision entering a judgment of invalidity of Abbvie\u2019s patents on fully humanized antibodies (Abs) to IL-12. Although Abbvie won an interference involving its U.S. Patent No. 6,914,128, a jury found both patents invalid inter alia as failing the written description requirement (\u201cWDR\u201d) of s.112, para. 1.\n\nThe \u201cmodern\u201d WDR as created in UC v. Lilly and applied in decisions such as U. of Rochester v. Searle and Ariad v. Lilly has been a potent patent-killer, particularly when functional claims are asserted. That is just what Abbvie attempted, e.g.:\n\nClaim 29. A neutralizing isolated human antibody\u2026that binds to human IL-12 and disassociates from human IL-12 with a koff rate constant of 1\u00d710(-2)s(-1) or less, as determined by surface plasmon resonance. See slip. op p.7.\n\nAll you need to know about the accused product, Stelara, also a fully humanized Ab, and the Abs described in the patents in suit, is summarized in the Table on page 11. Every parameter is different, such as CDR Length, VH Family and Light Chain Type. While the \u2019128 patent had attempted to genericize the J695 and Joe-9 Abs, it did not mention changes in these parameters.\n\nJudge Lourie authored the opinion and it is clear that the WDR as defined en banc in Ariad is his baby, now fully grown. Simply pointing out and \u201cdistinctly circumscribe[ing]\u201d the outer boundaries of the territory enclosed by the \u201cperimeter fence\u201d of s.112, para. 1 is not sufficient per se to meet the WDR. In this case, Judge Lourie likens the species within the perimeter fence as a \u201chouse [built on] only in one corner of the plot\u201d:\n\n\u201d[I]f the disclosed species only abide in a corner of the genus, one has not described the genus sufficiently to show that the inventor invented, or had possession of, the genus. He only described a portion of it. That is the case here.\u201d Slip. op. at 23.\n\nDespite these homey images, the reader is left with little concrete guidance as to how many barns, guest houses and tool sheds must be built on patentee\u2019s plot of land in order for trespassers to be excluded. The Homestead Act of 1862 was clearer. We are left with language from Ariad: \u201c[No] bright line rules govern the number of species that must be disclosed to describe a genus claim, as this number necessarily changes with each invention, and it changes with progress in the field.\u201d\n\nAlthough it is well-settled that the WDR does not require actual reduction to practice of the representative species, and it may be possible to provide a correlation between common structural elements and function across the whole genus, I cannot recommend functional claiming, even in cases where your house has a species in every room. Judge Lourie\u2019s hostility to this type of claiming is palpable, even as he concedes that the infringing species need not be named:\n\n\u201cIt is true that Abbvie\u2019s patents need not describe the allegedly infringing Stelara in exact terms [Citing Lilly for the proposition that every species in a genus need not be named to meet the WDR]. However, patents must at least describe some species representative of antibodies that are structurally similar to Stelara\u2026.There is also no evidence to show whether one of skill in the art could make predictable changes to the described antibodies to arrive at other types of antibodies such as Stelara.\u201d\n\nBut what if Stelara was much closer in structure to the \u2019128 antibodies listed on the table mentioned above? Faced with the difficulty in occupying all the territory within a perimeter fence, would applicants be better off asserting infringement of claims to individual species or very focused generic claims under the doctrine of equivalents? Patentee might have better facts if it could be argued that Stelara or its ilk passed the function-way-result test for doe infringement. And patentee could not be faulted for failure to include an Ab in their application that was developed after its filing date. Now unpredictability works for patentee, and not as evidence that patentee could not support a generic claim. The doe has fallen into obscurity since Festo, but maybe a revival is overdue.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The recent decision in Abbvie Deutschland v.
