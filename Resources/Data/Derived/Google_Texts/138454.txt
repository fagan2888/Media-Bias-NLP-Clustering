A 25-year-old man plowed his white Volkswagen Jetta through the guardrail on Grandview Avenue in Mt. Washington midday Saturday, plummeting about 100 feet down the steep hillside.

An eight-member rescue crew used rope linked to a fire truck's aerial ladder and two telephone poles to hoist the victim — who was conscious and able to give a thumbs-up signaling he was OK — onto Grandview where the road bends near Shaler Street.

Several witnesses who saw the vehicle go over the hillside called 911 about 12:15 p.m., Pittsburgh Emergency Medical Services District Chief Amera Gilchrist said.

The four-door sedan came to a stop wedged against several trees, narrowly missing a gap to the right that could have sent the vehicle tumbling toward a trail and railroad tracks at the base of the hill.

“He is very lucky,” Gilchrist said. “He was alert and oriented ... and scraped up pretty good, but pretty stable.”

Police did not release the name of the man, who they believe fell asleep at the wheel. No skid marks were visible on the street.

He climbed out of the vehicle on his own, then with assistance made it up to a ledge from which rescuers put a harness around him to lift him off the hillside and onto a stretcher. He was taken to UPMC Mercy, Uptown, for treatment.

“Unless there's a fire or you're in immediate danger, it's best to stay in the vehicle and let our paramedics and rescue crews rescue you,” Gilchrist said. “He could've risked falling further down the hill ... and potentially cost him his safety and the safety of our personnel.”

About 15 feet of the turquoise guardrail overlooking the Ohio River and Downtown was ripped out. Public works crews expected to put up safety barricades.
