The visual evidence came when Kheva pulled his hand away and Dragolovich continued to drum, stopping in rhythm with other Park View patients.\n\n\u201cThe drumming kind of roused him and brought him back,\u201d said Jennifer Raymond, director of rehabilitation at Park View. \u201cWhat\u2019s left is what\u2019s important not what\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nNo ordinary drum circle, the exercise at Park View echoes the increased use of musical activities in senior homes and care facilities across Sonoma County and the country to rouse or engage those who can no longer communicate with words.\n\nThe efforts make use of new technology, including iPods, to revive old tunes and trigger memories for dementia patients and others with debilitating mental conditions. Family members often are enlisted in the music-making ensembles with their own instruments or through dance.\n\nThe music programs are part of a larger shift in U.S. health care, driven in part by President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, that is geared toward assessing the success of institutions such as hospital and skilled nursing facilities by patient satisfaction and quality of life.\n\nThe Park View drumming program, called Rhythmic Abilities in Dementia, is part of an extensive music program at the Santa Rosa nursing home. The goal is not simply entertainment but to improve the well-being of patients with behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia.\n\nStaff members at the 116-bed skilled nursing facility on Montgomery Drive are quick to point to the peer-reviewed scientific and medical research to support the efforts. In one study, by a team from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, such exercises are categorized as \u201cdiversional activities.\u201d\n\nDrumming \u201cis a form of music therapy that relies on the fundamental subcortical levels of the brain,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cIt does not need a melody or require following a song; it\u2019s basis is rhythm, which is a primal sense of life and movement.\u201d\n\nThe study, published this year in the Journal of Gerontological Nursing, goes on to say that the act of drumming increases participation among those with severe dementia and decreases withdrawal and social isolation, while the rhythm produced can reduce anxiety.\n\nThe drumming exercise is based on a music therapy and wellness program developed by percussion instrument giant Remo. Mostly known for their popular drum set head, Remo created a series of specialized drums for the program and provides the training for places like Park View.\n\n\u201cOur brains are hardwired for music,\u201d said Alyssa Janney, who manages Remo\u2019s HealthRhythms program. Janney said organizations like Park View are \u201ctransforming the quality of life of the people they service. It\u2019s not just something that makes them happy. We actually know from the science that they\u2019re transforming the quality of life.\u201d\n\nA second music-related program at Park View, called Music Together Intergenerational Program, brings moms and their children together in a lively, music-making session. Kids of all ages dance and make music.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rehab tech Keane Kheva gently took Elmer Dragolovich\u2019s left hand and helped", "story version": 2016, "og": {"site_name": "Santa Rosa Press Democrat", "description": "The drum circle at a Santa Rosa nursing home echoes the increased use of musical activities in care facilities across the country to engage those who can no longer communicate with words.", "title": "Program with drum maker Remo offers new outlet for Santa Rosa nursing home residents", "url": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/3905968-181/program-with-drum-maker-remo-offers", "image": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=rCetkUnwNiaF4oOuJGY6qs$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYtiUSDG1S2kb3g2MMUb2$HJWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100003031242373, "app_id": 125780984227497}, "msvalidate.01": "9E66801B649686495190ABE3DA8985E7", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressdemocrat", "published_time": "2015-05-10T18:17:00-08:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The Park View drumming program, called Rhythmic Abilities in Dementia, is part of an extensive music program at the Santa Rosa nursing home.\nThe visual evidence came when Kheva pulled his hand away and Dragolovich continued to drum, stopping in rhythm with other Park View patients.\n\u201cThe drumming kind of roused him and brought him back,\u201d said Jennifer Raymond, director of rehabilitation at Park View.\nBut despite outward appearances, Dragolovich, a resident at Park View Post Acute nursing home in Santa Rosa, was, according to medical experts, likely experiencing some fundamental brain activity triggered by music.\nMostly known for their popular drum set head, Remo created a series of specialized drums for the program and provides the training for places like Park View."}
