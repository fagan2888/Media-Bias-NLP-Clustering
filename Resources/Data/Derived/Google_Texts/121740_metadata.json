In the closing days of the campaign, the Republican attorney general in Virginia essentially framed the race as a referendum on President Barack Obama\u2019s unpopular health-care law, which has been rocked by a messy roll out over the last month.\n\n\u201cPerhaps my greatest disappointment in this year\u2019s race is simply that the truth wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d Cuccinelli wrote on his Facebook page Tuesday. \u201cI know that sounds simple, and there\u2019s a lot more to campaigns than being substantively better than the other side, but I\u2019ve always trusted that truth counts for something\u2026 a lot actually.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact, I think just a few more days of the truth of ObamaCare raining down on Virginians would have done the trick,\u201d Cuccinelli added. \u201cBut it was not to be, at least not for us, not in 2013.\u201d\n\nCuccinelli promised to go into more detail about the election at a later date.\n\n\u201cWhile I will have more to say about the election later, I didn\u2019t want too much time to go by without saying a heartfelt \u2018thank you\u2019 to all of you that did so much to help me fight to win this year\u2019s governor\u2019s race,\u201d he wrote.\n\nFollow Alex on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Pappas", "description": "Republican argues he would have won the race", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Republican Ken Cuccinelli told his supporters Tuesday that he thinks he would have won the Virginia gubernatorial race had Virginians been exposed just a little bit more to the \"truth\" of Obamacare be", "title": "Cuccinelli: I just needed \u2018a few more days of the truth of ObamaCare\u2019", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/12/cuccinelli-i-just-needed-a-few-more-days-of-the-truth-of-obamacare/", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-11-06T010915Z_1_CBRE9A5039M00_RTROPTP_4_USA-POLITICS-VIRGINIA-e1383771926344.jpg", "height": 344}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republican argues he would have won the race", "title": "Cuccinelli: I just needed \u2018a few more days of the truth of ObamaCare\u2019 Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/12/cuccinelli-i-just-needed-a-few-more-days-of-the-truth-of-obamacare/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-11-06T010915Z_1_CBRE9A5039M00_RTROPTP_4_USA-POLITICS-VIRGINIA-e1383771926344.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-12 15:51:56", "sailthru.title": "Cuccinelli: I just needed 'a few more days of the truth of ObamaCare'", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "obamacare,virginia,alex-pappas", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "elections 2013,ken cuccinelli,obamacare,virginia", "sailthru.description": "Republican Ken Cuccinelli told his supporters Tuesday that he thinks he would have won the Virginia gubernatorial race had Virginians been exposed just a little bit more to the \"truth\" of Obamacare be", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-11-06T010915Z_1_CBRE9A5039M00_RTROPTP_4_USA-POLITICS-VIRGINIA-e1383771926344.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3cb4\"", "article_summary": "3960725Republican Ken Cuccinelli told his supporters Tuesday that he thinks he would have won the Virginia gubernatorial race had Virginians been exposed just a little bit more to the \u201ctruth\u201d of Obamacare before they voted.\n\u201cPerhaps my greatest disappointment in this year\u2019s race is simply that the truth wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d Cuccinelli wrote on his Facebook page Tuesday.\nCuccinelli narrowly lost the contest last week to former Democratic National Committee Chairman and moneyman Terry McAuliffe.\n\u201cI know that sounds simple, and there\u2019s a lot more to campaigns than being substantively better than the other side, but I\u2019ve always trusted that truth counts for something\u2026 a lot actually.\u201d\u201cIn fact, I think just a few more days of the truth of ObamaCare raining down on Virginians would have done the trick,\u201d Cuccinelli added.\n\u201cBut it was not to be, at least not for us, not in 2013.\u201dCuccinelli promised to go into more detail about the election at a later date."}
