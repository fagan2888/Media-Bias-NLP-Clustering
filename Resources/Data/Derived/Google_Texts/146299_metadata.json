Seventeen-year-old Lauren Bush, who has just admitted to torturing the boy, committed the unthinkably cruel crime in March alongside a 15-year-old girl.\n\nThe Maryland teenage girls were originally charged with two counts of first-degree assault, two counts of second-degree assault, soliciting child pornography, and false imprisonment. Investigators discovered the girls made the autistic boy, who will remain unnamed because of his age, masturbate and have sex with a family pet. They recorded it on their cellphones and also held a knife to his throat, kicked his groin, dragged him around by his hair, and made him walk across a thinly frozen pond. When he fell through the ice twice, they did nothing to help him.\n\n\u201cHis vulnerabilities made this crime more heinous,\u201d St. Mary's Sheriff Tim Cameron told SoMdNews. Cameron added that the alleged offenses were one of the most disturbing crimes he had ever seen.\n\nOn May 29, Bush pled guilty before a St. Mary\u2019s County judge to second-degree assault and distribution of an obscene video. She has since been sent to an out-of-state secure facility where she\u2019ll remain until the court determines her release.\n\nWhen the boy came home, his mother asked him why his clothes were wet and he told her he walked onto the pond on his own with no provocation from the girls. When the teens were arrested, Bush was going to be tried as an adult with several counts of assault, but after reevaluation, the courts decided a juvenile prosecution would be more appropriate given her age. The other girl is being charged as a juvenile, and her name is being withheld.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a good judge of people,\u201d the mother told The Washington Post in March. \u201cI keep trying to talk to him about it, but it\u2019s hard to get much out of him. I\u2019ll say, \u2018This is what so-and-so told me, and I know this happened,\u2019 but he\u2019ll act like, \u2018Oh, [the girls] were just playing around.\u2019 He didn\u2019t deny anything. I am trying to make him understand that people are talking about this all over TV, but he wanted to go to school today.\u201d\n\nSince Bush was charged in a juvenile court, she will be released before she turns 21. That\u2019s less than four years from the date of prosecution.\n\nAfter the girls were arrested, the boy\u2019s mother asked him: \u201cYou\u2019re going to stay away from these girls, right? You don\u2019t plan on hanging out with them again, right?\u201d He answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "maryland, teen, lauren, bush, sent, secure, facility, after, allegedly, torturing, boy, autism", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Lauren Bush pleaded guilty three months after physically and sexually torturing a 16-year-old autistic boy.", "title": "Teen Girl Sent To Secure Facility For Sexually Abusing Autistic Classmate", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/maryland-teen-lauren-bush-sent-secure-facility-after-allegedly-torturing-boy-autism-286854", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/06/maryland-teen-tortures-autistic-boy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lauren Bush pleaded guilty three months after physically and sexually torturing a 16-year-old autistic boy.", "title": "Teen Girl Sent To Secure Facility For Sexually Abusing Autistic Classmate", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/maryland-teen-lauren-bush-sent-secure-facility-after-allegedly-torturing-boy-autism-286854", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/06/maryland-teen-tortures-autistic-boy.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/06/maryland-teen-tortures-autistic-boy.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-06-06T13:12:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-06T13:12:03-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Lauren Bush pleaded guilty three months after physically and sexually torturing a 16-year-old autistic boy."}, "article_summary": "\u201cHe\u2019s not a good judge of people,\u201d the mother told The Washington Post in March.\nSeventeen-year-old Lauren Bush, who has just admitted to torturing the boy, committed the unthinkably cruel crime in March alongside a 15-year-old girl.\nThe Maryland teenage girls were originally charged with two counts of first-degree assault, two counts of second-degree assault, soliciting child pornography, and false imprisonment.\nShe has since been sent to an out-of-state secure facility where she\u2019ll remain until the court determines her release.\nInvestigators discovered the girls made the autistic boy, who will remain unnamed because of his age, masturbate and have sex with a family pet."}
