(iStock/The Washington Post/iStock/The Washington Post)\n\nTo many, buying insurance for your car, home or life seems like a big waste of money.\n\nWhat if you never get into an auto accident? Although most states require auto liability insurance, people nonetheless grouse about all that money doled out over the years. Or what if you never make a claim against your home insurance policy? That\u2019s money gone too, they grumble.\n\nAnd chances are you\u2019re going to live a long life.\n\nBut like it or not, insurance is often necessary because most of us can\u2019t self-insure against financially catastrophic events.\n\nStill, lots of people have to be persuaded \u2014 when the law or a contract such as a mortgage doesn\u2019t force the issue \u2014 to buy insurance. Such is the case of a reader who wrote me during one of my online discussions. She\u2019s at a loss as to how to prove to her husband that they need life insurance.\n\nTheir background: They are in their early 30s with two young children. He is the main income earner. She works part time from home and cares for their children.\n\nThe mortgage is their only debt. \u201cEmergency savings and retirement are in decent shape, although I would like to be saving even more,\u201d the wife wrote. \u201cWe definitely aren\u2019t living paycheck to paycheck, but don\u2019t have much monthly wiggle room for \u2018extras.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe wife\u2019s argument for life insurance: \u201cI feel strongly that we both need it,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI think we just need enough money to be able to afford to pay the mortgage and child care for a couple of years.\u201d Life insurance would give the surviving spouse a chance to regain footing and make a more permanent game plan, she said.\n\nThe husband\u2019s argument against life insurance: \u201cHe says he doesn\u2019t want to pay a premium for something we are highly unlikely to ever need. He thinks that if one of us passed away, the other would just need to \u2018deal with it\u2019 as best we could.\u201d And by \u201cdeal with it,\u201d the husband\u2019s plan is that the surviving spouse would sell the house and move out of state to be with family who would help with child care, she wrote.\n\nI asked Steven Weisbart, senior vice president and chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, to weigh in on what he would tell the husband.\n\n\u201cMy first reaction is that \u2018deal with it\u2019 isn\u2019t a plan,\u201d Weisbart said. \u201cInsurance is for rare but financially crushing events; because they\u2019re rare, the premium is affordable and if the event insured-against does happen, financial disaster is avoided, and the road to recovery is faster and smoother,\u201d Weisbart said he would tell the husband.\n\nOkay, what about selling the house?\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know anything about the current house, but under the pressure of a post-death sale, it would likely fetch less than under more favorable selling conditions, particularly if there are some defects that couldn\u2019t be fixed quickly and cheaply,\u201d Weisbart said.\n\nBut the wife could go back to work, right?\n\n\u201cIf [the husband] dies, she would immediately have new expenses,\u201d Weisbart said. \u201cShe would need to transition from a part-time to full-time earner plus begin paying for child care.\u201d\n\nWeisbart had other questions for the husband:\n\n\u25cfDoes he have health insurance through his employer? \u201cIf so, the cost of successor coverage could be a substantially greater expense,\u201d Weisbart said.\n\n\u25cfAre there tasks that he performs for the couple that she would have to hire people to do after his death?\n\n\u25cfAre living costs near the out-of-state family higher or lower than where they live now?\n\n\u25cfWould the wife need to pay for school or a training program to boost her employment skills? How much would this cost?\n\n\u25cfWould she ultimately be able to replace the income he earns?\n\n\u25cfAs for child care, has the family who would provide it agreed to do so, and are they \u2014 financially, physically, etc. \u2014 in a position to do that? (People promise a lot of things they don\u2019t or can\u2019t follow through on. Just saying.)\n\n\u25cfIf his wife dies, would he move with the kids to be nearer to family, and would he have to switch jobs? If so, would he have to take a salary cut to find employment in the new location?\n\n\u201cI think that it would be helpful for each of them to have life insurance, at least to help manage what I call transition expenses,\u201d Weisbart said. \u201cAt their ages, it would be very cheap, particularly if they bought 20-year term policies.\u201d\n\nI hope the couple live a long and prosperous life. But hoping is not a plan.\n\nGet this message on Instagram\n\nReaders may write to Michelle Singletary at The Washington Post, 1150 15th St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20071 or michelle.singletary@washpost.com.
