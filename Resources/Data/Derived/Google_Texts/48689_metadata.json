Patrice Arent, D-Millcreek, said she was going to introduce a resolution that, if passed, would put GOP Gov. Gary Herbert\u2019s Healthy Utah Medicaid expansion plan before Utah voters this November.\n\nLater, she said her idea had morphed, and she wanted to put some kind of extensive Medicaid expansion before voters \u2013 but not necessarily Herbert\u2019s.\n\nHowever, Arent has not formally introduced such a resolution \u2013 perhaps not wanting to further antagonize the majority House Republicans who have already voted to reduce the minority\u2019s influence on two key legislative committees.\n\nShe did introduce a bill outlining how such non-binding questions would be handled.\n\nHowever, she has not introduced a resolution (it\u2019s still in the drafting stages) that would actually put a Medicaid expansion question before voters.\n\nIn any case, UPD pollster Dan Jones & Associates finds overwhelming support for Arent\u2019s idea of having voters, at least, show their willingness to expand Medicaid for Utah\u2019s poorest, sickest citizens.\n\nJones\u2019 latest survey sees 72 percent support putting Medicaid expansion on November\u2019s ballot.\n\nTwenty-one percent oppose such a citizen referendum, and 6 percent don\u2019t know.\n\nGiving citizens a vote on Medicaid expansion is favored across the political spectrum:\n\nUtah Republicans favor the M/E vote, 71-23 percent, with 7 percent undecided.\n\nDemocrats really like the idea of a vote, 84-11 percent, with 6 percent undecided.\n\nAnd political independents favor the vote, 74-22 percent, with 4 percent undecided.\n\nHughes, R-Draper, has said many times that full Medicaid expansion under Obamacare is too expensive for the state and that even Herbert\u2019s Healthy Utah plan could very well commit the GOP Legislature to future costs that can\u2019t be born.\n\nA public vote on expansion is not needed, Hughes told UtahPolicy, because the Legislature is going to act this session.\n\nMedicaid expansion is a sore point for House Republicans and Hughes, all being hammered publicly the last two years by media and various pro-expansion groups, who maintain that the 90-10 financial split of Obamacare expansion will bring hundreds of millions of dollars into the state \u2013 not to mention greatly helping poor sick people.\n\nDunnigan, R-Taylorsville, came up with HB437 this session, which would cost the state a bit less in money, but which would only bring a 70 percent federal match while covering 16,000 of the neediest.\n\nHerbert says he will gladly sign the bill, and hopes that in the future \u2013 maybe under a new U.S. president \u2013 the feds will agree to a 90-10 split or some other change, and Utah can expand Medicaid aid to more of Utah\u2019s needy.\n\nJones polled 625 Utahns Feb. 10-15. The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.92 percent.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Almost three-fourths of Utahns want the chance to vote on Medicaid expansion come this November\u2019s ballot, a new UtahPolicy poll finds.", "generator": "Joomla! - Open Source Content Management", "author": "Bob Bernick", "og": {"url": "http://utahpolicy.com/index.php/features/today-at-utah-policy/8755-poll-majority-of-utahns-want-to-vote-on-medicaid-expansion", "type": "article", "image": "http://utahpolicy.com/images/articles/Utah_State_Capitol_23.jpg", "site_name": "utahpolicy.com", "title": "Poll: Majority of Utahns Want to Vote on Medicaid Expansion"}, "google-site-verification": "lihgswQmNHE4uzDhVlR0Saxekx4JgwwjFYC6fjhIvCM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Almost three-fourths of Utahns want the chance to vote on Medicaid expansion come this November\u2019s ballot, a new UtahPolicy poll finds.\nGary Herbert\u2019s Healthy Utah Medicaid expansion plan before Utah voters this November.\nGiving citizens a vote on Medicaid expansion is favored across the political spectrum:Utah Republicans favor the M/E vote, 71-23 percent, with 7 percent undecided.\nJones\u2019 latest survey sees 72 percent support putting Medicaid expansion on November\u2019s ballot.\nLater, she said her idea had morphed, and she wanted to put some kind of extensive Medicaid expansion before voters \u2013 but not necessarily Herbert\u2019s."}
