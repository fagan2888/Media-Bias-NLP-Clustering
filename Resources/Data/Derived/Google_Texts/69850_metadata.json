(AP) - The owner of a Minot clothing store is putting together what she refers to as a multi-million dollar clothing line that will free women from a daily battle between their wardrobe and their bodies.\n\nChappy Windsor, 36, has had several pieces made exclusively for her to sell at her store called Dakota Chappy, the Bismarck Tribune (http://bit.ly/1L28gpb ) reported. Windsor has gotten offers to dress celebrities in her garb, but would rather focus on everyday women, she said.\n\nWindsor is aiming to help women of all ages who struggle with their clothing and self-image in a world with impossible beauty standards.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Dakota girl, and my total vibe is with the women here: They have genuine taste, and they know quality and function. The brand name doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she said.\n\nOne creation called the \u201cTotal Tight\u201d is a one-piece, full-body tight that gives women more support and allows them to forgo wearing a bra or panties, according to Windsor.\n\n\u201cThis is both inner and outwear. Why should you suffer?\u201d she asks. \u201cBut the bra support situation is very, very personal. The push-up bra pushes tissue into the d\u00e9colletage and takes the dance out of the collarbone. With too much push, most tops don\u2019t drape right.\u201d\n\nWindsor has sold 4,000 individual Total Tights, and not dozens at wholesale, she said.\n\nOther pieces include the \u201cTotal Jean\u201d and \u201cTotal Jegging.\u201d Her trademark \u201cSleeve Solution\u201d attempts to address what she called the \u201cbat wing,\u201d loose skin on the back of an arm, which Windsor thinks is mainly a body issue in the upper Midwest.\n\n\u201cOther women don\u2019t even think about that. Here, we\u2019re so modest and so covered for 10 months out of the year, that uncovering induces anxiety,\u201d she said.\n\nWindsor believes that women shouldn\u2019t be tortured by their clothing. She hopes her clothing line will someday be sold everywhere.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Bismarck Tribune, http://www.bismarcktribune.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "The owner of a Minot clothing store is putting together what she refers to as a multi-million dollar clothing line that will free women from a daily battle between their wardrobe and their bodies.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/14/nd-store-owner-works-to-build-clothing-line-for-wo/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "The owner of a Minot clothing store is putting together what she refers to as a multi-million dollar clothing line that will free women from a daily battle between their wardrobe and their bodies.", "title": "ND store owner works to build clothing line for women"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "The owner of a Minot clothing store is putting together what she refers to as a multi-million dollar clothing line that will free women from a daily battle between their wardrobe and their bodies.", "card": "summary", "title": "ND store owner works to build clothing line for women"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "MINOT, N.D.
