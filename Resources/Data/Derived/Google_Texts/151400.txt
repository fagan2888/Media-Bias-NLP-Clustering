Authorities say a skydiving student has died and an instructor was injured in a tandem jump in Arizona.

Pinal County Sheriff's spokesman Mark Clark says a malfunction or failure occurred, leading to a hard-impact landing during the jump Saturday morning in Maricopa.

Firefighters responding to the scene pronounced the student dead.

Clark says the second person, an instructor at Skydive Phoenix, was hospitalized with two broken legs.

Skydive Phoenix operates a drop zone for skydivers in Maricopa, about 34 miles south of Phoenix.

According to a post on the company's Facebook page, the female student was conducting her second jump for their Accelerated Skydiving Program and a main parachute did not deploy.

The Federal Aviation Administration is also investigating.
