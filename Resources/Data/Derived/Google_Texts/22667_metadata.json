This will have dire and cataclysmic consequences for the world.\n\nThis is an administration that lives in a constant state of denial and routinely disguises its trail of catastrophic policy failures by wrapping it up in Orwellian double-speak. They simply change the definition of success by either changing the metric of assessment or by changing the terminology.\n\nIt\u2019s called lying.\n\nPresident Obama decided to prematurely withdraw from Iraq for no other reason than politics. The artificial deadline for withdrawal was not determined for strategic goals but rather for a political one \u2014 his reelection timetable. Everyone, including his own advisors, warned him of the disastrous consequences of his actions.\n\nHere\u2019s what the president said in 2011:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s harder to end a war than begin one. Indeed, everything that American troops have done in Iraq \u2014 all the fighting and all the dying, the bleeding and the building, and the training and the partnering \u2014 all of it has led to this moment of success.\u201d\n\nHe called the world more secure.\n\n\u201cBecause of you, we are ending these wars in a way that will make America stronger and the world more secure.\u201d\n\nBut because of this administration\u2019s policies, Iraq\u2019s success was short lived and the world is less secure.\n\nThose same voices are warning of larger, more complicated problems if he continues to allow this cancer of terrorism to spread without engaging it more aggressively. The events that are now taking place in Iraq were all foreseen. The president chose not to listen because his political campaign was more important than any strategic campaign to stabilize Iraq.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder this administration can call the war on ISIS a success. To this president, words are meaningless; they are just an accessory used as smoke to conceal his overtly political misconduct.\n\nWhen this administration declared an end to \u201cthe Global War on Terror\u201d by simply calling it an \u201cOverseas Contingency Operation\u201d and then abolished terrorism by simply calling it a \u201cman-caused disaster,\u201d they got it half right. It\u2019s pretty clear now that this administration and its \u201coverseas contingency operations\u201d are both \u201cman-caused disasters.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This is part of an occasional series by IBD\u2019s two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist in which he explains the thinking behind his latest political cartoon.\n\nCheck out more Ramirez cartoons here.\n\nFollow Michael Ramirez on Twitter: @Ramireztoons.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Presidential spokesperson Josh Earnest characterized the White House ISIS strategy as an \"overall success.\" The obvious follow-up question should have been, for", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Presidential spokesperson Josh Earnest characterized the White House ISIS strategy as an \u201coverall success.\u201d The obvious follow-up question should have been, for whom?
