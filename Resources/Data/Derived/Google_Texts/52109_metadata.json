Randy Neugebauer, R-Lubbock, in 2016. By Monday, eight candidates had filed for a spot on the March 2016 primary ballot.\n\nThe three join former Texas Tech Vice Chancellor Jodey Arrington, Lubbock banker and realtor Greg Garrett, retired surgeon Donald May, Lubbock Mayor Glen Robertson and Col. Michael Bob Starr, who all hosted campaign kickoff events prior to the filing period.\n\nCorley is a 32-year-old farmer, the owner of an online retailer and an oil field consultant. He grew up near Lubbock and went to Lubbock-Cooper High School, graduated from West Texas A&M University and now lives in Lynn County with his wife and two children.\n\nCorley described himself as a tea party candidate, and said he\u2019s running for Congress because he\u2019s tired of not seeing any change in the federal government.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m watching how the federal government is directly affecting my pocket book,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a millionaire or a senior citizen, which is typically who runs. We need to have some change. I have a stake in the future of this country.\u201d\n\nAs a farmer, he said, his crop insurance went up 300 percent from 2014-15 because of the Farm Bill. As an online business owner, he said he\u2019s spending about $800 a month on a family of four because of the Affordable Care Act. And as someone who does work in the oil field, he said he\u2019s seen jobs lost that he said could be fixed if leaders lift a ban on oil exports.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d want somebody in there that would actually represent me, that\u2019s actually in the same boat as me,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to elect someone that represents us. Would you rather elect a guy that has two kids, a mortgage that costs less than his healthcare premium, that\u2019s hoping social security will still be around and is worried about the future because he\u2019s raising his two kids in it, or some bank owner?\u201d\n\nCorley discussed some of his priorities if elected, which include repealing the Affordable Care Act, fixing the Farm Bill, passing a balanced budget, returning as much power to the states as possible and protecting religious rights.\n\nHe also said he\u2019d support all pro-life legislation, work to secure the borders, set term limits for all members of Congress and lift the ban on oil exports from the U.S.\n\nCorley said he\u2019ll start hitting the campaign trail after Thanksgiving, during which he\u2019ll set up meet-and-greets with voters over coffee.\n\nA-J Media reached out to Mehaffey and Parrish for comments but did not receive a response.\n\nFiling for the Congressional District 19 race continues until Dec. 14.\n\nmatt.dotray@lubbockonline.com\n\n\u25cf 766-8744\n\nFollow Matt on Twitter\n\n@mdotrayAJ", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Filed online, Local News, MATT DOTRAY", "og": {"site_name": "Lubbock Online | Lubbock Avalanche-Journal", "description": "The filing period for a place in the  Texas U.S. House District 19 race began last Saturday, and alongside the candidates who have already announced are a few new faces.", "title": "Jason Corley among 3 new congressional candidates, filing continues", "url": "http://lubbockonline.com/filed-online/2015-11-23/jason-corley-among-3-new-congressional-candidates-filing-continues", "image": "http://lubbockonline.com/sites/default/files/14918333.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "The filing period for a place in the \u00a0Texas U.S. House District 19 race began last Saturday, and alongside the candidates who have already announced are a few new faces.Jason Corley of Lynn County, Samuel Mehaffey of Abilene and Don Parrish of Plains joined the list of candidates running for the seat being vacated by U.S. Rep.
