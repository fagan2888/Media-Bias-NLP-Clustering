Why do you think marketers use free stuff to bring people in? Free stuff is such a strong marketing ploy,\" Palin said. \"But didn't you all learn too in Econ 101 there ain't no such thing as a free lunch? Our free stuff today is being paid for by taking money from our children and borrowing from China.\"\n\nPalin continued, \"When that note comes due -- and this isn't racist.. but it's going to be like slavery when that note is due. We are going to be beholden to a foreign master. Because there is no plan coming out of Washington, D.C. to stop the incurrence of debt.\"\n\nWatch a clip of Palin's remarks above.\n\nPalin has previously invoked slavery in criticizing President Barack Obama and his policies. In March 2012, she told Fox News' Sean Hannity that Obama is \"bringing us back...to days before the Civil War, when unfortunately too many Americans mistakenly believed that not all men were created equal.\"\n\n\"What Barack Obama seems to want to do is go back to before those days when we were in different classes based on income, based on color of skin,\" she said.\n\nDuring the Iowa speech, Palin also took her fellow Republicans to task for not standing behind the party's conservative wing during the government shutdown fight over the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"Remember their promise that they would do everything in their power to fight against socialized medicine, against Obamacare?\" Palin said. \"When it came time to stand and defund it, they waved the white flag of surrender and they threw under the bus the good guys who did stand up and fight.\"\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Top Palinisms Top Palinisms\n\n1 of 15 Final Words \u201cNuclear weaponry, of course, would be the be-all, end-all of just too many people in too many parts of our planet.\u201d -- CBS interview with Katie Couric, September 25, 2008 Share this slide:\n\nAP", "article_metadata": {"description": "Speaking at a conservative fundraiser in Iowa on Saturday evening, former Alaska governor and Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-11-11 12:01:53 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Speaking at a conservative fundraiser in Iowa on Saturday evening, former Alaska governor and Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin", "title": "Sarah Palin Compares Federal Debt To Slavery", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/10/sarah-palin-debt-slavery_n_4250896.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1454342/images/o-PALIN-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Speaking at a conservative fundraiser in Iowa on Saturday evening, former Alaska governor and Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin", "creator": "molliereilly", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1454342/images/o-PALIN-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Sarah Palin Compares Federal Debt To Slavery", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-10 12:01:53 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4250896", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "iowa,sarah palin slavery,Politics News,video,Sarah Palin GOP,sarah palin iowa,sarah palin debt,sarah palin federal debt,sarah palin,sarah palin debt slavery,sarah-palin", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "iowa,sarah palin slavery,Politics News,video,Sarah Palin GOP,sarah palin iowa,sarah palin debt,sarah palin federal debt,sarah palin,sarah palin debt slavery,sarah-palin", "published_time": "2013-11-10 12:01:53 -0500", "modified_time": "2013-11-11 11:01:08 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "Our free stuff today is being paid for by taking money from our children and borrowing from China.\"\nWhy do you think marketers use free stuff to bring people in?\n\"This free stuff, so seductive.\nFree stuff is such a strong marketing ploy,\" Palin said.\nThe Des Moines Register's Jennifer Jacobs reports that Palin, speaking at the Iowa Faith & Freedom Coalition's fall fundraiser, warned of the allure of \"free stuff\" offered by the government."}
