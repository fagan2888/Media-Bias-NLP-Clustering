The only reason Democrats win elections is they are willing to lie, mislead and steal their way to victory. They offer heaping upon heaping of manure covered with buttercream icing to thunderous applause from the Progressive left.\n\nTo the far-left, perception is reality. It\u2019s about making a good impression. They are all about glitz and chasing shiny objects\u2026superficiality\u2026shallowness.\n\nThey\u2019ll say anything to further their cause, and their bedfellows in the mainstream media reflexively give them a pass. That\u2019s why Democrats got away with telling lies to pass Obamacare. That\u2019s how IRS leadership got away with targeting conservatives. That\u2019s why Hillary Clinton escaped the Benghazi mess and thus far her classified email debacle.\n\nWith common sense and logic abandoned, these radicals live in a made up world where right is wrong and wrong is right.\n\nConsider this recent quote for example: \u201c\u2026Republicans are essentially the party of a monolithic view that is narrow-minded that says, \u2018Let\u2019s take this country backwards\u2019,\u201d said the national committee chairperson of the party offering voters a homogenous group of five elderly, ghostly-white presidential contenders with tried and tired ideas that have never worked and never will.\n\nStanding in stark contrast are the remaining GOP candidates, an impressive group of youthful, multi-ethnic presidential candidates with fresh ideas (save a few duds).\n\nSome say liberalism is a mental disorder. I would go a step further to suggest it is a condition of the heart. A sin-sickness.\n\nOne cannot live in a perpetual state of denial of the truth of God\u2019s Word and be whole and healthy humans. It\u2019s impossible. That\u2019s why they repeatedly accuse conservatives of the very things of which they themselves are guilty.\n\nThey accuse conservatives of imposing their morality on others, yet fail to see the contradiction of their own words and deeds.\n\nWith threat of lawsuit or jail time, they vociferously demand conservatives bake their wedding cakes and officiate weddings or fund their birth control and Planned Parenthood abortions. They went bonkers after a clerk in Kentucky who refused to sign same-sex marriage licenses but had no problem whatsoever when a lesbian judge in Texas refused to perform heterosexual marriages.\n\nThey think law-abiding Americans can\u2019t be trusted with guns, then somehow manipulate logic to say it\u2019s a good idea to entrust a rogue, blood-thirsty regime like Iran with nukes. They blame a gun when a man is killed with a gun but go stark-raving mad and blame a man when he uses a gun to kill a lion.\n\nThey rage against greed yet demand government handouts.\n\nThey insist the rich don\u2019t pay their fair share of taxes but overlook rich tax-evading fellow Democrats like Al Sharpton.\n\nThey despise capitalism and sing the praises of communism, something which seems to work so remarkably well that people do their best to escape it on a regular basis.\n\nThey loathe the filthy rich and say Republicans are selfish capitalists but have raised the filthy and rich Hillary Clinton to be their frontrunner.\n\nHonestly, American politics stinks but it\u2019s the only process we have to make important decisions for millions of people holding diverse and conflicting opinions. America saw politics at its best during the days of the Reagan and Gingrich Revolutions when leaders worked together for the better good.\n\nBut somewhere between then and now, the Democrat Party jettisoned its principles and moved so far left they\u2019d have a tough time finding mainstream America even with it standing front-and-center.", "article_metadata": {"msvalidate.01": "6F0F769B18C1F1E5145E5D36120FA2DD", "google-site-verification": "Z9m9q_xL4Yy_Msowqv-zI38cEeVjdxTAdaVjki3tOdU", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailysunnews.com/news/2015/oct/21/inmates-are-running-asylum/", "type": "article", "title": "The inmates are running the asylum"}, "viewport": "width=1020", "description": "After watching the first Democrat Party presidential debate, one can understand why the Democrat National Committee has chosen to limit their presidential debates to just six."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd969c\"", "article_summary": "GUEST COLUMNAfter watching the first Democrat Party presidential debate, one can understand why the Democrat National Committee has chosen to limit their presidential debates to just six.\nThey loathe the filthy rich and say Republicans are selfish capitalists but have raised the filthy and rich Hillary Clinton to be their frontrunner.\nThey insist the rich don\u2019t pay their fair share of taxes but overlook rich tax-evading fellow Democrats like Al Sharpton.\nBut somewhere between then and now, the Democrat Party jettisoned its principles and moved so far left they\u2019d have a tough time finding mainstream America even with it standing front-and-center.\nThe only reason Democrats win elections is they are willing to lie, mislead and steal their way to victory."}
