As of today, the financial liability for any fraud involving credit and debit cards with old school magnetic strips will fall on the party that hasn\u2019t updated to the \u201cchip\u201d technology championed by the EMV (Europay, MasterCard and Visa) coalition \u2014 whether that\u2019s the provider that issued the card or the merchant where the customer swiped the card. Prior to the transition, the liability cost was borne by the card provider. The chips inside EMV cards send a unique verification code each time they\u2019re used, whereas magnetic strip cards send the same code each time. That means with EMV cards, hackers can\u2019t create phony versions of cards by stealing their codes from point of sale machines at retail stores and restaurants.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCard providers have been sending new chip cards to customers across the U.S. as transition day approaches. According to data provided by Visa, as of Sept. 15, 151.8 million Visa chip cards had been issued in the U.S. and more than 314,000 merchants have set up chip-equipped payment terminals. Both numbers have surged in the past year, Visa said. According to a MasterCard statement, 40 percent of all U.S. MasterCard-branded cards are now chip-enabled. There was a 446 percent increase in MasterCard chip transitions between August 2014 and August 2015, the company said.

By working together to prevent and disrupt threats to our digital infrastructure, America can continue pioneering new discoveries and expanding the boundaries of humanity\u2019s reach.\u201d\n\nHAPPY THURSDAY and welcome to Morning Cybersecurity! This switcheroo from an Edward Snowden to an \u201cEdward Scissorhands\u201d discussion on HLN is outstanding: http://usat.ly/1L4nzjI.

Shortly after, State Department Cyber Coordinator Chris Painter will take questions at a forum on \u201cThe Future of America\u2019s Cyber Strategy\u201d hosted by the Christian Science Monitor\u2019s Passcode. Expect some tough questions at both events on the White House\u2019s recent no-economic-hacking agreement with China. Nunes and Schiff were both lukewarm about the deal when it was announced Friday, saying they\u2019ll wait to see if China complies. Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work defended the deal at a House Armed Services Committee hearing Wednesday, calling it a \u201cconfidence building measure\u201d and evidence that cyber deterrence is working.

The idea is for companies selling alternate ways for computers users to digitally identify themselves to take up the framework as a means of ensuring industry-wide interoperability, as well as the security and privacy of users. Online firms that embrace it will self-certify their offerings and can display a trust mark showing their adherence. The steering group was set up by the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace, a NIST-managed effort that\u2019s been protected by administration officials and congressional allies from House Republican appropriators\u2019 annual attempts to defund it.

Jim Lewis from the Center for Strategic and International Studies said administration officials had told him just that. Lewis also said his contacts told him that there was a debate within the administration about how or whether to punish China over the Office of Personnel Management breach. White House officials settled on the threat of sanctions as the \u201cmiddle course,\u201d and that threat made clear to China that \u201cwe were mad about this,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nCHINESE SPOKESPERSON SIDESTEPS QUESTION ON NEW OPM STORY \u2014 A spokesperson for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry didn\u2019t directly answer a question Wednesday about a Washington Post report that the CIA pulled personnel from Beijing after the big Office of Personnel Management breach. \u201cThe Chinese government firmly opposes and cracks down on all forms of hacking activities in accordance with the law,\u201d said Hong Lei, who shifted the focus to the U.S.-China agreement. From the Foreign Ministry website: http://bit.ly/1iMkTvU The Post story: http://wapo.st/1iJEugs\n\n** A message from Northrop Grumman: Today\u2019s enemy threats have taken on forms like never before.

Japan and the United States in April struck a series of agreements that included cyber cooperation and a commitment to voluntary cyber norms. Both countries can claim to be victims of organized, state-sponsored attacks by China. And Japan\u2019s National Police Agency last month said that targeted cyberattacks in their country had increased sevenfold in the first half of 2015 compared to last year. http://bit.ly/1KMDQs5 Background on the U.S.-Japan agreements: http://politico.pro/1OHg7NJ\n\nHILLARY\u2019S EMAIL INSECURITY PROBLEMS (MAYBE) DEEPEN \u2014 Yet more of the Hillary Clinton private server emails have been slapped with the \u201cclassified\u201d label, POLITICO\u2019s Josh Gerstein and Nick Gass report. The same cache revealed that she received spearphishing emails from Russia relying on a speeding ticket hoax. The latter is barely smoke, let alone fire; if there\u2019s evidence that she clicked on them, that\u2019s a different matter. \u201cAll these emails show is that, like millions of other Americans, she received spam,\u201d said campaign spokesman Nick Merrill. http://politi.co/1KRkOyF And a story on emails from one of her advisers on cyber predictions: http://politico.pro/1JEupHh\n\nDoD IG: MOST CYBER RECOMMENDATIONS UNRESOLVED \u2014 Over the course of a one-year period ending July 31, the Defense Department resolved 93 pre-existing cyber recommendations contained in unclassified DoD and Government Accountability Office audits. The bad news is that department management left 136 unresolved, according to a DoD inspector general summary out Wednesday. \u201cReports issued during the reporting period most frequently cited cybersecurity weaknesses in the categories of risk management, identity and access management, and contingency planning,\u201d according to the summary. The full report was labeled \u201cFor Official Use Only\u201d and not released publicly. http://bit.ly/1RgytUf\n\nCYBERCRIME BILL READY FOR THE HOUSE FLOOR \u2014 Two panels, House Judiciary and House Homeland Security, signed off Wednesday on legislation that formally authorizes the National Computer Forensics Institute, a Secret Service/Alabama Office of Prosecution Services-run facility that trains state and local officials to go after cybercrime. \u201cThe Strengthening State and Local Cyber Crime Fighting Act of 2015 is a much-needed bill that will help law enforcement fight back against increasingly sophisticated cybercrimes,\u201d said its sponsor, Rep. John Ratcliffe. Ratcliffe and Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte called on the House to take up the bill on the floor. The Homeland Security panel approved legislation sponsored by Rep. Cedric Richmond requiring the Department of Homeland Security to develop a cybersecurity strategy.

Google security engineer James Forshaw announced his discovery of the flaws earlier this week, and they\u2019ve already been patched in VeraCrypt, a version of TrueCrypt. But the bugs don\u2019t affect the security of TrueCrypt encryption itself, said John Hopkins University cryptologist Matthew Green in an interview with Motherboard. \"Instead, the bug poses a problem for the system it is being run on,\" Motherboard notes. Green led a code audit of TrueCrypt that earlier this year found no evidence of deliberate backdoors in the code. TrueCrypt\u2019s anonymous developers suddenly abandoned upkeep of the project in May 2014, despite its popularity.

DOT said in a Sept. 9 letter that \u201cmodifying motor vehicle software can create safety and cybersecurity risks.\u201d Our friends at Morning Technology have more on another letter on the same subject from the Environmental Protection Agency, and how the letters are annoying copyright reform activists.
