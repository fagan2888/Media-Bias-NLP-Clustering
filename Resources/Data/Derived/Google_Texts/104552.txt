This week’s Big Picture features a tapestry that combines American Indian and LEGO brick art.

Artist Dave Shaddix’s version of the pictorial textile Angry Birds Tree of Life by Navajo artist Marlowe Katoney is the centerpiece of an exhibit at the Heard Museum in Phoenix called BUILD! Toy Brick Art, on display through September.

“Although I’ve built kachina dolls with LEGOs before, they received mixed feedback in Hopi villages,” Shaddix says. “But this show was the first time I had a chance to convert a living artist’s work, taking his vision and medium and transforming it into something completely new, a 70-by 80-inch toy brick mosaic. I redrew original weaving, pixel by pixel, on my computer, creating over 50 ten-inch sections, which were ultimately assembled by 60 awesome volunteers who turned the concept into a creation. Something this size would typically take me a month to build alone, but the volunteers built it in three hours. I had a blast watching the textile artist react, and interact, with the LEGO-ized version.”
