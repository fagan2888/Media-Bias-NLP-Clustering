Sales within Optum's OptumRx pharmacy benefit manager, which helps payers negotiate drug prices and patients take their medicine correctly, also improved, increasing 11% from a year ago.\n\nLeveraging scale\n\nInsurance is unequivocally an industry of scale, and as premium revenue jumps because of membership growth, more sales are finding their way to the bottom line.\n\nSo far, fear that Obamacare would imperil UnitedHealth's profitability because of the enrolling of sick patients, rising healthcare utilization, and fees and taxes, have been unrealized.\n\nThanks to pricing schemes that are offsetting headwinds, UnitedHealth Group's net margin was 4.4% exiting June, up slightly from the year before -- a year in which UnitedHealth pitched Obamacare plans in only a handful of states.\n\nBecause pricing and patient health have tracked within the company's expectations, the consolidated company's EPS grew 15% to $1.64 last quarter, and that puts it nicely on track to deliver on its guidance for full-year EPS of at least $6.25. If so, then it could also be in fine shape to deliver on industry watchers' EPS forecast of $7.36 next year.\n\nLooking forward\n\nIf you're wondering whether UnitedHealth's sales and profit winning streak can continue, you might want to consider that 10% of Americans remain without health insurance, according to the CDC.\n\nWhile that's a 4% improvement from 2007, it also means that there are tens of millions of people that could still end up becoming customers of UnitedHealth and its peers in the future; especially since penalties associated with not having health insurance are set to at least double this year before jumping again in 2016.\n\nCouple Obamacare tailwinds with potential growth tied to the graying of America and the rising embrace of analytics throughout healthcare, and you have a winning combination that could suggest owning UnitedHealth as a core component in long-haul portfolios. If so, then this could be the right time to pick up shares.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "07:41", "date": "2015-09-14T11:41:00Z", "description": "Rising demand tied to Obamacare and aging seniors has sales and profit soaring at this big insurer.", "ResponsiveALP": "1Ses_2things-v-single_2-things_50", "author": "Todd Campbell", "promo": "Rising demand tied to Obamacare and aging seniors has sales and profit soaring at this big insurer.", "twitter": {"site": "@themotleyfool", "description": "Rising demand tied to Obamacare and aging seniors has sales and profit soaring at this big insurer.", "title": "Are UnitedHealth Group's Shares on Sale? --  The Motley Fool"}, "tags": "Yahoo,Google Editor's Pick", "og": {"site_name": "The Motley Fool", "description": "Rising demand tied to Obamacare and aging seniors has sales and profit soaring at this big insurer.", "title": "Are UnitedHealth Group's Shares on Sale? --  The Motley Fool", "url": "http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/09/14/are-unitedhealth-groups-shares-on-sale.aspx", "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F179072%2Funitedhealth2.JPG&h=630&w=1200&op=resize", "type": "article"}, "headline": "Are UnitedHealth Group's Shares on Sale?", "fb": {"admins": 50808187550, "page_id": 7240312795, "app_id": 50808187550}, "bureau": "usmf-health-care", "STORY_UID": "c7e7a670-58a9-11e5-b9c8-0050569d32b9", "pitch": 2518, "msvalidate.01": "8D40D58712924715BAA79D135A6C8DDA", "gsa_date": "2015 09 14", "tickers": "UNH", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Thanks to pricing schemes that are offsetting headwinds, UnitedHealth Group's net margin was 4.4% exiting June, up slightly from the year before -- a year in which UnitedHealth pitched Obamacare plans in only a handful of states.\nDemand for UnitedHealth's insurance plans has been soaring following the implementation of Obamacare in 2013, and as a result, membership in UnitedHealth plans climbed by 1.6 million people in the past year.\nWhile Obamacare has been a big driver of UnitedHealth's membership increase, older and longer-living baby boomers are fueling the company's revenue growth, too.\nLooking forwardIf you're wondering whether UnitedHealth's sales and profit winning streak can continue, you might want to consider that 10% of Americans remain without health insurance, according to the CDC.\nThe company makes most of its money from its insurance plans, which raked in $33.1 billion (yes, billion) in premium revenue in the second quarter, up 10% year over year."}
