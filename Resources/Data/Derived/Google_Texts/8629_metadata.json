Chris Christie (R-N.J.) on Friday pledged to be a charmer of a president, dispensing airplane rides and chocolate gifts to recalcitrant Democrats in order to win their votes.\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi would be on Air Force One every time she turns around,\u201d Christie said of his tactical approach to Hill outreach. \u201cCome on Nancy. Let\u2019s go take a ride. Take the M&M\u2019s. It will be fun, I don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m president, I will be given the greatest tools to be able to do this that anybody has had in their life, the greatest home field advantage ever,\u201d Christie added. \u201cYou have the White House, Camp David, Air Force One, Marine One, if you can\u2019t persuade somebody to do something with all that, you are in the wrong business. Right now I\u2019m just doing it on my charm and good looks for God\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\nChris Christie, political seductress, is not an image that quickly comes to mind for those who best know him as the brash, insult-spewing, truth-telling Republican governor of a Democratic-leaning state. And indeed, it\u2019s not exactly the image that Christie has been cultivating in recent days on the trail, where he has made his best attempt to rip the political flesh off Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) after the Senator\u2019s unexpectedly strong third-place finish in the Iowa Caucus.\n\nChristie still had tough words for Rubio at Friday\u2019s stop at the Timberland factory in Stratham, New Hampshire -- accusing the senator of being in over his head when it comes to potentially running the country.\n\nBut the tone of the town hall was decidedly geared towards presenting Christie as collaborative, not combative. And for a governor squeezed between an unapologetic wing of his party\u2019s candidates and several other moderate governors, it seemed like a tactical readjustment in the closing days of the New Hampshire primary.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Get ready for chocolates and airplane rides, Leader Pelosi", "sailthru.expire_date": "2016-02-06 15:16:25 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Get ready for chocolates and airplane rides, Leader Pelosi", "title": "Chris Christie Will Charm The Hell Out Of Nancy Pelosi As President", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-christie-president_us_56b4f621e4b01d80b24629b8", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/56b4f6671a00002d00ab219b.jpeg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Get ready for chocolates and airplane rides, Leader Pelosi", "title": "Chris Christie Will Charm The Hell Out Of Nancy Pelosi As President", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/56b4f6671a00002d00ab219b.jpeg", "height": 1000}, "creator": "@samsteinHP", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-02-05 15:16:25 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_56b4f621e4b01d80b24629b8", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Chris Christie,Nancy Pelosi,chris christie president,christie campaign,2016 campaign,New Hampshire Primary", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Chris Christie,Nancy Pelosi,chris christie president,christie campaign,2016 campaign,New Hampshire Primary", "published_time": "2016-02-05 15:16:25 -0500", "modified_time": "2016-02-05 15:16:25 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "\u201cNancy Pelosi would be on Air Force One every time she turns around,\u201d Christie said of his tactical approach to Hill outreach.\nChris Christie (R-N.J.) on Friday pledged to be a charmer of a president, dispensing airplane rides and chocolate gifts to recalcitrant Democrats in order to win their votes.\nBut the tone of the town hall was decidedly geared towards presenting Christie as collaborative, not combative.\nIt will be fun, I don\u2019t care.\u201d\u201cIf I\u2019m president, I will be given the greatest tools to be able to do this that anybody has had in their life, the greatest home field advantage ever,\u201d Christie added.\nRight now I\u2019m just doing it on my charm and good looks for God\u2019s sake.\u201dChris Christie, political seductress, is not an image that quickly comes to mind for those who best know him as the brash, insult-spewing, truth-telling Republican governor of a Democratic-leaning state."}
