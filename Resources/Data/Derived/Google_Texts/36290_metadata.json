Even without much penetration outside China, Alibaba.com is already the world\u2019s biggest online retailer. Its annual sales are a staggering $248 billion \u2014 more than Amazon and eBay combined. When Alibaba started trading on the NYSE last month, its founder, Jack Ma, instantly became China\u2019s richest man.\n\nThe fable Alibaba is named for isn\u2019t just a story about treasure, though. It\u2019s a saga of wealth based on theft. And while almost all the recent commentary on Alibaba.com has focused on unimaginable bounty, the banditry aspects of the folktale may have some resonance for Alibaba investors as well.\n\nThe giddy gold-rush mindset gripping Wall Street in the run-up to the record-setting Alibaba IPO represents a spectacular victory for the Chinese variant of state-controlled \u201ccommand\u201d economics \u2014 a triumph made all the more amazing by the Cayman Island shell company shadow play America\u2019s captains of finance were willing to tolerate to get their piece of the Alibaba pie. When the dust cleared, the NYSE had helped Alibaba raise $25 billion dollars \u2014 an amount so huge that the underwriting commissions alone came to $300 million.\n\nIt would be remarkable for any foreign company to launch such a successful IPO in the heart of American finance. For Alibaba \u2014 an e-commerce entity whose very existence is subject to the whims and patronage of the ruling and nominally Communist Chinese bureaucracy, and whose IPO gives every appearance of having been carefully (and clandestinely) stage-managed to benefit a wide swathe of China\u2019s ruling elite \u2014 snatching such an important \u201cfree market\u201d crown is a stunning and seemingly self-contradicting feat, one that highlights aspects of our own financial system that could be considered both economically and politically perverse.\n\nThis was actually Alibaba\u2019s second IPO, not that most of the reporting mentioned it. The first, in 2007, was on the Hong Kong exchange. (The stock from this initial initial public offering was bought back by Alibaba in 2012, in anticipation of the current investor blitz.) This may come as a surprise even to dedicated China watchers, because Hong Kong has been defined in the recent press almost solely by its having \u201clost out\u201d on the current Alibaba IPO as a result of its strict \u201cone share, one vote\u201d governance requirement for all listed companies \u2014 a policy designed to protect small investors.\n\nIn the run up to Alibaba\u2019s second IPO, the company asked Hong Kong for an exemption, allowing it to retain its current and somewhat shadowy partnership system, under which a small group of stakeholders can select the majority of the company\u2019s directors without controlling a majority of its shares. Hong Kong refused to bend its regulations. So Alibaba\u2019s second IPO was made on the NYSE.\n\nSetting aside the irony that a Chinese stock exchange has stronger rules for protecting shareholder democracy than the American one, it should be pointed out that there\u2019s nothing inherently sinister about a \u201cdual-class\u201d stock system. (Or, rather, that there\u2019s nothing more than usually sinister inherent in it.) As AP business writer Kelvin Chan has pointed out, American tech titans, including Facebook and Google, empower a privileged class of stockholders by a similar mechanism. Like freedom itself in the old patriotic cliche, American corporate governance practices aren\u2019t free.\n\nHowever, what matters more than the undemocratic shareholder structure Alibaba fled to New York to preserve is an as-yet-unanswerable question: Whose control is Alibaba protecting, exactly?\n\nAnd here\u2019s where things get interesting \u2014 and worrisome.\n\nDespite the general impression that Alibaba just made a U.S. stock offering, not one share in Alibaba itself has been sold through the New York Stock Exchange. This is because foreigners are not allowed to own even a scintilla of a major Chinese company without permission from the Chinese government.\n\nTo skirt this problem, Alibaba created a shell company called Alibaba Group Holding Limited, headquartered in that offshore financial laundromat favored by both Mitt Romney and the Medellin cartel: The Cayman Islands.\n\nShares in the Cayman-based Alibaba Group are what just set an IPO record. Despite their high price, they are essentially profit participation vouchers. They confer no participation in Alibaba governance, and indeed no actual ownership of Alibaba, causing one financial wag to refer to Alibaba Group buyers as potential \u201cstuckholders.\u201d\n\nThere are actual owners of Alibaba stock though. They include Yahoo, the wounded giant of American tech, who got in early, and whose corporate history in China includes turning compromising electronic data about journalist and democratic activist Shi Tao over to the Chinese authorities, leading directly to Shi\u2019s torture and his imprisonment as a political criminal for eight and a half years. According to a 2008 report by Amnesty International, \u201cYahoo has cited its relationship with Alibaba \u2026 to explain its lack of ability to resist government requests for information,\u201d though Yahoo says it has reformed its Chinese information sharing practices somewhat over time.\n\nAs an \u201cangel\u201d investor, Yahoo was able to purchase 40 percent of Alibaba in 2005 with the Chinese government\u2019s blessing, for the bargain basement price of $1 billion. It was a deal Alibaba founder Jack Ma allegedly came to resent, and he reportedly worked to countermand it.\n\nIn 2012, at least 50 percent of Yahoo\u2019s Alibaba stock, or a 20 percent stake in Alibaba, was bought back, in a $7.6 billion deal financed in large measure by a coalition of China\u2019s government-operated sovereign wealth fund and three Chinese investment firms. According to a DealBook expose in the New York Times, these three financial firms had a few salient commonalities: deep political connections, and a preponderance of Communist \u201cprincelings\u201d (i.e., sons and grandsons of the two dozen men who have served on China\u2019s elite Politburo Standing Committee since 2002) within their executive ranks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Alibaba's glorious emergence in America is the product of a system designed to benefit the very few", "title": "The dangerous truth about Wall Street\u2019s favorite new company", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Alibaba's glorious emergence in America is the product of a system designed to benefit the very few", "title": "The dangerous truth about Wall Street\u2019s favorite new company", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/12/the_dangerous_truth_about_wall_streets_favorite_new_company/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/alibaba_ipo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Alibaba's glorious emergence in America is the product of a system designed to benefit the very few", "title": "The dangerous truth about Wall Street\u2019s favorite new company", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/alibaba_ipo.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "R.
