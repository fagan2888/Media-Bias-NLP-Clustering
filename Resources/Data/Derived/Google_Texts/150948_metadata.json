Register your health insurance\n\n2014 is the first year you\u2019ll face a penalty if you don\u2019t have health insurance. It\u2019s one of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare.\n\n\"I do foresee a lot of individuals coming in and not being aware of that they have to have coverage 9 out of 12 months for 2014,\" said Moye.\n\nYou could be fined $95 for not having coverage and it goes up from there depending on your income.\n\nIf you have health insurance through the marketplace, you should have received a \"1095-A\" form to prove you have coverage.\n\nOn your 1040 form, line 61 is what you\u2019ll need to find to confirm your insurance.\n\n2. If you got hacked, let the IRS know\n\nFlorida is a hotbed for identity theft. If you had your information stolen or think it may have been at risk, you can let the IRS know. It\u2019s an extra layer of protection.\n\nFind the document here.\n\n3. Deduct clothes as an itemized expense\n\nWhether you\u2019re a lawyer wearing a suit, an AC repairman wearing a t-shirt and shorts or a lifeguard wearing shorts - we all buy clothes for work. But you can only deduct work clothes if you cannot wear your clothes in a normal situation outside of work.\n\n4. Child care expenses\n\nMoye says this could be the biggest change to the amount you get back, but many people don\u2019t realize it. He says you could lower your taxable income and increase your refund by hundreds if you calculate how much you spent in child care in 2014. You\u2019ll need you child care provider\u2019s tax ID number.\n\n5. Increase IRA contributions\n\nYou can contribute up to $5,500 this year and that's up from last year. That\u2019s pre-tax money, so don\u2019t shortchange yourself.", "article_metadata": {"isStory": "true", "isPremium": "false", "description": "By now you've received your W-2's from your employer and are rounding up paperwork to file your taxes.
