If a new applicant\u2019s income for the current month is below the threshold \u2014 roughly $1,300 for an individual or $2,700 for a family of four \u2014 they qualify for Medicaid until their income changes, according to Vermont Health Connect spokesman Sean Sheehan.\n\nThe person profiled in the VTDigger report lost his job and employer-sponsored health insurance mid-year. By that point he had received close to $100,000 in compensation. Sheehan said that using monthly income is a federal rule, and he did not know the policy justification.\n\nWhen the individual in question applied for health insurance through Vermont Health Connect, he automatically qualified for Medicaid. As an individual without employer-sponsored insurance, he had no choice but to apply for coverage through the health care exchange. Vermont is the only state that does not allow individuals to purchase insurance outside the exchange.\n\nHowever, VHC provides applicants the option of purchasing a plan without checking their eligibility for premium subsidies or Medicaid, officials said.\n\nIn November, the person went to renew coverage for the coming year and, still without income, remained on Medicaid.\n\nAround that time, he went into business for himself, and had additional earnings in December. That income likely makes him ineligible for Medicaid, and he will have to purchase health insurance before the end of VHC\u2019s open enrollment period Feb. 15.\n\nPeople who apply for health insurance through Vermont Health Connect are also asked to submit their projected annual income. That allows people with variable income, such as seasonal laborers, to set the expectation that they will be eligible for the full year. The purpose is to reduce the churn of people on and off the program, Sheehan said.\n\nRegardless of one\u2019s projected income, any change in actual earnings must be reported to VHC within 10 days, he said.\n\nHowever, reporting an income change, or any change to coverage or personal information, is not quick or easy through the exchange, which has carried a backlog of such requests for the entire year.\n\nVHC and its contractors were unable to complete an automated change function for the Web portal, so changes must be reported to call center workers and manually keyed in by VHC workers.\n\nThis week, VHC placed a change request form on its website that can be submitted online, Sheehan said, but those changes must still be entered manually. A fully automated option for changes is expected to be completed in April or May, according to VHC officials.\n\nThe self-reported income and personal information on coverage applications must be checked against a federal database. At the end of January, VHC had close to 12,000 individuals whose Medicaid eligible income had not been verified.\n\nThat number continues to grow, likely due to new applicants entering the system. A Feb. 9 internal memo shows the number of people with unverified Medicaid income was 13,502.\n\nVermont suspended regular Medicaid eligibility redeterminations in August 2013. The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has approved the state\u2019s plan to wait until April to resume them. State officials have said they expect beneficiaries to come off the program when the process begins again, but would not hazard a guess as to how many.\n\nTrinka Kerr, the state\u2019s lead Health Care Advocate for Vermont Legal Aid, said she\u2019s more concerned about people who are eligible for Medicaid who aren\u2019t receiving benefits because of problems with the exchange.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Man who earned $100,000 but lost his job was entitled to Medicaid through Vermont Health Connect.", "og": {"site_name": "VTDigger", "description": "Man who earned $100,000 but lost his job was entitled to Medicaid through Vermont Health Connect.", "title": "Medicaid rules allow high-income people to temporarily receive benefits | VTDigger", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Medicaid.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-15T07:22:22+00:00", "url": "http://vtdigger.org/2015/02/12/medicaid-rules-allow-high-income-people-temporarily-receive-benefits/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Man who earned $100,000 but lost his job was entitled to Medicaid through Vermont Health Connect.", "creator": "@true_morgan", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Medicaid.jpg?fit=800%2C600", "title": "Medicaid rules allow high-income people to temporarily receive benefits | VTDigger", "site": "@vtdigger", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/vtdigger", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "Vermont Health Connect", "published_time": "2015-02-12T15:27:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-15T07:22:22+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "medicaid, vermont health connect, health exchange, obamacare, vermont, vermont news, vermont events, vermont press releases"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc64d\"", "article_summary": "When the individual in question applied for health insurance through Vermont Health Connect, he automatically qualified for Medicaid.\nA Feb. 9 internal memo shows the number of people with unverified Medicaid income was 13,502.\nPeople who apply for health insurance through Vermont Health Connect are also asked to submit their projected annual income.\nA recent VTDigger article highlighted the case of a high-income person who spent much of 2014 on Medicaid, a government health insurance program meant for the needy and disabled.\nThe person profiled in the VTDigger report lost his job and employer-sponsored health insurance mid-year."}
