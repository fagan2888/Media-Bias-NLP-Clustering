Hodges, striking down state laws prohibiting same-sex marriage, the amendment would prevent the government from punishing wedding-service vendors \u2014 such as florists, bakers and churches \u2014 who conscientiously object to taking part in same-sex weddings.\n\nPro-LGBT groups said the amendment will legally sanction discrimination against gay people.\n\n\u201cLaws that promote discrimination are anti-democratic, harm Missouri families, and \u2014 as we\u2019ve learned in Indiana \u2014 are bad for our economy,\u201d said Jeffrey Mittman, executive director of the ACLU of Missouri. \u201cThat is why so many Missourians, including clergy and business leaders, strongly oppose any effort \u2014 such as SJR 39 \u2014 that would seek to enshrine inequality in our Missouri Constitution.\u201d\n\nProponents of the measure say it does not broadly allow refusal of service to gay people. They contend religious individuals and organizations should not be coerced into violating their consciences.\n\n\u201cNo one should be compelled to make a work with their own hands that\u2019s offensive to their beliefs,\u201d state Sen. Bob Onder, who introduced the legislation, told the Kansas City Star.\n\nThe Senate has historically been reluctant to use the \u201cprevious question\u201d rule, in which a simple majority can end filibusters and force a vote. The amendment still needs to be approved by the Senate one more time before proceeding to the statehouse.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans in the Missouri Senate have passed a constitutional amendment protecting religious individuals and businesses who do not want to service same-sex wedding ceremonies, bringing to end a 39-hour filibuster over the measure by Senate Democrats.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Republicans in the Missouri Senate have passed a constitutional amendment protecting religious individuals and businesses who do not want to service same-sex wedding ceremonies, bringing to end a 39-hour filibuster over the measure by Senate Democrats.", "title": "Missouri religious liberty amendment passes; filibuster ends after 39 hours", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/9/missouri-religious-liberty-amendment-passes-filibu/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/08/religious_objections.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/08/religious_objections.jpeg", "description": "Republicans in the Missouri Senate have passed a constitutional amendment protecting religious individuals and businesses who do not want to service same-sex wedding ceremonies, bringing to end a 39-h", "card": "summary", "title": "Missouri religious liberty amendment passes; filibuster ends after 39"}, "Author": "Bradford Richardson", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues, Senate"}, "article_summary": "Republicans in the Missouri Senate have passed a constitutional amendment protecting religious individuals and businesses who do not want to service same-sex wedding ceremonies, bringing to end a 39-hour filibuster over the measure by Senate Democrats.\nA rarely used procedure known as the \u201cprevious question\u201d rule was used to cut off debate on Wednesday morning, after which Senate Joint Resolution 39 passed by a 23-9 vote.\nThe Senate has historically been reluctant to use the \u201cprevious question\u201d rule, in which a simple majority can end filibusters and force a vote.\nThe amendment still needs to be approved by the Senate one more time before proceeding to the statehouse.\nThey contend religious individuals and organizations should not be coerced into violating their consciences."}
