Mt. Juliet is positioning itself to land large-scale employers to new industrial locations on the north side of Interstate 40 that officials say will bring a significant number of jobs to the county.

Mayor Ed Hagerty declined to say what companies the city is having discussions with, but said at least two are prominent potential employers.

“Everyone will know who they are,” Hagerty said. “(It’s) a potential user that would have several hundred jobs, so we’re very interested in making that a reality.”

The city commission is in the process of preparing the way for large-scale warehouse type use.

Just over 63 acres north of I-40 near Beckwith Road has been approved for rezoning to an industrial use that would allow warehousing goods, transport and storage. The majority owner of the property is Jack Lowery, a prominent Lebanon attorney, who confirmed ongoing negotiations with representatives of a large company looking at several places.

Lowery is under a confidentiality agreement not to discuss the potential buyer. He described negotiations as “more than talk, but not definite.”

Mt. Juliet has also approved one reading to rezone about 210 acres near the Lowery property along I-40 known as Beckwith West, to the same industrial use. Beckwith West would extend from the Beckwith Farms industrial area.

The city commission has approved first reading with second and final reading expected July 14.
