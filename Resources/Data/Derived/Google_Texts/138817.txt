TELLURIDE, Colo.—Authorities say a 28-year-old man was accidentally shot to death by a fellow hunter during an outing near the tiny community of Egnar in southwestern Colorado.

The Telluride Daily Planet reports ( http://bit.ly/194yKbp) Trenten Tyler Sutherland was shot in the head while hunting coyotes with two companions the night of Dec. 27. The accident happened on Sutherland’s parents’ property, and investigators say the group was using an optical device known as an illuminator, which highlights animals’ eyes in darkness.

San Miguel County Sheriff Bill Masters says the group became separated and one of the hunters was using the device with a rifle when he apparently mistook Sutherland’s eyes for those of a coyote.

Egnar is an unincorporated community about 50 miles west of Telluride near the Utah-Colorado border.
