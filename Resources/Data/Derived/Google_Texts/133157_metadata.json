If anyone should understand the need for guns in this country, it\u2019s someone with a connection to the Holocaust. And Michigan lawmakers passed that rape insurance bill.\n\nBaker Would Rather Go to Jail Than Make Gay Wedding Cake\n\nIt\u2019s official, the gays have finally killed capitalism. And freedom. In a segment titled, \u201cThe Death of Free Enterprise,\u201d Fox and Friends spotlighted the plight of one poor Colorado baker who was just told by a judge that his \u201creligious freedom\u201d does not give him the right to refuse to sell a cake to a same sex couple for their wedding. Masterpiece Cakeshop owner Jack Phillips was sued last year when he refused to sell Dave Mullins and Charlie Craig a wedding cake. Though Phillips insisted that he does not discriminate against gay customers in general and would gladly sell them any other baked goods, the presiding judge didn\u2019t buy it, pointing out that \u201cOnly same-sex couples engage in same-sex weddings. Therefore, it makes little sense to argue that refusal to provide a cake to a same-sex couple for use at their wedding is not \u2018because of\u2019 their sexual orientation.\u201d This is obviously an outrage and worthy of an entire Fox News segment. \u201cThis certainly could set precedent in terms of private businesses having to completely shed what they believe personally to offer something to a consumer,\u201d warned host Elisabeth Hasselbeck. Phillips attorney, Nicolle Martin, went on to suggest that, \u201cif the government can force you to violate your beliefs under the threat of a jail sentence there\u2019s really no freedom they can\u2019t take away.\u201d Phillips has also said he\u2019d be willing to go to jail before selling a wedding cake to a gay couple.\n\nIf a Descendent of Holocaust Survivors Doesn\u2019t Get the Need for Guns, Who Will?\n\nNational Rifle Association board member Scott Bach is just totally perplexed by Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop\u2019s initiative to hold gun vendors accountable for who they sell to in order to encourage gun safety. Not only was Fulop in the Marines, his grandparents were in the Holocaust, \u201cso you\u2019ve got to wonder why he is not getting it,\u201d Bach said during an interview with NRA News this week. The inaccurate Holocaust argument\u2014that Germany\u2019s strict gun control laws allowed for Hitler\u2019s rise to power\u2014is a favorite for gun rights advocates.\n\nKathleen Sebelius Is Like a (South) Korean Dictator\n\nRepublican Rep. John Shimkus really put his foot in his mouth during a House Energy & Commerce Health Subcommittee hearing this week. Getting heated over Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius\u2019s argument that preventative services on health care premiums under Obamacare would not, as Shimkus suggested, increase health care expenses for beneficiaries, Shimkus tried to compare Sebelius to a North Korean dictator. But he fumbled his words and, instead, said that arguing with her was \u201clike talking to the Republic of Korea or something.\u201d The Republic of Korea is another name for South Korea, an American ally. North Korea is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n\nA Personal Tale of Sexual Assault Doesn\u2019t Appeal to Rape Insurance Proponents\n\nRemember last week when we spotlighted a citizen-proposed law in Michigan that would require women to purchase separate insurance plans to cover abortions, even in cases of rape and incest, because those atrocities are like car accidents, for which every woman should always be prepared? Well, Michigan\u2019s State Senate Minority Leader Gretchen Whitmer tried desperately to prevent the bill from passing, calling it \u201cone of the most misogynistic proposals\u201d and \u201ctruly despicable.\u201d She even took to the Senate floor and tearfully revealed that she was raped 20 years ago. \u201cAs I was considering what to say in opposition to the rape insurance proposal in front of the Senate today, I made the decision to speak about my own story publicly for the first time every,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve coped with privately for many years now, but I felt it was important for my Republican colleagues to see the face of the women they\u2019re hurting with their actions today.\u201d Unfortunately, Whitmer\u2019s moving and brave statement was for naught: the bill was approved anyway.\n\nGays Just Want to Get Married for Better Benefits for Their AIDS Treatments", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "CEDickson"}, "keywords": "u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201312151045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "What kind of country are we living in when a baker can\u2019t refuse to make a gay wedding cake without facing a lawsuit?
