Burwell case challenging the subsidies that are key to Obamacare\u2019s existence.\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com\n\nObama also said he was confident the court would not rule against his administration. Obama, Napolitano said, was trying to strong-arm co-equal branch of government.\n\n\u201cHe cannot intimidate them, they have lifetime tenure!\u201d Napolitano said.\n\nHe noted that with the Supreme Court\u2019s docket drawing to a close, the decision in the case has likely already been made, but hasn\u2019t been announced. The president, Napolitano said, is preparing the public for the fallout from a decision that goes against him.\n\n\u201cHe thinks he\u2019s going to lose, and he\u2019s trying to downplay the significance of that loss and disrespect the court,\u201d Napolitano said.\n\n\u201cGuess what, Mr. President, the Supreme Court and not the president has the final word on the meaning of the law and its consistency with the Constitution. That\u2019s been the law of the land for 230 years.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s true, of course. But it\u2019s worth remembering that it was the same Supreme Court \u2013 under the same Chief Justice John Roberts \u2013 that saved Obamacare in a June 2012 ruling. And it\u2019s worth remembering that Obama expressed a similar confidence two months before that ruling was announced.\n\nMaybe the president really can\u2019t intimidate the Supreme Court. But he\u2019s been in office for six year. He\u2019s appointed two lapdog liberals of his own to the bench. And truly reliable conservative votes are confined to Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and \u2014 usually \u2014 Samuel Alito.\n\nAt this date, maybe Obama doesn\u2019t have to.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "Accusing President Obama of trying to intimidate the Supreme Court, Judge Andrew Napolitano slammed the White House on Monday and predicted the president will lose a high court case that strikes at the heart of Obamacare\u2019s future.
