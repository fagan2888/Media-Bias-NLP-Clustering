It is worth asking what that means, and whether the United States can actually do it.\n\nThe administration says the Islamic State group is neither Islamic nor a state. One of the problems in fighting a non-state actor is determining what constitutes victory. Unlike conventional wars, there is no territory to seize, no capital to occupy, no formal signing ceremony on the decks of the USS Missouri. So how do you know when you\u2019ve won?\n\nThe latest National Strategy for Counterterrorism says that a terror group is defeated when its \u201cprimary individuals and groups [are] rendered powerless, and its message relegated to irrelevance.\u201d That is a succinct definition, but a difficult objective. Al-Qaida, the focus of the strategy, has been significantly reduced but not rendered powerless, and its ideology is alive and well. The Islamic State group is an al-Qaida offshoot with an identical message, tens of thousands of fighters, an increasing number of affiliates and operational control over territory spanning at least two countries. It can certainly be disrupted, degraded and to an extent dismantled. But \u201cdestroyed\u201d is another matter.\n\n[SEE: Editorial Cartoons on the Islamic State]\n\nThe administration has complicated its message by creating a muddle over whether the United States is in fact at war with the Islamic State. When the president of the United States makes a prime time address to the American people announcing that he is launching a long-term military effort to destroy a major threat to the country, it sounds a lot like war. But almost immediately after last week\u2019s speech, senior administration officials and spokespeople began insisting this was not a war. They insist it should be described as a \u201csustained counterterrorism operation.\u201d Various rationales were proffered for why war was an inappropriate term: that there was no formal declaration, that the war powers resolution was not invoked, or that it can\u2019t be war if there are no \u201cboots on the ground.\u201d\n\nWhat Secretary of State John Kerry has called the \"tortured debate over terminology\u201d is a mess of the administration\u2019s own making. The White House has no problem using the term \u201cwar\u201d when it comes to al-Qaida. The National Counterterrorism Strategy emphasizes that \u201cwe are at war with a specific organization \u2014 al-Qa\u2018ida.\u201d Elsewhere, it notes that al-Qaida is an umbrella term that encompasses the group\u2019s \u201caffiliates and adherents\u201d \u2014 a list which includes al-Qaida in Iraq, the Islamic State group in an earlier iteration. So, in truth, the United States has been at war with the Islamic State for years. Yet today, we seem to be bashful about saying precisely that.\n\n[MORE: Cartoons on Syria]\n\nThe Islamic State has no such hang-ups. It is waging a holy war, even if the White House doesn\u2019t recognize it as such, and is willing to die to prove its point. This underscores the asymmetry of fighting terrorist movements. The leaders of the Islamic State group are highly motivated, willing to \u201cpay any price, bear any burden\u201d in pursuit of their vision. Their only \u201ctortured debates\u201d are about how many people to torture. In order to defeat them, the United States has to approach the campaign with the same serious intent. This is not a bloodless, technical exercise in managing regional stability. If the United States is going to destroy the Islamic State, call it a war and get it done.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "World Report [Opinion]", "title": "Call the Fight With the Islamic State a War and Get It Done", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The administration has created a muddle over whether we are at war with the Islamic State group.", "title": "Call It a War and Win It", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/world-report/2014/09/16/call-the-fight-with-the-islamic-state-a-war-and-get-it-done", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/d7/ff52b78ac0bc0079e35bcbb99bdb42/media:4013cff6973e40d2a1cd88c88b483b3bMideastIslamicStateSyria.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Call the Fight With the Islamic State a War and Get It Done", "description": "The administration has created a muddle over whether we are at war with the Islamic State group.<br>", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Sept. 16, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "James S.
