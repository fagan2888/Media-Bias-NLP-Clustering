NBC does, I don\u2019t care for them.\u201d He vaguely acknowledged the Conan O\u2019Brien fracas that ensued by clarifying, \u201cTonight is our last show for real. I don\u2019t need to be fired three times. I get the hint.\u201d\n\nOn a more sentimental note, Leno said he was touched by all the outpouring of good wishes he\u2019s received, even \u201cAnthony Weiner sent me a photo of his penis looking sad.\u201d He reflected on his long career, but worried about his unemployment: \u201cI\u2019m no longer covered at NBC, I\u2019d have to sign up for Obamacare.\u201d\n\nOf course, it wouldn\u2019t be a Jay Leno monologue with the usual topical jokes, and Leno took some parting shots at Justin Bieber, the Sochi Olympics, and, of course, all the politicians Leno\u2019s had fun with over the past 22 years.\n\nWatch the video below, via NBC:\n\n[photo via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\nFollow Josh Feldman on Twitter: @feldmaniac", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tonight is Jay Leno\u2019s final night hosting long-running NBC institution The Tonight Show, and Leno pulled no punches in his opening monologue, taking multiple", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/leno.jpg", "title": "Leno Goes for Broke in Final Tonight Show Monologue: \u2018I Don\u2019t Like Good-Byes.
