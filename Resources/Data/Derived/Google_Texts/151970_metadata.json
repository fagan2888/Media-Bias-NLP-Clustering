Small potatoes. The folks at BMW are thinking big-time when it comes to the river.\n\nWhat if you could avoid L.A.\u2019s notorious traffic by traveling around the city in a mini, self-driving submarine?\n\nImagine \u2014 you could whoosh downtown in minutes in your own submarine-like pod.\n\nSLIDE SHOW: 10 reasons to salute L.A.'s transportation future\n\nIt is the brainchild of BMW Group DesignWorks USA. The conceptual plan was offered as part of the Los Angeles Auto Show\u2019s annual design challenge. This year\u2019s theme is \u201cBiomimicry and Mobility 2025: Nature's Answer to Human Challenges.\u201d BMW came up with the idea of using the river as an alternative to clogged freeways.\n\nAnd it makes perfect sense.\n\nThe river itself follows some of L.A.\u2019s most congested freeways \u2014 from the 101 in the San Fernando Valley to the 5 through downtown to the 710 to Long Beach. Then there are miles and miles of tributaries that snake through the region as narrow, concrete-lined channels.\n\nThe L.A. River has always been one of the region\u2019s most underappreciated assets. Turns out, we just need to stop thinking of it as a waterway and start making it a speedway.\n\nOf course, there are all kinds of real-world, practical problems with using the flood-control network as a high-speed rapid-transit system. Most of the year, the river is only a couple of feet deep, so you\u2019d have to pump lots of water into the system to operate a submarine. Where would we get that much water? Then there are plants, fish and other wildlife in the river that could be impacted by high-speed watercraft. And there\u2019s money and safety and stuff like that.\n\nBut don\u2019t let details deter this big idea. Submarines in the L.A. River: This is the future.\n\nALSO:\n\nKicking Obamacare\u2019s problems down the road\n\nWhen is a super typhoon more than just a super typhoon?\n\nKilled or injured cyclists had it coming?
