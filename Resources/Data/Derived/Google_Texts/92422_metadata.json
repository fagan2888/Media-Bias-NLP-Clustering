Let\u2019s just consider all the things he didn\u2019t mention: The Social Security Disability Insurance trust fund will be empty in a year, leading to about a 19 percent cut in benefits. Whatever your position is about the role of government in providing disability insurance, we can\u2019t ignore the issue for much longer. I suspect the president and Democrats would like Congress to change the law so the disability program can get some of the taxes that now go to the other Social Security trust fund; as my colleague Chuck Blahous (a Social Security trustee, as it happens) has explained, this won\u2019t fix the problem \u2014 which is why the debate over the issue needs to begin.\n\nWhatever Congress does with the disability fund, Social Security is also on an unsustainable path and will face its own large cuts sometime after 2030. There was also no mention either of the explosion of spending in Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 slowdown in health inflation or not \u2014 or any suggestions about how to address that problem.\n\nMandatory spending consumes the majority of our budget, and its share will continue to grow. It\u2019s not a recent phenomenon, as you can see on this chart:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rest of the budget \u2013 the money we spend on roads, education, the military, etc. \u2014 is still projected to grow in nominal terms in the future, but much more slowly than mandatory spending.\n\nThe president made it clear last night that his biggest priority for our future is to fight global warning, which ignores that simply running out of money is going to make it impossible, eventually, to pay attention to other priorities. The world has budget constraints.\n\nI did love his shout out to future generations and how much \u201cwe\u201d value them. Well, Mr. President, if you value our kids so much, now is the time to engage in fundamental reforms of Social Security, Medicare, Obamacare, and Medicaid.
