With optogenetics, neuroscience researchers can control brain cell activities through the use of light, which could eventually allow doctors to help understand, diagnose, and treat epilepsy and depression.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s a way for researchers to control the brain and behavior through light. Rather than being hypnotized, the mouse in the study had specific brain neurons controlled that impacted its actions. A group of researchers are also hoping to employ optogenetics to gain insight into alcohol addiction. In November, scientists at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center published a new study that used optogenetics to better understand the neuro-chemical aspects of addiction. The authors of the study, led by Evgeny A. Budygin, assistant professor of neurobiology and anatomy at Wake Forest, used the tool to highlight and obtain control over particular dopamine cell populations through light. This technique gave them information about the different patterns of dopamine cell activity that could have an effect on reducing alcohol addiction. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that controls the areas of reward and pleasure in the brain.\n\nWhile the brain controls the activity of brain cells, neuroscientists have struggled to find a way to control brain cells themselves \u2014 but with optogenetics, they can choose which neurons to turn on or off, whenever they want. By activating certain neurons, they can find out which ones govern specific behaviors. When it comes to alcohol addiction, researchers can thus find out the casual relationship between neuro-chemical changes in the brain and addictive behavior.\n\n\u201cThere was instant buzz about it,\u201d Elizabeth Hillman, a biomedical engineer at Columbia University, told NPR about optogenetics. \u201cPeople were sort of running around and saying, \u2018What is this thing, where can I get it, how can I do it?'\u201d Instead of using a wire probe inserted into the brain to poke and activate brain cells, with optogenetics, scientists could turn on individual cells with just light. \u201cYou can select that very specific genetic cell type, and you can tell that specific cell type to react when you shine light on it,\u201d Hillman said.\n\nJeffrey L. Weiner, co-author of the alcohol addiction study and professor of physiology and pharmacology at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, said in a news release that though they tested optogenetics in rats that had grown to have alcohol-drinking tendencies, there was \u201ctranslational value\u201d from the study, with potential to be used to treat humans.\n\nHowever, scientists still face massive obstacles before being able to employ optogenetics in humans. For one thing, before being able to control neurons through light, you must add genetic material to every brain cell you desire to control. This has been done in mice, but genetic engineering in human brain neurons is not yet an option, Hillman told NPR. Another problem is getting light to pierce deep into the brain to reach cells: \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to get light to go deep,\u201d Hillman said, \u201cand we all know this just from trying to shine a flashlight through our hand.\u201d There\u2019s also the concern that too many cells may be reached with the light, on the other hand, which could cause unwanted problems as well.\n\nScientists still retain hope however, to be able to stop seizures with the flash of a light. Once the method is tweaked, there may also be uses for optogenetics to fight Parkinson\u2019s disease, depression, addiction, and schizophrenia. \u201cNow we are taking the first steps in this direction,\u201d Budygin said in a news release. \u201cIt was impossible before the optogenetic era.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "optogenetics, alcohol addiction, brain, neuroscience", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Scientists have found a way to control the brain through light, and now the tool may assist in treating addiction.", "title": "How \u2018Optogenetics\u2019 Could Cure Alcohol Addiction With Light", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/using-light-control-brain-how-optogenetics-could-cure-alcohol-addiction-265899", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/27/brain-neurons.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Scientists have found a way to control the brain through light, and now the tool may assist in treating addiction.", "title": "How \u2018Optogenetics\u2019 Could Cure Alcohol Addiction With Light", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/using-light-control-brain-how-optogenetics-could-cure-alcohol-addiction-265899", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/27/brain-neurons.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/27/brain-neurons.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-12-27T16:44:18-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-27T16:44:17-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Scientists have found a way to control the brain through light, and now the tool may assist in treating addiction."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde068\"", "article_summary": "A group of researchers are also hoping to employ optogenetics to gain insight into alcohol addiction.\nIn November, scientists at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center published a new study that used optogenetics to better understand the neuro-chemical aspects of addiction.\nOnce the method is tweaked, there may also be uses for optogenetics to fight Parkinson\u2019s disease, depression, addiction, and schizophrenia.\nThis has been done in mice, but genetic engineering in human brain neurons is not yet an option, Hillman told NPR.\nRather than being hypnotized, the mouse in the study had specific brain neurons controlled that impacted its actions."}
