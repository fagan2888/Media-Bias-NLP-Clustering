Only nineteen per cent of Americans trust \u201cthe government\u201d to do what\u2019s right, down from thirty-two per cent in Bush, Sr.,\u2019s second term (and seventy-three per cent in 1960). Fifty per cent distrust President Obama. Approval ratings for Congress are in single digits. And so on.\n\nNow, about AMERICA\u2019S CRISIS OF TRUST \u2014what does that remind you of?\n\nNothing, probably, if you\u2019re under fifty. But if you remember leisure suits, est training, and Abscam, you may recall President Jimmy Carter\u2019s 1979 address to the nation on what he called the \u201ccrisis of confidence,\u201d better known as the \u201cmalaise speech.\u201d\n\nThe malaise speech\u2014which I helped write, and about which, in 2009, the thirtieth anniversary of its delivery, I blogged ad infinitum, not to say ad nauseum\u2014was at once a moral zenith and a political nadir of the Carter Presidency. Carter himself was its impresario and auteur, but its intellectual father was Pat Caddell, then twenty-nine years old. The speech had its origins in a gigantic doorstopper of an eyes-only, book-length memo, written by Caddell and his then-sidekick Wayne Granquist, and it got its indelible tag from background briefings Caddell gave to the press. (The word \u201cmalaise\u201d appears nowhere in the speech. It\u2019s a French word, and Carter always crossed those out.)\n\nFrom the speech:\n\nThe symptoms of this crisis of the American spirit are all around us. For the first time in the history of our country a majority of our people believe that the next five years will be worse than the past five years. Two-thirds of our people do not even vote As you know, there is a growing disrespect for government and for churches and for schools, the news media, and other institutions. This is not a message of happiness or reassurance, but it is the truth and it is a warning. These changes did not happen overnight. They\u2019ve come upon us gradually over the last generation, years that were filled with shocks and tragedy.\n\nCompare and contrast. Or just compare, because there isn\u2019t all that much in the way of contrast.\n\nThe diagnosis is essentially the same, whether you call the malady a crisis of confidence (1979) or a crisis of trust (2013). True, the doctor has moved uptown. In his youth, Caddell was a liberal Democrat: pre-Carter, he was George McGovern\u2019s pollster; post-Carter, he was Gary Hart\u2019s. All that was a long time ago. Now he\u2019s a Fox News Democrat, which is to say a Democrat in name only. (Schoen has made a similar, though less emphatic, journey.) Caddell and Schoen have a weekend show on the network of Hannity and Doocy. They have the odd tut-tut for Republicans, but their real ire\u2014Caddell\u2019s especially\u2014is reserved for their allegedly fellow Dems. They occasionally gum the hand that feeds them, but their attacks on their own are red in tooth and claw.\n\nHere, for example, are Caddell and Schoen last March, referring to the Democrat in the White House:\n\nHis self-righteous rhetoric obscures a bitter truth: Obama is not trying to unite the country. He\u2019s waging a class-based battle for political gain.\n\nLast month, the Democrats in the Senate decided that executive and lower-court judicial appointments will henceforth be confirmed or rejected by a simple majority vote. Caddell, writing by himself this time, called this long-overdue restoration of the Framers\u2019 original intention a \u201ccrime against a government of rules,\u201d an \u201cinstitutional act of coup de etat [sic],\u201d and \u201ca stunning capstone to what has been already a steady erosion of a government of laws down to a sort of semi-political banana republic.\u201d\n\n(I have to say that my old comrade has a point about the United States becoming a semi-political banana republic. But the semi-shackling of the filibuster was a step away from chaos, paralysis, and the empowerment of reactionary juntas, not a step toward it.)\n\nOne more example. In a column boosting a Fox News \u201cdocumentary\u201d about the food-stamp program, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP , Caddell mysteriously says that what he rather callously calls \u201cAmerica\u2019s great food stamp binge\u201d is \u201ca direct result of the Obama administration\u2019s surreptitious undermining of the law in the Stimulus Act in 2009 and the disingenuous gutting of President Clinton\u2019s overwhelmingly successful Welfare Reform law.\u201d (Soberer analysts recognize that what the spike in food-stamp eligibility is a direct result of is hard times: the financial crisis, the Great Recession, and the consequent growth of poverty and joblessness.)\n\nCaddell writes that as he watched the Fox doc, \u201cI began to see what was behind the SNAP program.\u201d Feeding the hungry? No. \u201cIt is about changing the mentality of the nation, of Americans.\u201d Its \u201cutterly foul\u201d purpose, under Obama, is to get people dependent on government \u201chandouts\u201d and to destroy \u201cthe tradition of tightening your belt and taking care of yourself when times get tough\u201d:\n\nMany of you have probably heard the Chinese proverb, \u201cGive a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.\u201d The SNAP program is one big fish giveaway that leaves people reliant rather than reliable.\n\nThis sort of thing is of course deplorable, but there\u2019s much less of it in the Schoen-Caddell piece quoted at the top of this post, and it doesn\u2019t affect the validity of their main point. There was a crisis of public confidence in 1979, there is a crisis of public trust in 2013, and the similarities are striking.\n\nThe solution Schoen and Caddell offer is that hoary fantasy, a \u201ccentrist\u201d third party. This is a fantasy for two reasons. In a winner-take-all electoral system like ours, the only concrete effect of any third party is to take votes away from whichever of the two main parties it is ideologically closest to. And third parties never actually achieve power. The only new party that ever did so was the Republican Party, in 1860. But that was a consequence of the total breakdown in national unity over the issue of slavery. The Whigs imploded, the Democrats splintered, and Lincoln won a four-candidate race with less than forty per cent of the vote.\n\nI suppose one can imagine circumstances in which a sufficiently charismatic \u201ccentrist\u201d third-partier could hope to win a Presidential election. Theodore Roosevelt and Ross Perot indulged that hope, and Colin Powell flirted with it. At the congressional level, though, any such upheaval is impossible as long as the present system of single-member districts prevails.\n\n\u201cFor the first time,\u201d Schoen and Caddell note,\n\nvoters want to defeat all members of Congress. Rasmussen figures show that close to 80 percent of Americans say that they\u2019d throw out the entire Congress and start over.\n\nWouldn\u2019t that be nice? Unfortunately, we don\u2019t get to vote for (or against) \u201call members of Congress.\u201d We each get to vote on two per cent of the Senate\u2014and two-tenths of one per cent of the House. No matter what \u201cclose to 80 per cent of Americans\u201d say, we already know to a moral certainty that there will be no change next year in a minimum of three hundred and seventy-four of our four hundred and thirty-five congressional districts.\n\nHappy holidays, everybody. And to our friends at Fox News, Merry Christmas.\n\nPhotograph by Melina Mara/The Washington Post/Getty.", "article_metadata": {"cache-version": 20160526204643, "description": "In Politico Magazine, a piece by Douglas Schoen and Patrick Caddell sounds like a ghostly echo from the Carter Presidency.", "account-url": "https://account.newyorker.com", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "og": {"site_name": "The New Yorker", "description": "In Politico Magazine, a piece by Douglas Schoen and Patrick Caddell sounds like a ghostly echo from the Carter Presidency.", "title": "Malaise II: Revenge of the DINOs - The New Yorker", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 580, "identifier": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/185027084-580.jpg", "height": 396}, "updated_time": "2014-07-16T17:46:51-04:00", "url": "http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/malaise-ii-revenge-of-the-dinos", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In Politico Magazine, a piece by Douglas Schoen and Patrick Caddell sounds like a ghostly echo from the Carter Presidency.", "creator": "@RickHertzberg", "image": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/185027084-580.jpg", "title": "Malaise II: Revenge of the DINOs - The New Yorker", "site": "@newyorker", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The New Yorker", "robots": "noodp", "parsely-metadata": "{\"id\":\"1765201\",\"title_alt\":\"Malaise II: Revenge of the DINOs\",\"featured_image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.newyorker.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2013\\/12\\/185027084-580-580-375.jpg\"}", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "environment": "prod", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1081530898", "fb": {"admins": 757909316}, "article": {"section": "Hendrik Hertzberg", "tag": "Politics", "published_time": "2013-12-13T17:27:52-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-16T17:46:51-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "_jvLA9pRQom0-f6587wRKrNwfRtqyKzjfYWvwcZ5fxc", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "id": 1765201, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "Politics"}, "article_summary": "The diagnosis is essentially the same, whether you call the malady a crisis of confidence (1979) or a crisis of trust (2013).\nNow, about AMERICA\u2019S CRISIS OF TRUST \u2014what does that remind you of?\nThere was a crisis of public confidence in 1979, there is a crisis of public trust in 2013, and the similarities are striking.\nThe Whigs imploded, the Democrats splintered, and Lincoln won a four-candidate race with less than forty per cent of the vote.\nRasmussen figures show that close to 80 percent of Americans say that they\u2019d throw out the entire Congress and start over."}
