Everything from the visual voicemail feature to the scrolling technology has a patent.\n\nYour dog\u2019s favorite Kong (based in Golden) chew toy? There\u2019s a patent for that. Smart Wool socks, based in Steamboat Springs? There\u2019s a patent for that, too. Even Louis Pasteur filed a patent in 1873 for \u201can improvement in brewing beer and ale\u201d that helped keep air out of the fermentation process, something the thousands of home-brewers and hundreds of brewpubs in Colorado can appreciate.\n\nWe enjoy the world\u2019s strongest intellectual property system, thanks to the foresight and vision of our founding fathers, who more than 200 years ago enshrined in our constitution a principle that created an ideal balance between the ownership and sharing of new ideas and discoveries.\n\nSince then, the USPTO has granted millions of patents, adding \u201cfuel of interest to the fire of genius,\u201d as Abraham Lincoln described our patent system in a speech on invention in 1858. Lincoln, the only president to ever hold a patent, counted the creation of patent laws as one of the top three most significant events in history, next to the discovery of America and the invention of printing.\n\nOn Monday, we will celebrate another milestone in the history and development of the U.S. patent system when we cut the ribbon on a new satellite patent office in Denver. The office will be the second of only four regional patent offices planned nationwide.\n\nColorado\u2019s selection is a testament to our state\u2019s reputation as a hotbed for innovation, creativity and entrepreneurialism. It\u2019s a recognition of our state\u2019s pioneering and exploring roots, from the 19th century gold miners who chartered their own course through the Rocky Mountain West, to the modern-day entrepreneurs who are blazing new trails through fields like bioscience, clean energy, high-tech, and advanced manufacturing. Our state has always been led by visionaries and risk-takers who dared to dream big. And this satellite patent office joins things like crowdfunding and the Blackstone Entrepreneurs Network as yet another tool in their toolbox as they continue to innovate and drive our economy.\n\nIn fact, the idea of having multiple regional offices came from Colorado, the culmination of nearly a decade of work by the intellectual property legal community, local municipal and business leaders across the state, multiple governors, and Colorado\u2019s congressional delegation. In the Senate, Mark Udall and I wrote a provision in the 2011 America Invents Act to establish three satellite patent offices by 2014.\n\nThat provision alone did not guarantee that Colorado would be selected as a satellite patent office location. We worked with a core group of economic development and business leaders around the state, including the Metro Denver EDC, Accelerate Colorado, and the Colorado Bioscience Association, along with our congressional delegation and municipal leaders to make a winning case for why Colorado was a perfect fit to host a satellite office.\n\nOn Monday, we\u2019ll celebrate the best of Colorado: Democrats and Republicans, urban and rural leaders, entrepreneurs and executives across all sectors, all working together to put differences aside and do what\u2019s best for our state. And we\u2019ll begin Denver\u2019s chapter in the centuries-old story of the world\u2019s greatest intellectual property system.\n\nU.S. Sen. Michael F.
