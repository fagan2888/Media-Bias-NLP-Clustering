(KTUL) - An on-going battle between the Obama administration and religious non-profits is one step closer to reaching a resolution. The fight is over birth control coverage.\n\nOn Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court made a decision to take a step away from the dispute and let lower courts find a compromise.\n\nRELATED: SCOTUS avoids major ruling in birth control dispute\n\nContraceptive coverage has been a requirement in the Affordable Care Act since its early stages. However, religious non-profits across the country say it's unfair the government is forcing the concept of birth control despite religious beliefs.\n\n\n\n\"The schools would have been stuck with a choice whether to follow their religion and pay enormous fines or compromise their faith and participate in acts that they believe are contributing to evil,\" said Greg Baylor, an attorney for the Alliance Defending Freedom.\n\nThe ADF has been representing four Christian universities in Oklahoma since 2012 when a lawsuit was filed. They joined several organizations in the nation challenging the mandate.\n\nBaylor said the SCOTUS decision is not exactly what he was expecting, but it's a step in the right direction toward protecting religious freedom.\n\n\"The court seems to agree that there is another way that this can be done, a way that does not involve the schools, does not involve them violating their religious convictions,\" said Baylor.\n\n\n\nFor now, the high court's decision means the government birth control can be provided by the religious groups, but they cannot be fined if they refuse to follow the coverage rules.\n\nIt's now up to lower courts to decide how the mandate will be enforced from here.\n\n\"I'm certainly delighted by the prospect of reaching a resolution that doesn't violate the religious freedom of these schools. That's what we've been after all along,\" said Baylor.\n\nThe dispute is not likely to go back to SCOTUS for discussion before the 2016 presidential election.", "article_metadata": {"description": "TULSA, Okla.
