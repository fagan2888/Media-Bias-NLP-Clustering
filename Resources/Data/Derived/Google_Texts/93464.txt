The Arizona House has given initial approval to two bills blocking state funding for federal policies.

House Bill 2368 would block state funding for executive orders and policy directives from the U.S. Department of Justice.

Republican Rep. Bob Thorpe of Flagstaff says he designed the bill to push back against federal overreach using a state constitutional amendment voters approved in November known as Proposition 122.

House Bill 2643 by Rep. Justin Olson of Mesa would stop state and local governments from using financial resources to enforce and implement the Affordable Care Act. The bill would not affect the more than 200,000 Arizonans enrolled in the program.

Olson says the bill prevents future legislation that would establish a state exchange.

The bills received initial approval Monday and await a formal vote.
