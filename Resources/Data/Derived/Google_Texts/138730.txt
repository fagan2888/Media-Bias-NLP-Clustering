Denver firefighters quickly put out a fire at a residential home on Saturday afternoon, officials said.

The structure fire, which was out by 3:05 p.m., happened at 3600 North Ivanhoe Street, said a Denver Fire spokesman.

Fred Edmonds and his 12-year-old son noticed their neighbors needed help escaping the fire, Denver7 reported. The son called 911 while his father ran inside to rescue an elderly woman and another person.

Both were transported to a local hospital to be treated for smoke inhalation.

No firefighters were injured while putting out the blaze.

Firefighters said it was too early to determine the cause of the fire.
