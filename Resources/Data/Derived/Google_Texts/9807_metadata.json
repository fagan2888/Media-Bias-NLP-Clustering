Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) going upriver to \u201cterminate, with extreme prejudice\u201d the maddened Col. Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) in the Vietnam War.\n\nMr. Glenn was hired to work for just a few days of work but wound up staying on \u2014 and saving \u2014 the production for several months.\n\nMr. Glenn went to the Philippines \u2014 dubbing as war-torn Vietnam \u2014 two weeks before shooting his scenes at the request of Mr. Coppola to get used to the terrain, the time difference and the punishing humidity.\n\nMr. Glenn was first housed at a place called the Sand Valley Inn, which was a Japanese command bunker during World War II.\n\n\u201cWhen I got there almost all of the cast and crew and Francis were so sick of being there, that that weekend they decided to go back to Manila by helicopter,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd I thought, \u2018Nah, I\u2019m going to stick around.\u2019\u201d\n\nLeft on location with Mr. Glenn was a skeleton crew of movie craftsmen, production assistants, Martin Sheen \u2014 who was cast as the leading man after Mr. Coppola fired Harvey Keitel \u2014 and Mr. Sheen\u2019s family.\n\nNo sooner had the choppers whisked away Mr. Coppola and his entourage than the Pacific turned its wrath on the set: Two typhoons joined in the South China Sea and whirled back toward the Philippines as Typhoon Olga (Didang). The storm quickly tore the set to shreds.\n\n\u201cWhere we were had been an isthmus, and it turned into an island,\u201d Mr. Glenn said. \u201cAnd the only people who had any idea of how to behave in an emergency were me and another guy who was a production assistant named Doug Claybourne. We both were, still are and will be, past our deaths, United States Marines.\u201d\n\nMr. Glenn and Mr. Claybourne quickly took charge, setting up a toilet and salvaging what they could from the storm. Adding to their troubles was that a local woman was due to give birth to twins.\n\n\u201c[They asked if] anybody had ever delivered a kid,\u201d Mr. Glenn said with a chuckle, \u201cand begrudgingly I said, \u2018Yeah, I delivered my second daughter in our home in Topanga Canyon.\u2019\u201d\n\nEven under the best of circumstances, assisting in childbirth requires some light, but by then it was night and there was no fuel to spark up the lone generator. Mr. Glenn quickly whipped up a coconut moonshine to light the makeshift delivery room for a few hours on generator power.\n\n\u201cIt was the biggest typhoon that had hit the Philippines since 1932,\u201d Mr. Glenn said of Didang, which knocked out their ability to communicate with anyone in the capital city for three days. \u201cFrancis and everybody else in Manila probably thought we were dead for sure,\u201d Mr. Glenn said, \u201cbut they realized that we hadn\u2019t been destroyed, and as the waters started to recede, they came back.\u201d\n\nBut just as the waters retreated, the insurance underwriters of the film came calling, intent on determining whether the shoot could continue or was \u2014 quite literally \u2014 a wash.\n\n\u201cThe term \u2018force majeure\u2019 means that an insurance adjustor has to see that you\u2019re trying to continue shooting your film, and he has to see that it\u2019s impossible before they\u2019ll write out the check,\u201d Mr. Glenn said of the visit by the nervous underwriters. \u201cThey brought an insurance guy out to what had been like a kind of a mild little stream; it was [now] almost a whitewater.\u201d\n\nIn a desperate attempt to prove that the straits were anything but dire, Mr. Coppola and director of photography Vittorio Storaro tried to show the adjustors that the \u201cstream\u201d was in fact fordable. The duo boarded a production boat and set out to cross the angry rivulet.\n\n\u201cAnd of course what happened was, they got in the boat, they shoved the boat out into the stream, and the boat was just instantly caught by the current,\u201d Mr. Glenn said. \u201cBut they put a rope on the back on the boat so that if they couldn\u2019t get across, they could pull everybody back to shore.\u201d\n\nMr. Glenn quickly surmised that though tethered to land, when the safety rope went taut, the current would surely capsize the vessel, dumping both director and cinematographer into the drink.\n\n\u201cI sprinted the 25 yards and I pulled [a knife] out and cut the rope,\u201d he said. \u201cIt snapped like a big bullwhip and the boat was OK \u2014 it righted itself and went downstream\u201d so that its occupants could then be rescued.\n\nThe challenges were far from over. With the rain still coming down, one of the evacuation helicopter pilots refused to take off, saying the sideways deluge would mix with the fuel, which the pilot said would make the chopper \u201ccrap out on our way to Manila.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018No, I\u2019ll fill it up; I\u2019ve done it a million times before,\u201d Mr. Glenn said. \u201cAll you have to do is sort of shield the jet fuel pipe from the wind and shoot [the fuel] into the helicopter, and you can see there\u2019s no water getting into the tank.\u201d\n\nDespite his improvisational rescue, some jet fuel splashed onto his bare chest.\n\n\u201cOnce I filled the helicopter up, the front of my body looked like I had measles or something,\u201d he said, \u201cbut, you know, it goes away in a few hours. It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d\n\nMr. Coppola was so grateful for saving his life and allowing them to take off during the tempest that he offered Mr. Glenn his choice of any role in the film, even writing him one from scratch, he said.\n\nThinking quickly, Mr. Glenn responded, \u201cI want to be in the part with Marlon Brando at the end of the film.\u201d\n\nMr. Coppola\u2019s gratitude briskly turned to obstruction.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018That\u2019s the only part of the film I really can\u2019t write you a part for,\u2019\u201d Mr. Glenn said. \u201cHe said, \u2018It\u2019s completely settled; we\u2019ve got Dennis Hopper coming in\u201d for the role of the photojournalist who had fallen under the spell of Brando\u2019s character, the demented Col. Kurtz.\n\nPerhaps fearing his good deeds would not go unpunished, Mr. Glenn continued to press until Mr. Coppola came up with a viable solution.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018You could be [Lt. Richard M. Colby,] the guy who went up the river ahead of Martin Sheen,\u2019\u201d to assassinate Col. Kurtz but who also was bewitched by the mercurial soldier. \u201cBut he said, \u2018Scott, you\u2019ll be like a glorified extra,\u2019\u201d Mr. Glenn said, \u201c\u2018but if that\u2019s what you want, I\u2019ll do it.\u2019 And I said, \u2018That\u2019s what I want.\u2019\u201d\n\nEven though Colby turned out to be a wordless role \u2014 Mr. Sheen as Willard recognizes him upon arriving at the Kurtz compound, but upon stepping in close realizes that Colby\u2019s humanity has evaporated as he absently strokes his rifle with a vacant stare \u2014 Mr. Glenn knew it was his chance to apprentice at the throne of the legendary Brando.\n\n\u201cI knew that acting is like anything \u2014 you learn from doing it,\u201d Mr. Glenn said. \u201cAnd I thought, \u2018I want to be around Marlon Brando when he\u2019s doing stuff. I want to see Marlon Brando and Dennis Hopper, these, iconic brilliant people that I\u2019ve heard about my whole life. I can actually be there and talk to them and watch them.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Glenn\u2019s two-week job on \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d turned into a several-month assignment thanks to his coming into the Kurtz compound for the film\u2019s third act and to Mr. Coppola\u2019s giving him the job of assisting two former Green Berets in teaching the extras how to pass for real military as well as interacting with the indigenous Ifugao tribesmen who had been drafted as the tribe that Kurtz lords over like a god figure.\n\n\u201cI fell in love with the Ifugou,\u201d Mr. Glenn said, \u201cand I moved into their longhouses and learned their language and lived with them for months before Francis got there to shoot the end of the movie.\u201d\n\nDespite going wildly overbudget, Mr. Keitel\u2019s firing, Mr. Sheen\u2019s heart attack, Mr. Coppola\u2019s extramarital affair and the studio\u2019s constant threats to shut them down, \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d became one of the most venerated films in history, snagging two Oscars and earning nearly $80 million. It consistently ranks high on subjective lists of the greatest movies of all time.\n\nDespite his silent debut, Mr. Glenn went on to an acting career in nearly 100 films, including \u201cSilence of the Lambs\u201d and \u201cThe Barber,\u201d now out on DVD and video on demand.\n\nMr. Glenn remains thankful that his calm in the face of disaster not only saved the day and earned him a crucial-though-small role opposite Mr. Sheen but also extended his \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d paycheck.\n\n\u201cMy 2-week job turned into [a] 7-month job,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The challenges that bedeviled the production of Francis Ford Coppola's \"Apocalypse Now\" are legendary, but what isn't widely known is how an up-and-coming actor in a minor role salvaged the film set and crew from a typhoon and, arguably, saved its director's life.", "Author": "Eric Althoff", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The challenges that bedeviled the production of Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d are legendary, but what isn\u2019t widely known is how an up-and-coming actor in a minor role salvaged the film set and crew from a typhoon and, arguably, saved its director\u2019s life.", "title": "Scott Glenn used Marine training to help save \u2018Apocalypse Now\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/26/scott-glenn-used-marine-training-to-help-save-apoc/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/26/4_262015_scott-glenn-28201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/26/4_262015_scott-glenn-28201.jpg", "title": "Scott Glenn used Marine training to help save \u2018Apocalypse Now", "description": "The challenges that bedeviled the production of Francis Ford Coppola's \"Apocalypse Now\" are legendary, but what isn't widely known is how an up-and-coming actor in a minor role salvaged the film set a", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Scott Glenn, Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Sheen, Walter E Kurtz, Marlon Brando"}, "article_summary": "Perhaps fearing his good deeds would not go unpunished, Mr. Glenn continued to press until Mr. Coppola came up with a viable solution.\nMr. Glenn was first housed at a place called the Sand Valley Inn, which was a Japanese command bunker during World War II.\nMr. Glenn quickly whipped up a coconut moonshine to light the makeshift delivery room for a few hours on generator power.\nMr. Glenn was hired to work for just a few days of work but wound up staying on \u2014 and saving \u2014 the production for several months.\nMr. Glenn went to the Philippines \u2014 dubbing as war-torn Vietnam \u2014 two weeks before shooting his scenes at the request of Mr. Coppola to get used to the terrain, the time difference and the punishing humidity."}
