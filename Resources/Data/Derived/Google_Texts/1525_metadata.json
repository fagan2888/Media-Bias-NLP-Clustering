It\u2019s really about rainbows and having fun and getting dressed up.\u201d\n\nDavid Haack has been coming to pride events in Seattle for 24 years and has seen a lot of changes in Washington and at the event.\n\n\u201cPride used to be more of a march, and we still have a political activism stance to a certain degree. But it\u2019s about family now,\u201d Haack said.\n\n\u201cWhoever thought it was going to be like this?\u201d asked Hugh Charest, who attended his first Seattle Pride event in 1986.\n\nHe knows many of the young people won\u2019t ever fully grasp what it took to get where they are today.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t expect any of them to. I don\u2019t expect them to understand what it was like. Unless you lived through it, you can\u2019t understand it,\u201d Charest said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: KING-TV, http://www.king5.com/", "article_metadata": {"description": "Seattle's gay pride celebration has evolved from a political parade to a family event featuring bounce houses, free ice cream and marching Boy Scouts and cheerleaders.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Seattle\u2019s gay pride celebration has evolved from a political parade to a family event featuring bounce houses, free ice cream and marching Boy Scouts and cheerleaders.", "title": "Seattle gay pride event is about families, participants say", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/28/seattle-gay-pride-event-is-about-families/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/28/d5dafc8cd2eeb41c7a0f6a706700469c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/28/d5dafc8cd2eeb41c7a0f6a706700469c.jpg", "title": "Seattle gay pride event is about families, participants say", "description": "Seattle's gay pride celebration has evolved from a political parade to a family event featuring bounce houses, free ice cream and marching Boy Scouts and cheerleaders.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhoever thought it was going to be like this?\u201d asked Hugh Charest, who attended his first Seattle Pride event in 1986.\nSEATTLE (AP) - Seattle\u2019s gay pride celebration has evolved from a political parade to a family event featuring bounce houses, free ice cream and marching Boy Scouts and cheerleaders.\n\u201c(She\u2019s) way too young to understand,\u201d Kroll told KING-TV (http://is.gd/FCP6kP ).\nKevin Kroll, who brought his 4-year-old to enjoy the festivities, says the event is just about fun and games for her.\n\u201cPride used to be more of a march, and we still have a political activism stance to a certain degree."}
