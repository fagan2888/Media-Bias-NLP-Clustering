Valve demos Steam Controller, confirms awfulness of playing shooters with touchpads Probably the single most-argued argument in all of gaming is the silly, ill-formed rivalry between the console gamepad and the PC mouse and keyboard.

Why Microsoft Word must die I hate Microsoft Word. I want Microsoft Word to die. I hate Microsoft Word with a burning, fiery passion. I hate Microsoft Word the way Winston Smith hated Big Brother. Our reasons are, alarmingly, not dissimilar. Microsoft Word is a tyrant of the imagination, a petty, unimaginative, inconsistent dictator that is ill-suited to any creative writer's use. Worse: it is a near-monopolist, dominating the word processing field. Charlie Stross

A hundred bucks says you won't read this story Our new hundred-dollar bill, like every other single piece of American folding money, is born in this rotary boiler. It's a perfect sphere, an angry kettle fifteen feet across, spinning high off the ground between two stained concrete towers. Most people swear out loud when they see it for the first time. A network of gears, each tooth the size of a fist, churns away in the darkness behind it. Esquire

Are Valve and AMD about to ruin PC gaming? When the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were announced earlier this year, I saw it as a victory for the PC. Soon, it seemed, bringing major blockbusters to the PC would be easier than ever. There would be three major gaming platforms -- the PlayStation 4, the Xbox One, and the Windows PC -- and each one would be only a slight twist on the same basic formula. The Tech Report
