My Conservative Adventure.

Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry

(ThyBlackMan.com) Like millions of Americans I was deeply saddened and frustrated that Terry McAuliffe, a dishonorable man propped up by dishonorable people won over Conservative Republican Ken Cuccinelli in the tightly contested race for governor of Virginia.

Talk about birds of a feather, the man who told the biggest lie ever told by a U.S. president to the American people, (if you like your plan and doctor, you can keep them) stumps for McAuliffe.

Then, there are the Democrats, Republicans and mainstream media figuratively placing a “Wanted Politically Dead or Alive” bounty on Ted Cruz for leading the movement to defund the monstrous Obamacare. Yes, I have been in the thick of it for most of this year.

Taking a brief break from my travels trying to get conservatives elected, I flew to Baltimore to visit my 85 year old dad.

A young black man drove the shuttle bus from the airport to the car rental location. Wow, he was awesome. He took his job seriously. Like a general he politely delivered orders which insured everyone’s safety and comfort. He said, “Ladies and gentleman, please bear with me. My job is to get you to your destination safely.” Feeling his commitment, the crowded passengers gave him a hearty round of applause. A lesser person would think, I am only a shuttle bus driver. To this young eagle, his job was obviously his ministry. I tipped him well.

My time with dad was wonderful. He is the pastor of four churches. As he passionately shared a highlight from the sermon he preached that Sunday, I thought, “Thank you God. At 85, dad still has it.” I felt extremely blessed.

A lifelong Democrat, Dad challenged me about the wisdom of “my” Republicans shutting down the government. I told Dad all the facts that he will never hear on his beloved CNN; Obama inflicting unnecessary pain on the American people during the shutdown to make Republicans look bad. http://bit.ly/1byUEV7 To make Republicans look bad, Harry Reid rejected the idea to fund children’s cancer research through the government shutdown. http://dailym.ai/18QelUn

As for the Democrats bogus claim that the poor will suffer and die if we do not continuously raise the debt ceiling, I informed Dad the government wastes 42 billion dollars a year. http://bit.ly/Yn46CJ

Dad mentioned how God is being banned from the public square. http://bit.ly/iXn2OI He feels political pressure to embrace same sex marriage. He said, “They have come out of the closet and we are being forced into the closet.”

I explained how Obama is fundamentally transforming America into liberal’s socialist/progressive dream. His agenda which includes same sex marriage, late term abortion, amnesty for illegals, gun control, addicting as many Americans as possible to government assistance and redistribution of wealth is strongly supported by the Democratic Party, Hollywood and the mainstream media.

All who dare oppose the Administration’s agenda are branded haters and publicly humiliated by pundits and the mainstream media. Obama uses government agencies such as the IRS to punish those he perceives to be his enemies. http://bit.ly/180kpbc

This lead to dad and I discussing the claim that the Tea Party is racist. I told dad that it was all a despicable infuriating lie. I shared about the terminally ill white woman I met at a Tea Party whose daughter told a staffer that her mom said all she wanted to do was to meet Lloyd Marcus before she died. Dad was stunned.

I shared about the white cowboy and his wife with their two adopted black babies at a Tea Party.

I told dad that I called NAACP, president Ben Jealous a despicable liar during a TV interview for claiming to have seen signs which read, “Lynch Barack Obama” and “Lynch Eric Holder”. If such signs existed, the media would have exploited the images to the max to further their evil irresponsible narrative that the tea party is racist. To date, no one on the planet has seen the two signs other than Ben Jealous.

Obama has been lying, pulling the wool over American’s eyes for five years. Dad said something that gave me hope. He said, “The truth always raises.” Obama’s approval and trust poll numbers are plummeting. http://bit.ly/1aDdEuA

Back home in Florida, our house sitter was scheduled to pick me up from the airport in my car. My car broke down at the airport. The tow truck driver was a young Hispanic man married with two very young children. He was a low info voter with an attitude reflective of Obama’s view of America.

He expressed bitterness against the rich and even said his skin-color was keeping him from succeeding.

My insurance covered the cost of the tow. Still, I gave him a generous tip which opened the door for me to bless this misguided young man with a brief lecture. “Look, forget that skin-color crap. Just pursue your dreams.” He nodded and said, yes, he would.

All my car needed was a new battery. The opportunity to positively impact the life of that young father (tow truck driver) was worth the inconvenience; a rewarding end to my conservative adventure, visiting Dad in Maryland and home to Florida.
