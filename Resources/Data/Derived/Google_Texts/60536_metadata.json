The \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d is anything but affordable.\n\nWhen Barack Obama tells people they should give up their cable and cellphone to pay for Obamacare, someone needs to point out where the \u201caffordable\u201d part of Obamacare is.\n\nWhile the majority of Americans want Obamacare repealed, Republicans in Congress lack the leadership to do anything about it. The House leadership is not making a real effort to repeal Obamacare. They just schedule a series of meaningless votes.\n\nInstead of showing leadership, Republican leaders in the House stumble around like newly castrated cattle, trying to figure out what they lost and why it was important.\n\nThere is a strategy that will work to repeal Obamacare, if the Republican leadership will act on it.\n\nAll the House leadership has to do is attach a sunset provision for Obamacare to a piece of must-pass legislation.\n\nSunset provisions are something that should be attached to every major law passed by Congress. Ronald Reagan once said: \u201cThe nearest thing to eternal life we will ever see on this earth is a government program.\u201d Government programs, no matter how good or how bad, are never repealed.\n\nObamacare, to quote former Sen. Max Baucus, Montana Democrat, is a \u201ctrain wreck.\u201d Yet Democrats will not vote to repeal it.\n\nThe sunset provision that should be attached to a must-pass bill would say simply, \u201cUnless reauthorized by Congress, the Affordable Care Act shall be repealed on November 1, 2016.\u201d\n\nThat date is no accident. That date is right before the 2016 presidential election. The 2016 election should be a referendum on Obamacare. If Obamacare is such a great idea, Democrats need to step up and do more than just give it lip service. They should face the voters on it.\n\nEndangered Democratic lawmakers this year are distancing themselves from Obamacare and from President Obama. They are hoping they can squeak through a re-election, then two or six years from now, Obamacare will no longer be an issue as America simply accepts its suffering.\n\nIf Obamacare is popular, the Democrats should put their money where their mouths are. They should support a sunset provision for Obamacare, then run in 2016 on reauthorizing Obamacare.\n\nFor conservatives, there is a lesson here as well.\n\nConservatives cannot simply sit back and allow law after law to be passed. Conservatives should make a pledge that when conservatives do control the Congress, every law that is passed will have a five-year sunset provision.\n\nIf a law or a program is a tremendous success, Congress will have no trouble reauthorizing it. However, if the program is a miserable failure, like Obamacare, the Dodd-Frank Act or any number of other programs, it can and should die a quiet legislative death.\n\nIf Republicans are really interested in a conservative agenda for America, enacting a sunset provision for Obamacare and every other law enacted by Congress is a very good start.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If Republicans really want a conservative agenda, enacting a sunset provision for Obamacare and every other law is a good start.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "If Republicans really want a conservative agenda, enacting a sunset provision for Obamacare and every other law is a good start.", "title": "PHILLIPS: How to end Obamacare", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/25/phillips-how-to-end-obamacare/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/11/24/obamajpeg-0383e.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/11/24/obamajpeg-0383e.jpg", "description": "If Republicans really want a conservative agenda, enacting a sunset provision for Obamacare and every other law is a good start.", "card": "summary", "title": "PHILLIPS: How to end Obamacare"}, "Author": "Judson Phillips", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Congress, Barack Obama"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce4e3\"", "article_summary": "They should support a sunset provision for Obamacare, then run in 2016 on reauthorizing Obamacare.\nThere is a strategy that will work to repeal Obamacare, if the Republican leadership will act on it.\nAll the House leadership has to do is attach a sunset provision for Obamacare to a piece of must-pass legislation.\nThe House leadership is not making a real effort to repeal Obamacare.\nWhile the majority of Americans want Obamacare repealed, Republicans in Congress lack the leadership to do anything about it."}
