Grubergate, gruberish, grubered, grubermania, moneygrubering and gruberpalooza are among the new terms that have sprung into public use, these inspired by one particular economist who made an unfortunate comment about Obamcare, transparency and the mental capacity of Americans recently. But such things spawn instant culture. All the new nouns and verbs - some capitalized, some not - are now appearing in multiple print and online reports from Time, Bloomberg, Fox News, Powerline, Lucianne.com and many other sources. What with Twitter hashtags and jaunty dialogue, the usage has been spirited in recent days.

“How about you man up, Stewart, and admit you were grubered into selling that Obamacare [expletive],” Fox News host Eric Bolling advised John Stewart, a rival host on Comedy Central.

“I think that no other word describes what we have seen in the climate debate quite as well as grubering. The Climategate emails are full of discussions about how to ‘sell’ the public on catastrophic anthropogenic global warming through a campaign of lies and exaggerations. There are many discussion about how the public could not possibly understand such a complex subject. ‘Climate grubering’ — its a powerful new word that can help us to describe what’s been going on,” notes Watts Up With That, a popular blog covering climate change and global warming.”

So now there are denialists, skeptics, warmists, alarmists and gruberists,” responded one reader on Sunday.
