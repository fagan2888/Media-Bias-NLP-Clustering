She shared the lecture\u2019s stage with Nicole Alexander-Scott, director of the Rhode Island Department of Health, who said that addressing the social and environmental determinants of health are necessary to reduce disparities. Doing so is among her top three priorities in office, Alexander-Scott says.\n\nFrom the start of life\n\nThe foundation of Paxson\u2019s remarks was her presentation of data illustrating that the differences between blacks and whites in the United States occur across many dimensions that economists consider in models of how health is determined.\n\nOn average, black people are more likely to start life with low birth weight and poorer overall health quality. They are less likely to earn a college degree, and make less money on average. The average black household has starkly less total wealth than the average white household\u2014$11,000 vs. $190,000 in 2013. By many measures, black people receive worse health care services than whites do.\n\nAt the same time, the data show that black people had higher mortality and infant mortality rates than any other US ethnic group in 2005. Black people were also more likely to report worse overall health, and higher rates of specific conditions such as arthritis, heart conditions, stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, and breathing disorders. Moreover, they reported in the National Health Interview Study that they were more likely to be limited in working because of these conditions.\n\n\u201cAnd there were different reasons for this,\u201d Paxson said, listing \u201cearlier onset of conditions; less ability to control the progression of the disease because of poorer quality medical care or worse environmental factors; [and] less income or wealth\u2014and we saw the wealth gaps\u2014that are needed to buffer the effects of the disease or the condition on the quality of life.\u201d\n\nOne effect evident in the data is that black people often report reaching levels of ill health quality\u2014\u201dmorbidity\u201d\u2014about a decade before white people do. Yet, Paxson said, when people can\u2019t work in their 50s because of poor health, they miss out on the prime earning years when they need to save for retirement.\n\nNo single solution\n\nThere isn\u2019t one lone factor that can account for the disparities in health. Paxson crunched numbers to find that even if blacks had the same rate of college education as whites, the disparities would narrow, but still would not close completely. It\u2019s also a problem that can\u2019t be solved solely by the expansion of health insurance provided by the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the data, you look at the studies, I come away with the sense that this is just a complex mix of lower wealth, higher stress, greater discrimination, and lower economic opportunities,\u201d Paxson says. \u201cAnd this mix all feeds in to a life course of disadvantage that cumulates in higher morbidity and eventually higher mortality.\u201d\n\nThe cumulative nature of the negative interplay of poverty, discrimination, less education, and lower health quality requires early and sustained intervention, Paxson says.\n\nImproving maternal and neonatal health, improving early child development and education, and treating chronic conditions such as high-blood pressure and obesity that lead to larger health problems are all important examples, but so are ending educational and economic disparities later throughout life.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we are really going to solve this problem until we dismantle structural barriers to social and economic opportunity,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a really big order but it\u2019s one we really need to focus on.\u201d\n\nBasic living conditions\n\nAlexander-Scott said racial disparities in Rhode Island require an emphasis not only on the delivery of health care in the hospital or the doctor\u2019s office, but also on the living conditions of people in the community as a whole. Those are the social and environmental determinants of health.\n\n\u201cWhen you give them that scrip, do you know if they have the transportation to get them to the pharmacy to pick it up?\u201d said Alexander-Scott, an alumna who is also an assistant professor in the Alpert Medical School and the School of Public Health. \u201cDo they have the electricity to refrigerate the medication that we have given them the script for?\u201d\n\nAlexander-Scott noted that the US spends much more than other countries on health and gets only middle-of-the-pack results in life expectancy. Meanwhile, the country spends much less than others on social support services.\n\nSource: Brown University", "article_metadata": {"description": "No one factor accounts for racial health disparities, said economist Christina Paxson in a lecture.
