An increasing number of states are moving to enact 20-week abortion bans under the guise of preventing pain that scientists agree doesn\u2019t actually exist. But Montana is taking an even more creative approach.\n\nUnder House Bill 479, drafted by State Rep. Albert Olszewski, abortion doctors would be required to administer anesthesia to fetuses past the 20th week of pregnancy. The measure states that \u201csubstantial scientific evidence recognizes that an unborn child is capable of experiencing physical pain and suffering by not later than 20 weeks after fertilization\u201d and the state has a \u201ccompelling interest\u201d in preventing that.\n\nRep. Olszewski\u2019s bill would not technically ban abortion procedures altogether after 20 weeks of pregnancy. But, by requiring doctors to follow a medically unnecessary protocol for administering anesthesia, it could impose significant barriers to later abortions. The providers in the state still aren\u2019t sure exactly what the legislation would mean for their day-to-day work.\n\n\u201cWhat is necessary to provide this service? Is there special equipment? Is there a level of expertise that physicians wouldn\u2019t have? Do you need to bring in an anesthesiologist?\u201d Martha Stahl, the CEO of Planned Parenthood of Montana, pointed out to ThinkProgress. \u201cAll of those questions remain to be answered.\u201d\n\nDr. Joey Banks, a doctor who provides abortion services at a clinic in Missoula, echoed those sentiments. \u201cFor elective procedures in this state, if this were law, it would probably mean abortion providers could not continue to provide after 20 weeks at least for a while while they determined costs, safety, and provider availability,\u201d Banks told ThinkProgress via email.\n\nAlthough HB 479 is cloaked in the language of compassion, reproductive health advocates in the state say it could actually compromise women\u2019s health. Adding fetal anesthesia to an abortion procedure would ultimately make the process more expensive and more medically risky. Later abortions are already particularly costly \u2014 reaching up to $6,531 in some states \u2014 and raising the price tag even further could burden patients. Plus, Banks noted that some women may have to travel farther to have a later abortion procedure if the clinic closest to their home doesn\u2019t have a neonatal anesthesiologist available.\n\nOlszewski, who is an orthopedic surgeon specializing in knee surgery, has not yet responded to a ThinkProgress request for comment about his proposed legislation.\n\nThe concept of fetal anesthesia for abortion procedures didn\u2019t originate in Montana. It\u2019s the next step in a carefully coordinated strategy being pioneered by pro-life activists who want to narrow the window for legal abortion services by casting the medical procedure as barbaric, and arguing that fetuses are suffering in pain.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about highlighting this idea of fetal pain, and sort of making the fetus seem more human,\u201d Elizabeth Nash, the states issues manager at the Guttmacher Institute, told ThinkProgress.\n\nAccording to Nash, who closely tracks these type of state restrictions, the mid-2000s brought a rush of new legislation requiring abortion doctors to counsel their patients with biased information about the risks of having an abortion. Some of these so-called \u201cinformed consent\u201d measures stipulated that doctors needed to tell women their fetus may feel pain during an abortion. A few states included provisions forcing doctors to offer their patients the option of using fetal anesthesia.\n\nBy 2010, states started going a step further and enacting 20-week abortion bans based on the spurious legal claim that states are allowed to prohibit abortions to prevent fetal pain. Several states have banned later abortions even though none of the clinics there actually offer abortion services past 20 weeks of pregnancy, which makes the laws harder to challenge. At this point, the policy is on the books in 14 different states and has increasingly been pushed on the national level, too.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that fetuses can feel pain before the point of viability, and even the scientists who have pioneered the study of fetal pain never wanted their research to be used to justify abortion restrictions. When women receive fetal anesthesia for other surgical procedures, like operations on their unborn child\u2019s organs, the drug is administered not necessarily to prevent pain but rather to inhibit the fetus\u2019 movement.\n\n\u201cFrom a medical standpoint, this just doesn\u2019t really make sense,\u201d Nash said, adding that abortion opponents are \u201cgetting a lot of mileage out of unsubstantiated ideas.\u201d\n\nThe only other state that\u2019s ever considered mandating fetal anesthesia during abortion procedures is West Virginia. Lawmakers in Montana are the first to link the requirement to the arbitrary 20-week mark.\n\nFetal pain is hardly the only type of abortion measure that enshrines anti-science notions into law. Several common restrictions \u2014 including unnecessary ultrasound requirements, biased counseling sessions, mandatory waiting periods, and regulations on the abortion pill \u2014 also fall neatly into this category because they\u2019re not justified by any medical purpose. According to a recent report from the National Partnership for Women & Families, 33 states currently have at least one of those \u201cbad medicine\u201d laws on the books.\n\nHB 479 is up for debate in a health committee on Wednesday afternoon. Stahl said she isn\u2019t sure why the Montana legislature opted for a proposed fetal anesthesia requirement rather than a more straightforward 20-week abortion ban. But she said that \u201cit definitely should be a heads up to other states.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "They're taking the concept of \"fetal pain\" to the next level.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "They're taking the concept of \"fetal pain\" to the next level.", "title": "\u2018Fetal Anesthesia\u2019: The Creative New Way To Limit Abortion Access And Enshrine Bad Science Into Law", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/03/11/3632273/montana-fetal-pain-bill/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/AP623553629940.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "They're taking the concept of \"fetal pain\" to the next level.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/AP623553629940-321x214.jpg", "title": "\u2018Fetal Anesthesia\u2019: The Creative New Way To Limit Abortion Access And Enshrine Bad Science Into Law", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/AP623553629940.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/AP623553629940.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-11T10:11:07+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd74a1\"", "article_summary": "Adding fetal anesthesia to an abortion procedure would ultimately make the process more expensive and more medically risky.\nThe concept of fetal anesthesia for abortion procedures didn\u2019t originate in Montana.\nFetal pain is hardly the only type of abortion measure that enshrines anti-science notions into law.\nStahl said she isn\u2019t sure why the Montana legislature opted for a proposed fetal anesthesia requirement rather than a more straightforward 20-week abortion ban.\nA few states included provisions forcing doctors to offer their patients the option of using fetal anesthesia."}
