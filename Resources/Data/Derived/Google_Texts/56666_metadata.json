As the car left the city and wound through the snow-blanketed woods of the Hudson River Valley, she talked about vampire movies, praising Tomas Alfredson\u2019s \u201cLet the Right One In,\u201d and about some of her travels: More recently, to San Diego Comic-Con, where \u201cI had my picture taken with the Klingons,\u201d but also, when she was a young mother, to Afghanistan a few weeks before the 1978 assassination of President Mohammed Daoud Khan and to Iran eight months before the overthrow of the shah. \u201cDon\u2019t invite me to your country,\u201d she recommended.\n\nAtwood\u2019s destination on this trip, although unlikely enough, was probably safe from a coup. The entire first-year class of cadets at West Point had read her 1985 novel, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d for a literature course. The 75-year-old author agreed to speak to the assembled plebes (as first-year students at the military academy are called) after lunching with them on mac-and-cheese under the gothic arches of the campus\u2019 vast, Hogwartsian mess hall.\n\n\u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d is set in a dystopian future not too distant from the current date. A totalitarian theocratic regime has taken over portions of the U.S., where the narrator, a young woman known only as Offred (as in \u201cof Fred,\u201d for the man in whose household she lives) has been consigned to the status of a Handmaid. Her only role, as one of the few women whose fertility has survived decades of environmental contamination, is to provide the Commander with a child via a ritualized and joyless act of copulation. In this future, women must wear color-coded, body-concealing robes and are not allowed to hold jobs outside the home, to own property, to live on their own or even to read.\n\nThe novelist\u2019s visit to West Point commenced with a signing in the campus bookstore. Students and faculty in camo and uniforms lined up with a handful of awestruck local high school students, artsy girls in overalls or ballet flats with kitten faces on the toes. West Point\u2019s current student body is only 22 percent female, but that\u2019s an improvement on past years. To walk its halls is to enter a realm of testosterone and old-fashioned manners. A woman of a certain age (say, over 30) can expect to hear more ma\u2019ams there in one afternoon than in a lifetime of visits to dress shops.\n\n\u201cReading this book was a life-changing experience,\u201d a bright, well-scrubbed plebe enthused as he handed Atwood a worn paperback of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d to sign. \u201cThat\u2019s a frightening thought,\u201d she quipped in her nasal deadpan. \u201cWhat were you like before?\u201d\n\nFor many years, readers not especially familiar with Atwood\u2019s work assumed \u2014 largely on the basis of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d her homage to George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d \u2014 that she and her work were, as her fellow novelist Karen Joy Fowler once put it, \u201cCanadian, feminist and grim.\u201d The first two adjectives definitely apply, although Atwood\u2019s feminism has never been of the essentialist or idealizing variety; one of her abiding subjects is the ways women undermine each other, as well as the sustaining power of their friendships. She is the daughter of an entomologist (one of her childhood pets was a praying mantis that she trained to drink sugar water out of a spoon), and she often seems to be observing humanity with the dispassionate, unstarry eyes of a scientist.\n\n\u201cGrim\u201d is the word that doesn\u2019t fit here, even if Atwood\u2019s sense of humor is consistently charcoal in hue. The advent of the Internet and social media have acquainted a much wider audience with her puckish side \u2014 literally, in the case of the YouTube dissemination of a clip from a Canadian TV series featuring the diminutive Atwood out on the ice in full goalie gear, explaining her approach to hockey\u2019s most strategic position. (\u201cI don\u2019t like to hot dog, but if the puck carrier is really putting lumber on it, mama can get nasty.\u201d) She\u2019s a wisecracker, albeit a dignified one, so that her manner seems equal parts duchess and film-noir dame.\n\nAtwood currently has 640,000 followers on Twitter, where she promotes favored causes, particularly environmentalism, and has bantered flirtatiously with the comedian Rob Delaney, a fan of her work. She has communed and collaborated with young amateur writers on the site Wattpad, which has given her a Wattpad business card with the title \u201cFairy Godmother.\u201d She even voiced the part of herself in a fitness app called \u201cZombies, Run!\u201d in which users are motivated to exercise with a zombie-apocalypse scenario. (In the app, she\u2019s holed up in the CN tower in Toronto, sending transmissions relating the undead takeover of NHL Hockey.) During the drive up to West Point, she chatted about recent articles in Fast Company magazine and her own start-up, marketer of the LongPen, a remote signing device she invented.\n\nFor the dozen or so plebes seated at Atwood\u2019s table during the institution\u2019s impressively brisk half-hour lunch period, however, she was a venerable figure, with dozens of books to her name and a Booker Prize under her belt, among other honors. She answered some familiar inquiries \u2014 about the ambiguity of the ending of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d and how long it took her to write the novel (\u201cone and half years, and a lifetime\u201d) \u2014 but she also managed to quiz each cadet on the mascot of his or her company. \u201cI thought they\u2019d all be animals, but one is a firehouse,\u201d she exclaimed. One cadet carried a notebook onto which she\u2019d laminated the image of a wolf. Atwood and the student discussed the various lamination devices currently available on the consumer market \u2014 Atwood loves technology \u2014 although the cadet explained that she\u2019d just used packing tape. \u201cPacking tape works very well, too,\u201d Atwood said approvingly.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The celebrated author speaks to a class of military academy cadets about her dystopian novel \"The Handmaid's Tale\"", "title": "Margaret Atwood visits West Point for a frank conversation on gender, politics and oppression", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The celebrated author speaks to a class of military academy cadets about her dystopian novel \"The Handmaid's Tale\"", "title": "Margaret Atwood visits West Point for a frank conversation on gender, politics and oppression", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/08/margaret_atwood_visits_west_point_for_a_frank_conversation_on_gender_politics_and_oppression/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/margaret_atwood_west_point.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The celebrated author speaks to a class of military academy cadets about her dystopian novel \"The Handmaid's Tale\"", "title": "Margaret Atwood visits West Point for a frank conversation on gender, politics and oppression", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/margaret_atwood_west_point.jpg", "creator": "@magiciansbook", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Laura Miller", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Editor's Picks, Education, Fiction, Margaret Atwood, The Handmaid's Tale, West Point", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc88f\"", "article_summary": "The entire first-year class of cadets at West Point had read her 1985 novel, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d for a literature course.\nThe novelist\u2019s visit to West Point commenced with a signing in the campus bookstore.\n\u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d is set in a dystopian future not too distant from the current date.\nDuring the drive up to West Point, she chatted about recent articles in Fast Company magazine and her own start-up, marketer of the LongPen, a remote signing device she invented.\n\u201cReading this book was a life-changing experience,\u201d a bright, well-scrubbed plebe enthused as he handed Atwood a worn paperback of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d to sign."}
