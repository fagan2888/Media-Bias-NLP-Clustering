And I get to meet those people when they\u2019re adults, and productive adults. There is no way you\u2019re going to convince me that they\u2019re not important, that they\u2019re just a mass of cells.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanna ask you this,\u201d Goldberg countered. \u201cHave you met with the women who have to make these horrendous decisions when they have to make them, of whether or not they can bring a child into the world? We talk about bringing children into the world all the time, but periodically, some women feel, \u2018I just can\u2019t.\u2019 Are you empathetic to them?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very empathetic,\u201d Carson replied. \u201cWhat I have said is that this is a job for us in the private sector. What we need to do is make sure that we provide adequate day-care centers for these mothers so that they can get their GED\u2026\u201d\n\nGoldberg then interrupted to ask about educated mothers, mothers who are simply \u201cmaking that decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me tell you a fact,\u201d she continued. \u201cA lot of those young girls who are having babies out of wedlock, when they have that first baby, they stop their education, and that child is four times more likely to grow up in poverty. We as a society have an obligation to do what\u2019s necessary to stop that cycle from occurring.\u201d\n\nCo-host Joy Behar then chimed in to ask Carson whether the Republican Party believes in the other services Planned Parenthood provides, including birth control and mammograms (since debunked).\n\nCarson responded by saying he does not speak for the Republican Party, but that he does support birth control.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I believe in,\u201d Carson added calmly, \u201cbecause I get sick and tired of people, particularly progressives, saying \u2018Carson grew up poor, he must have benefitted from government programs and now he wants to withdraw all these programs.\u2019 I\u2019ve heard that so many times. It\u2019s a bunch of crap. What I really want to do is provide people with a mechanism for coming out of a state of dependency, and climbing the ladder and becoming part of the fabric of America.\u201d\n\nA visibly agitated Behar then asked Carson how he could compare Obamacare to slavery when \u201c19 million people have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you why,\u201d Carson said. \u201cBecause this is supposed to be a country that is of, by and for the people. The government is supposed to be there to facilitate life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. With this particular act, the government comes along and says, \u2018Don\u2019t care what you people think, this is what we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re cramming it down your throat, and if you don\u2019t like it, too bad.\u2019 It shifts the relationship between the people and the government. The people are supposed to be at the pinnacle. The government works for us. It\u2019s not the other way around. We need to restore that.\n\nLast month, Goldberg blasted critics of Planned Parenthood on the program, telling them to \u201cGet out of my vagina!\u201c", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican presidential contender Dr. Ben Carson appeared on ABC's The View on Tuesday, where he defended his pro-life stance on abortion under questioning from co-host Whoopi Goldberg.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Republican presidential contender Dr. Ben Carson appeared on ABC's The View on Tuesday, where he defended his pro-life stance on abortion under questioning from co-host Whoopi Goldberg.", "title": "Watch: Ben Carson Stands Up for Pro-Life Movement on 'The View' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Carson-View-Screen-Youtube.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2015/10/06/watch-ben-carson-stands-pro-life-movement-view/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republican presidential contender Dr. Ben Carson appeared on ABC's The View on Tuesday, where he defended his pro-life stance on abortion under questioning from co-host Whoopi Goldberg.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Carson-View-Screen-Youtube.jpg", "title": "Watch: Ben Carson Stands Up for Pro-Life Movement on 'The View' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Abortion, Ben Carson, Joy Behar, Planned Parenthood, The View, Whoopi Goldberg,Abortion, Big Hollywood, Faith,Carson", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Abortion", "tag": "Whoopi Goldberg", "published_time": "2015-10-06T13:11:54-07:00", "categories": "Big Hollywood,Faith,Abortion"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1be2\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u201cYou sort of feel that there\u2019s not a war on women, but there may be a war on what\u2019s inside of women,\u201d Goldberg told Carson.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERRepublican presidential contender Dr. Ben Carson appeared on ABC\u2019s The View on Tuesday, where he defended his pro-life stance on abortion under questioning from co-host Whoopi Goldberg.\nCarson responded by saying he does not speak for the Republican Party, but that he does support birth control.\n\u201cIs that accurate?\u201d\u201cWe are killing babies all over the place,\u201d Carson responded.\nLast month, Goldberg blasted critics of Planned Parenthood on the program, telling them to \u201cGet out of my vagina!\u201c"}
