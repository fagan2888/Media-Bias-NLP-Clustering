Brent could have been sentenced to up to 20 years in prison.\n\nBrent, who turns 26 next week, closed his eyes when the judge read the jury\u2019s verdict. He remained in custody after the hearing.\n\nOne of his attorneys, Kevin Brooks, described the former defensive tackle as \u201csomber.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really kind of overwhelmed with the results,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of what we\u2019ve been fighting for from Day 1. I\u2019m happy for Josh. Josh is still sad and grieving and that\u2019s something he\u2019s going to carry with him the rest of his life.\u201d\n\nBrent\u2019s family members of cried and hugged as the courtroom emptied after the hearing. His mother, LaTasha Brent, spoke briefly as she left the courthouse, saying she was there to support her son.\n\nBrown\u2019s mother, Stacey Jackson, wasn\u2019t in the courtroom when the verdict was read. She publicly forgave Brent, and when asked during the sentencing proceedings if she holds him responsible for her son\u2019s death, she said: \u201cHe\u2019s still responsible, but you can\u2019t go on in life holding a grudge. We all make mistakes.\u201d\n\nBrent and Brown, a linebacker on the practice squad, also played together at the University of Illinois and were close friends. They were headed home from a night of partying with Dallas teammates when Brent lost control of his Mercedes and crashed. Officers who arrived on scene saw Brent trying to pull Brown\u2019s body from the wreckage.\n\nBlood tests pegged Brent\u2019s blood alcohol content at 0.18 percent, which is more than twice the state\u2019s legal limit to drive of 0.08 percent. Prosecutors told jurors that the burly, 320-pound lineman had as many as 17 drinks on the night of the crash.\n\n\u201cWe never quarrel with a jury\u2019s decision,\u201d said lead prosecutor Heath Harris, who passionately urged the jury to send Brent to prison. \u201cAll we can hope and pray is that I believe the jury saw something salvageable in him \u2026 and he does get some help.\u201d\n\nOne of Brent\u2019s attorneys, George Milner, argued that Brent wasn\u2019t drunk and was only \u201cguilty of being stupid behind the wheel of a car.\u201d He contended that Brent couldn\u2019t have had nearly as much to drink as prosecutors said he had, and that the police blood tests were flawed.\n\nBrent\u2019s attorneys pushed their case for probation Thursday, calling a Dallas County official who testified that the county currently has 34 intoxication manslaughter cases that resulted in probation.\n\nProsecutors pushed for prison time for Brent, who went to trial only weeks after another Texas intoxication manslaughter case sparked widespread public outrage. In that case, a defense expert argued that the defendant, a 17-year-old boy who caused a drunken crash that killed four people, deserved leniency because his parents coddled him into a sense of irresponsibility \u2014 a condition the expert termed \u201caffluenza.\u201d The teen wasn\u2019t given prison time.\n\nOn Thursday, prosecutor Rebecca Dodds emphasized Brent\u2019s 2009 drunken driving arrest in Illinois to press the state\u2019s argument that he deserves prison time. In that case, he served 30 days in jail after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor charge.\n\n\u201cProbation doesn\u2019t work for Josh Brent,\u201d Dodds told the jury during closing statements in the punishment phase.\n\nBrent, who retired from football last year, played in all 12 games for the Cowboys in 2012 before the crash. Brown made the practice squad that season.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Ex-Cowboys player Josh Brent gets 180 days in jail for death of former teammate", "title": "Ex-Cowboys player Josh Brent gets 180 days in jail for death of former teammate", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/24/ex-cowboys-player-josh-brent-gets-180-days-in-jail-for-death-of-former-teammate/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140124__p_eea7b5b5-cd7e-4d8b-a849-e4b9118a87b4lsoriginalph.jpg", "height": 425}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140124__p_eea7b5b5-cd7e-4d8b-a849-e4b9118a87b4lsoriginalph.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-24T14:33:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T08:19:45+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaac9\"", "article_summary": "\u201cProbation doesn\u2019t work for Josh Brent,\u201d Dodds told the jury during closing statements in the punishment phase.\nDALLAS \u2014 Former Dallas Cowboys player Josh Brent avoided prison Friday and instead was sentenced to 180 days in jail and 10 years of probation for a drunken car crash that killed his friend and teammate, Jerry Brown.\nProsecutors pushed for prison time for Brent, who went to trial only weeks after another Texas intoxication manslaughter case sparked widespread public outrage.\n\u201cWe never quarrel with a jury\u2019s decision,\u201d said lead prosecutor Heath Harris, who passionately urged the jury to send Brent to prison.\nBrent, who retired from football last year, played in all 12 games for the Cowboys in 2012 before the crash."}
