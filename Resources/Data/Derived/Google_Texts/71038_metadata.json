So she made a rap video for him.\n\nIjoy says she\u2019s been a fan of Obama since 2008, and as his presidency winds down, she wanted to express her gratitude through song. \u201cI sit in here my rocking chair, my mind begins to wander / Grandmom thinks it\u2019s time to say thank you to Obama,\u201d she raps.\n\nNow that \u201cGrandmomma gets funky for Obama!\u201d has been viewed nearly 150,000 times on Facebook, Ijoy is encouraging others to thank the president for his service too. \u201cPut your pen or pencil or social media right where your mouth is,\u201d she told me over the phone Tuesday morning.\n\nIjoy says she doesn\u2019t expect to see another black president in her lifetime, and she\u2019s concerned about the state of politics as we enter the next presidency. \u201cPeople of different genders and women and immigrants are being excluded,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s fueling vitriol, and that\u2019s going to be sad.\u201d\n\nBelow is a conversation, edited for length and clarity, with Dr. Ijoy, a family therapist whose website is appropriately named listentograndmomma.com.\n\nDr. Ijoy, this isn\u2019t your first musical tribute to the president. A few months ago, your granddaughter Lucille, who is a dear friend of mine, sent around \u201cPresident Obama, You\u2019re Doing a Realllllll Good Job.\u201d It\u2019s my personal favorite.\n\nOh, yes. I got a letter from the president and his wife and two daughters and Sunny and Bo thanking me. Just a nice letter. I also did buttons\u2014I\u2019m going to send a whole box to Lucille. The buttons say, \u201cPresident Obama, you\u2019re doing a realllllll good job.\u201d And the president sent a thank you note for those, too.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dr. Lucille Ijoy, an 84-year-old grandmother from Philadelphia, really likes President Obama.
