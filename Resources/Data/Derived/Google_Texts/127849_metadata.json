San Francisco, Calif.-based LiveRail helps media companies sell video ads programmatically. The company, sometimes referred to in ad tech circles as a \u201csupply side\u201d platform, works with clients such as A&E, Univision, Major League Baseball and BET. According to Facebook, LiveRail\u2019s ambition is to become integral to the fast growing online video advertising business.\n\n\u201cWhat LiveRail ultimately offers is a complete advertising solution for video publishers,\u201d Brian Boland, Vice President of Ads Product Marketing and Atlas at Facebook, wrote in a blog post.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how that mission fits in with Facebook. While the social networking giant is ramping up its own Web video ad strategy with auto-play video ads (ads that run automatically on the site when users encounter them in their news feeds) Facebook hasn\u2019t been as focused up to now on helping other media companies make more money with online ads.That of course is something that rival Google has been very focused on (in fact, Google just rolled out an ad exchange specifically for premium video content).\n\n\u201cThey may not feel like they are capturing as big a share of video advertising right now, at least where it is moving most rapidly,\u201d theorized Donnie Williams, Chief Digital Officer at Horizon Media. Mr. Williams was referring both to original video content, which Facebook doesn\u2019t really do, and video ads sold using sophisticated software and technology.\n\nThat said, Facebook continues to push further into programmatic advertising. It manages its own ad exchange and has recently launched a mobile ad network and started targeting its users with ads based in part on their recent Web browsing. Facebook also acquired the ad serving company Atlas from Microsoft in early 2013. That company is mostly focused on display ads rather than video.\n\n\u201cThis is an excellent acquisition and consistent with the acquisition of Atlas, indicating an aggressive push to expand Facebook advertising and data to inventory outside of Facebook\u2019s owned media,\u201d said Brian Lesser, CEO of GroupM\u2019s programmatic buying firm Xaxis.\n\nMike Henry, CEO of the Web video advertising firm Outrigger Media, theorized that Facebook has its eye on expanding its influence in digital advertising. \u201cLiveRail gives them access to video inventory that wasn\u2019t going to happen organically,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a strong signal that their ad business needs to grow beyond the walls of Facebook.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Facebook is touting LiveRail\u2019s ability to make Web video ads better for the entire online ad ecosystem.\n\n\u201cWe believe that LiveRail, Facebook and the premium publishers it serves have an opportunity to make video ads better and more relevant for the hundreds of millions of people who watch digital video every month,\u201d Mr. Boland wrote. \u201cMore relevant ads will be more interesting and engaging to people watching online video, and more effective for marketers too. Publishers will benefit as well because more relevant ads will help them make the most out of every opportunity they have to show an ad.\u201d\n\nFacebook is saying that LiveRail\u2019s technology makes advertising more relevant and interesting. An obvious question is, could Facebook\u2019s rich trove of data on its users, combined with that technology, make those ads that much more relevant? Facebook isn\u2019t currently positioning the deal that way\u2013but it\u2019s interesting to consider, especially if Facebook wants to challenge Google and others in the emerging battle for Web video ad platform supremacy.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "[wsj-ticker ticker=\"FB\" onlinesignificance=\"prominent\" name=\"Facebook\" postfix=\"\"]\u00a0is\u00a0diving deeper into the Web video advertising business.
