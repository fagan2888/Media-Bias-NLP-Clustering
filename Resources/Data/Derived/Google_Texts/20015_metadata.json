[Video]\n\nIt\u2019s Labor Day, and while I\u201dm mostly looking for ways to relax, I\u2019m also thinking about the connection between our working lives and our environmental impact (because that\u2019s the kind of things I do when I relax!). We\u2019ve touched on this concept before, but the TED talk below takes an even more radical approach to shortening the work week as a way to address natural resource consumption\u2026 as well as deal with elements of social and economic sustainability.\n\nAnna Coote first proposed this concept in a 2010 report for the New Economics Foundation; she gave the talk below at TEDxGhent in 2012. She makes a compelling case for a gradual shift to a 21-hour work week as an answer (though not a \u201csilver bullet,\u201d nor the only answer ) for overconsumption, work-related stress, underemployment, and family dysfunction\u2026 in addition to climate change and other environmental challenges.\n\nTake a few minutes (OK, twenty) to listen to Coote\u2019s argument, and then let us know what you think. Feel free to wait until later in the week, US readers \u2013 it is a holiday, after all! Happy Labor Day!\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nMore\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Sustainablog", "description": "Anna Coote argues that we could address environmental and social concerns by shortening the standard work week to 21 hours over time.", "title": "Is a Shorter Work Week More Sustainable?", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://sustainablog.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/time-for-a-shorter-work-week.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://sustainablog.org/2014/09/shorter-work-week-lead-sustainable-lives/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "Culture", "tag": "work week", "published_time": "2014-09-01T13:25:36-04:00"}, "description": "Anna Coote argues that we could address environmental and social concerns by shortening the standard work week to 21 hours over time.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "robots": "noodp"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca8a7\"", "article_summary": "Would a Shorter Work Week Lead to More Sustainable Lives?\nFeel free to wait until later in the week, US readers \u2013 it is a holiday, after all!\nWe\u2019ve touched on this concept before, but the TED talk below takes an even more radical approach to shortening the work week as a way to address natural resource consumption\u2026 as well as deal with elements of social and economic sustainability.\nShe makes a compelling case for a gradual shift to a 21-hour work week as an answer (though not a \u201csilver bullet,\u201d nor the only answer ) for overconsumption, work-related stress, underemployment, and family dysfunction\u2026 in addition to climate change and other environmental challenges.\nTake a few minutes (OK, twenty) to listen to Coote\u2019s argument, and then let us know what you think."}
