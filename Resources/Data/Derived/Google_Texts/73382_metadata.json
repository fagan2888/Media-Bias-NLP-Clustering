He also said that the department would use aggregate data from the complaint system to judge the performance of its loan servicers, in addition to the current metrics it uses.\n\nThe department will also study how it should collect and resolve complaints it receives about colleges and universities, such as poor educational quality or misleading claims. Department officials will explore ways to improve how the department refers \"possible violations of laws and regulations to other enforcement,\" the White House said.\n\nSome of the other executive actions are designed, officials said, to improve and standardize the customer service experience of federal student loan borrowers.\n\nFor example, the Department of Education will establish a single Web site where all federal loan borrowers can access their account and payment information. Borrowers currently have to visit the Web site of whichever of the dozen federal loan servicers has been assigned to manage their account.\n\nThe department also plans to direct its contracted loan servicers to provide \"enhanced disclosures\" when their loans are transferred between servicers and to more aggressively reach out when borrowers fall behind in their payments or need help changing repayment plans.\n\nIn addition, the department will instruct its loan servicers to apply \"prepayments\" -- money a borrower pays in excess of his or her monthly minimum -- to the loans with the highest interest rate, unless a borrower requests otherwise.\n\nThe Treasury Department will also play a role in the efforts to boost loan servicing.\n\nIt plans to launch a two-year pilot program in which the federal government will directly collect the defaulted debt of a small number of loan borrowers. The Department of Education currently contracts with private collection companies to pursue borrowers who haven't made a payment on their federal loans in more than a year.\n\nThe pilot program is aimed at gathering information to help improve the collections process for federal student loans. The administration is not considering replacing its contracted debt collection agencies with debt collection directly by the government in the program, according to Deputy Treasury Secretary Sarah Bloom Raskin.\n\n\"What we are looking to do is to put our toe in the water here to acclimate ourselves to see what is involved in student loan debt collection,\" Raskin told reporters Monday.\n\nMitchell said that having that \"experimental pool\" of defaulted loans collected directly by the government would allow the administration to test out new ways to work with struggling borrowers.\n\nHe said that the department's Office of Federal Student Aid, which oversees the direct loan program, \"is a learning organization and sees this as an enormous opportunity.\"\n\nIn addition, the Treasury Department is looking at ways to let borrowers provide multiyear authorization for the Internal Revenue Service to release the income information needed to apply for federal income-based repayment programs. Borrowers now have to fill out a form each year to receive such benefits.\n\nBeyond the executive actions to be announced Tuesday, the administration said it will convene an interagency task force to develop regulatory and legislative proposals to help struggling borrowers with both federal and private student loans.\n\nMitchell said that possible changes to bankruptcy law are among the proposals the administration will explore. Current law makes student loans more difficult to discharge than most other types of consumer debt.\n\nThe administration's efforts to improve the experience of federal student loan borrowers comes as it has received criticism from a coalition of Congressional Democrats, consumer groups, unions and student advocates.\n\nThose critics, many of whom supported the switch from bank-based to direct federal student lending in 2010, have said they're concerned that the Department of Education isn't administering the federal direct lending program -- which relies on a web of dozens of private contractors -- in a way that helps borrowers.\n\nResponding to that pressure earlier this month, the Education Department said that it would terminate its contracts with five debt collection agencies it said had provided misleading information to borrowers.\n\nJames Kvaal, the deputy director of the White House\u2019s Domestic Policy Council, said that the administration\u2019s announcement of new actions Tuesday \u201cdemonstrates another reason why student loan reform was a good idea.\u201d\n\nThe overhaul, he told reporters, put the administration \u201cin a position where we are able to continually improve our management of the program to better serve borrowers as a result.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/03/10/obama-administration-will-create-student-loan-complaint-system-centralized-payments", "image": "https://www.insidehighered.com/sites/all/themes/ihecustom/images/facebook_icon_large.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "President Obama announced a series of executive actions aimed at improving and centralizing the customer service experience of borrowers with federal student loans.", "title": "Obama administration will create student loan complaint system, centralized payments for borrowers"}, "msapplication-config": "/IEconfig.xml", "description": "President Obama announced a series of executive actions aimed at improving and centralizing the customer service experience of borrowers with federal student loans.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "follow, index"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf3ae\"", "article_summary": "WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration announced Tuesday that it plans to create a centralized complaint system for federal student loan borrowers as well as a single Web site where they can manage their loan payments.\nSome of the other executive actions are designed, officials said, to improve and standardize the customer service experience of federal student loan borrowers.\nThe administration's efforts to improve the experience of federal student loan borrowers comes as it has received criticism from a coalition of Congressional Democrats, consumer groups, unions and student advocates.\nBorrowers currently have to visit the Web site of whichever of the dozen federal loan servicers has been assigned to manage their account.\nThe pilot program is aimed at gathering information to help improve the collections process for federal student loans."}
