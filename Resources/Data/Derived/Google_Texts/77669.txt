A Wichita organization is holding a shoe drive, collecting wearable shoes that can be donated to impoverished countries.

HOPE Inc. is trying to collect 20,000 pairs of shoes. The shoes would be going to countries like Haiti, Somalia and South American countries.

"It's really sad when I look here, we have so much that we throw away here, and we look at them and they are barefoot, we look online and they have no shoes," said E. Jean Carter-Boniface, founder of HOPE Inc.

Last year, the organization collected around 7,500 shoes.

The organization Funds2Orgs pays HOPE Inc. $0.40 per pound of shoe.

"Even though it doesn't sound like much, 40 cents a pound, we are not a federal funded or state or local funded organization" Carter-Boniface said.

HOPE Inc. works in the Wichita community to bring health fairs to residents and works with people in need. The money collected would fund their efforts.

The shoe collection started on January 1, 2015 and will end on December 31, 2015.

HOPE Inc. is open Tuesday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.

People wanting to donate shoes should call (316) 618-8652.
