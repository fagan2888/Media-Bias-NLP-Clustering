Brandon Marshall spoke with confidence Friday, unable to hide his smile. He feels ready to play, even if his sprained left foot is not 100 percent. Had Sunday been a regular-season game, Marshall might not be available. But after progressing slowly during the week, Marshall is expected to be active for divisional playoff against the Colts.

The question remains: How effective can he be? Marshall, who missed the final two regular-season games after getting hurt on a tackle against the Chargers, told the Post that he expects to play either base or nickel, but likely not both. The Broncos need to keep him on a play count, and monitor him closely. Marshall sprinted for the first time on Friday. Even he doesn’t know how his foot will respond in coverage, when he must move laterally and make quick, decisive cuts.

Marshall is a tackling machine and excels in coverage. But, again, he must be watched. Linebackers Todd Davis and Steven Johnson figure to see plenty of snaps regardless of Marshall’s health.

The Broncos should be able to beat the Colts with a limited Marshall. It’s hard to see Denver beating the Patriots in New England — if Denver wins Sunday — without Marshall. Getting him back in the lineup is a start. Keeping him healthy in limited duty is equally important.
