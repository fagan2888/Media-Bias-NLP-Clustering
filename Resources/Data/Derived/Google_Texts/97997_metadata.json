Hold off until 66? Or wait until age 70 to receive the maximum benefit?\n\nIt\u2019s not always a straightforward answer. For many, it\u2019s a Sudoku puzzle or a Rubik\u2019s cube; pick your mind bender.\n\nThe Social Security retirement benefit system has tons of moving parts. Answers can vary based on whether you\u2019re healthy or not, have a spouse, are ready to retire but have school-age children, or even in some cases if you divorced after a long marriage.\n\nThe Social Security Administration estimates that 3.9 million people will turn age 62 in 2015 and another 4 million will turn 62 in 2016.\n\nIn 2014, the average age of men applying for Social Security retirement benefits was 64.4; it was 64.2 for women.\n\nHere are three issues to consider:\n\nWhat happens if I claim my benefits at age 62 but want to continue working?\n\nYou\u2019d need to consider how much you\u2019d earn at a job and how those wages might reduce your initial Social Security retirement checks.\n\nA so-called earnings test applies each year after you\u2019ve claimed benefits but only until you hit full retirement age.\n\nIf you\u2019re turning 62 in 2015 or 2016, your full retirement age is 66. (The full retirement age goes up gradually and will hit 67 for those born in 1960 and after.)\n\nIn 2015, Social Security will withhold $1 of benefits for every $2 in wages that you earn above the threshold of $15,720 if you\u2019re 62 to 65.\n\nIf you turn age 66 in 2015, the threshold that year is higher at $41,880 and then the withholding drops to $1 in benefits for each $3. But the withholding applies only for the months in 2015 before you turn 66.\n\nConfused? Another wrinkle is you might recover those lost benefits from the earnings test at your full retirement age but it\u2019s a monthly bump up.\n\nAlso, someone who switches from one Social Security benefit to another, such as a higher widow\u2019s benefit at full retirement age, won\u2019t see benefits restored, said Laurence J. Kotlikoff, co-author of Get What\u2019s Yours: The Secrets to Maxing Out Your Social Security.\n\nGood news: Investment and pension income will not count toward the earnings test, said Philip Moeller, another co-author of Get What\u2019s Yours.\n\nBad news: Earnings from jobs not covered by Social Security will count toward the earnings test.\n\nMoeller notes that the earnings test can create a cash flow challenge, which could play havoc with many budgets. Benefit reductions based on the earnings test are not prorated during the year, as you might expect. Instead, the money is taken out upfront in the year.\n\nFor example, if your outside earnings reduced your $18,000 annual Social Security retirement benefit to $12,000 the next year, you might expect a $6,000 reduction would take place over time. Maybe a $1,500 monthly payment could be reduced to $1,000 a month for an entire year? But instead you would get no Social Security payment for the first four months of that year and then receive the $1,500 payment for 8 months.\n\nOne way to avoid that wild swing is to correctly estimate your annual earnings at the beginning of the earnings year and tell Social Security. That\u2019s not always easy to do.\n\nWhat can I get if I wait?\n\nSomeone who turns 62 this year or next and claims retirement benefits at 62 might see $750 a month instead of the $1,000 that they could see at age 66. Obviously, the real number will depend on what benefits you\u2019re qualified to receive. But the reduction is about 25 percent for those claiming benefits at 62 now instead of waiting until 66.\n\n\u201cYour benefits will be much higher if you wait to collect,\u201d said Kotlikoff, a professor of economics at Boston University.\n\nAge 70 is another trigger year.\n\n\u201cYour retirement benefit is 76 percent higher, adjusted for inflation, if you start it at 70 rather than 62,\u201d Kotlikoff said.\n\nKotlikoff noted that too often people are so fixated about their fear of dying early that they want to take benefits as soon as possible. But dying is not the real risk here.\n\n\u201cThe real risk is living, living to 100 and living on cat food,\u201d Kotlikoff said. \u201cYou only need money when you\u2019re alive, it turns out. You don\u2019t need money when you\u2019re dead.\u201d\n\nIf someone is married, another reason to possibly delay collecting past 62 could be that survivor spouse benefits would increase, too.\n\nKotlikoff said he views Social Security as \u201clongevity insurance\u201d if you do not opt to just take benefits simply because you\u2019re age 62.\n\nWould other rules or options apply to you?\n\nMost people do not know the variety of benefits that could be paid out under Social Security, which is partly why the book Get What\u2019s Yours became a best seller earlier this year.\n\nOne problem with blindly claiming retirement benefits at age 62 is that some people can forgo another full benefit in the future.\n\nA 62-year-old widower might want to file to collect his survivor benefit, for example, instead of claiming his own retirement benefit at age 62. In that case, he could collect survivor benefits for eight years and then claim his own full retirement benefit when he turns age 70, Kotlikoff said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of things that can come into play, and only a computer can get it right,\u201d Kotlikoff said.\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing more financial planners and others attempt to run numbers on when to collect benefits.\n\nSometimes, 62 is just another birthday and one more reason to eat cake. It may be the time to claim a Social Security check \u2014 or not, depending on your circumstances.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The best time to apply can vary based on health, marital status, whether you will continue to work and other factors.", "og": {"description": "The best time to apply can vary based on health, marital status, whether you will continue to work and other factors.", "title": "Social Security\u2019s age-old puzzle: When to file for benefits", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150703-social-securitys-age-old-puzzle-when-to-file-for-benefits.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150703-perfi_62_il.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/perfi_62_IL.jpg", "height": 1236}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-07-04T02:25:08Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-07-04T01:35:31Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Social Security\\u2019s age-old puzzle: When to file for benefits\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150703-social-securitys-age-old-puzzle-when-to-file-for-benefits.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150703-perfi_62_il.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/perfi_62_IL.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2353843\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-07-04T01:35:31Z\", \"section\": \"Economy & You Headlines\", \"author\": \"Susan Tompor\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150703-perfi_62_il.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/perfi_62_IL.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-07-04T01:35:31Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd13b8\"", "article_summary": "In 2014, the average age of men applying for Social Security retirement benefits was 64.4; it was 64.2 for women.\nDo you file for Social Security benefits as early as possible at 62?\nThe Social Security retirement benefit system has tons of moving parts.\nYou\u2019d need to consider how much you\u2019d earn at a job and how those wages might reduce your initial Social Security retirement checks.\nIt may be the time to claim a Social Security check \u2014 or not, depending on your circumstances."}
