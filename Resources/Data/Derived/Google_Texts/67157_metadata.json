For starters, if you need a bed in a home with full-time care, the decent ones are hard to find and cost a lot.\n\nThat\u2019s why the closure of one small place in San Francisco\u2019s Potrero Hill neighborhood is being felt so acutely. The Mission Bay Convalescent Hospital served a community of elderly Chinese, most of whom didn\u2019t speak English. Now the building\u2019s been sold, its occupants scattered, and the city\u2019s supply of affordable nursing home beds is even smaller.\n\nMeanwhile, the families of these elders are helping their loved ones adjust to new and unfamiliar surroundings.\n\nJennifer Huey\u2019s mom, Chu Huey, is 80 years old and now lives in Oakland at the McClure Convalescent Hospital. She has dementia and a slew of other medical problems. She lives her life bed-bound, so everything about her existence is determined by the care she gets at McClure.\n\nChu Huey moved from Mission Bay late last year. She\u2019s one of 35 patients who left before the home closed its doors in February.\n\nShrinking Supply of Beds for Low-Income San Franciscans\n\nResidents like Chu Huey appreciated Mission Bay partly because it was familiar: There were bulletin boards with handwritten notices in Chinese, wall calendars in the good-luck colors of red and gold, and when families brought Chinese food with them, patients were surrounded with the smells of home.\n\nBut Mission Bay was housed in an aging building \u2014 first built in 1917 \u2014 and it needed major upgrades, like fire sprinklers and disabled access.\n\nMission Bay housed only Medi-Cal patients, so its revenue was limited to the reimbursement it could get, which in 2013 was $185.39 per patient per day according to the state Department of Health Care Services.\n\nIn short, costs were growing faster than the reimbursements.\n\nA lawyer for the owner, Bill Price, declined an interview request from KQED.\n\nBenson Nadell is director of the San Francisco Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program, a federally-funded patient advocate.\n\nNadell says San Francisco is steadily losing low-income nursing home beds. He estimates 900 Medi-Cal beds have disappeared over the last 20 years \u2014 about a third of the supply. None are being added.\n\n\u201cI was hoping when I first got contacted by the facility about closing, that somehow the city could have rallied around to save these beds,\u201d Nadell said. \u201cBecause everyone in there is frail elderly from San Francisco, with families living in San Francisco.\u201d\n\nBut, Nadell said families had already received written notice early last fall that they\u2019d have to leave. Given the demand for affordable beds, it became a real race to secure a spot elsewhere. The residents ended up quickly dispersing. Most of the patients at Mission Bay wanted to stay in the city. But out of 35 patients, only two were able to secure a spot in San Francisco.\n\nElderly Often Suffer \u201cTransfer Trauma\u201d\n\nAfter moving, family members now have to travel farther to see loved ones, which means fewer visits. And some Mission Bay patients moved into nursing homes where few other patients or caregivers spoke their language.\n\nThen there\u2019s what\u2019s called \u201ctransfer trauma\u201d \u2014 when a patient\u2019s health suffers just from being moved. Jennifer Huey\u2019s mother made half a dozen trips to the emergency room in the early weeks after her move out of Mission Bay.\n\nTwo other patients died shortly after they moved.\n\nOne is a 94-year-old woman who spoke only Cantonese and moved to a Kindred nursing home in Oakland at the end of October.\n\nHer oldest son is still reeling with guilt. Tam, who only wanted to use his last name, is 74. He described getting a call from the new nursing home two weeks after his mom moved in.\n\n\u201cIn the morning, they called and said she had a urinary tract infection,\u201d he said. \u201cThe doctor had given her medicine and she had taken it. But then that night, they called and said they had to send her to the hospital.\u201d\n\nThat was November 11th.\n\nTwo days later, Tam went to Oakland to visit his mom in the hospital.\n\nEarly November 14th, she died.\n\nTam says Mission Bay\u2019s closure affected his mother\u2019s health.\n\n\u201cOnce she moved to Oakland, it was not as convenient for me to visit, so I couldn\u2019t go as often,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mom was close to me, more attached to me than my other siblings. Being that far away from me affected her mood.\u201d\n\nJennifer Huey says the move has taken a real toll on patients like her mom, too. And she says Mission Bay\u2019s closure is a loss for the city as a whole.\n\n\u201cThe heart of it is, there has been nothing to replace what Mission Bay was to the Chinese community,\u201d Huey said.\n\nNadell, the patient advocate, hopes the city has a way to prevent more nursing homes from closing or leaving the city, based on financial pressure alone.\n\n\u201cI feel that individuals should not be squeezed out of the system based solely on the financial profile,\u201d he said. \u201cSan Francisco has an obligation to its old people.\u201d\n\nAs for the building itself, a local real estate dealer bought it for $2.7 million dollars.", "article_metadata": {"description": "35 Chinese immigrants, most of whom don't speak English, were displaced.
