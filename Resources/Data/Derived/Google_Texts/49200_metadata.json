Over the next 20 years, approximately 10,000 baby boomers will turn 65 every day, according to research conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2010.Another study, conducted in 2009 by the American Academy of Family Physicians, found that the number of medical students entering primary care medicine has dropped by more than 50% in the last decade.These statistics have large implications for the challenges and changes facing community pharmacy. With an increasing number of Americans seeking primary care in an overburdened health care system\u2014as the population continues to age and more patients are granted access to health care services through the Affordable Care Act\u2014national retail chains of pharmacy, such as Rite Aid, CVS, and Walgreens, are positioning themselves to be on the front lines of patient care.\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous opportunity to be at the forefront of change in community pharmacy,\u201d said Al Carter, PharmD, pharmacy affairs manager at Walgreens. \u201cThe focus on pharmacy helps drive advancements for both Walgreens and the profession as we work to shift from a dispensing role to a health care provider role.\u201dIn that expanded health care role, community pharmacists work with the overall goal of improving the health and wellness of their patients through counseling, medication therapy management, and various disease state management initiatives.CVS Caremark\u2019s Pharmacy Advisor program\u2014an initiative launched in 2011\u2014connects pharmacists with diabetes patients and those who require chronic cardiovascular care to improve adherence, manage costs, and close gaps in care.\u201cWe utilize a wide array of tools, such as phone counseling, e-mail reminders, in-store counseling, and even home consultations, to help our patients stay on their medications and ultimately stay healthy,\u201d said Papatya Tankut, RPh, vice president of pharmacy affairs at CVS Pharmacy, about the program.In addition to improving adherence and outcomes for chronic disease patients, pharmacists also play a role in protecting the overall health of their communities through immunizations.\u201cWe\u2019ve actually made [immunizations] part of our pharmacist job description,\u201d said Scott Jacobson, vice president of pharmacy at Rite Aid. \u201cSo it\u2019s an expectation on their daily services that they provide immunization services to patients.\u201dThe evolution continues as national drugstore chains continue to advance the profession by providing their pharmacists with the highest level of professional development and technology. Like the many expanded services these pharmacies now provide to patients, these improvements are centered on improving patient health.\u201cWalgreens pharmacists are encouraged to build on their training to develop relationships and improve outcomes for their patients through company-sponsored clinical programs and initiatives,\u201d said Carter.The leading drug chains also put significant resources behind helping their pharmacists achieve clinical goals by providing them with state-of-the-art tools and resources.\u201cWhen you have great automation, great work flow, it makes the process so much easier so [pharmacists] can actually move forward and take care of the patient,\u201d said Michele Belsey, vice president of college relations and professional recruitment at Rite Aid.Improved efficiency and better technology are also helping ensure that Walgreens pharmacists have more time to spend with patients in areas such as immunizations, chronic disease management, health screenings, and adherence programs.\u201cWalgreens is constantly improving our operations to allow for pharmacists to spend more time with their patients,\u201d said Carter. \u201cWe\u2019ve improved our operating systems to accommodate pharmacists by delegating more responsibilities that don\u2019t require a pharmacist\u2019s professional judgment to our certified pharmacy technicians, and we provide pharmacists with other tools that allow them to be more efficient in their professional roles.\u201dFor pharmacy students, a number of options can lead to a successful and fulfilling career in retail chain pharmacy.At pharmacy chains, pharmacists can choose to practice or advance their careers in a variety of settings, including community, infusion, and specialty pharmacy practice. \u201cOur pharmacists also have the capabilities to operate in an outpatient hospital setting for the profession, each chain seeks pharmacists with unique characteristics and professional beliefs that fit the company\u2019s mission and culture. \u201cHaving a license is the bare minimum standard every pharmacist must have,\u201d said Jacobson. \u201cBut to us, it\u2019s more about the personality that an individual has, their passion for their job, and how much they align to our A number of options can lead to a successful and fulfilling career in retail chain pharmacy. ting and collaborate with other health care professionals of the hospital,\u201d said Carter. \u201cThere\u2019s also the opportunity to pursue a career in pharmacy operations and oversee day-to-day operations of several pharmacies.\u201dCVS\u2019s Tankut said that many paths are available to CVS pharmacists as well. \u201cWhether in retail pharmacy, mail service pharmacy, specialty pharmacy or management positions, our colleagues are exposed to the many aspects of pharmacy care,\u201d she said.Belsey said that opportunities at Rite Aid can include positions in government affairs, managed care, business, legal, technology, the operations team, college relations, and recruitment.\u201cOur company\u2019s driven by pharmacy. And as such, we have a lot of roles for pharmacists within our company,\u201d Jacobson added. \u201cReally, the opportunities can be limitless.\u201dA career in community pharmacy affords pharmacists the opportunity to interact with patients on a daily basis, working toward improving their overall health.\u201cI think that for any pharmacist who has any inkling that they want to touch people\u2019s lives going into school, community pharmacy is the job to be in,\u201d said Rite Aid\u2019s Jacobson.That passion to help patients achieve improved health is the key to finding career opportunities within community pharmacy. In addition to passion for the profession, each chain seeks pharmacists with unique characteristics and professional beliefs that fit the company\u2019s mission and culture.\u201cHaving a license is the bare minimum standard every pharmacist must have,\u201d said Jacobson. \u201cBut to us, it\u2019s more about the personality that an individual has, their passion for their job, and how much they align to our standards and what we want to do as a company.\u201dBelsey added that, as a recruiter, she looks for future industry leaders. \u201cI think we really look for someone who comes in with the mindset that the practice is continually evolving and who is willing to constantly change, move forward, and to embrace that change. And not only people who are going to execute that change, but people who are going to lead those initiatives.\u201dWhen hiring, Walgreens \u201clooks for pharmacists who are active and passionate about the pharmacy profession, those who will engage their patients to stay involved in their disease management and promote a healthier lifestyle,\u201d Carter said.Tankut listed clinical knowledge, business sense, and communication skills as top qualities CVS looks for when hiring pharmacists. \u201cMost importantly, we seek out individuals who are compassionate and caring, pharmacists who really care about improving the health of our patients, and really believe in CVS Caremark\u2019s purpose\u2014 helping people on their path to better health,\u201d she said.Achieving the goal of improved patient outcomes and care will continue to take on greater significance for community pharmacists as the national health system evolves. As chains continue to expand their pharmacy as well as their health and wellness services, the career paths and growth opportunities for pharmacists will multiply as well. Pharmacists practicing in this setting will be helping to chart the course of the profession\u2019s future.Ms. Sax is a freelance writer based in Chevy Chase, Maryland.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "national retail chains,Rite Aid,CVS,Walgreens,American Academy of Family Physicians,Pew Research Center,chain pharmacy,pharmacy chains", "description": "National retail chains are positioning themselves to be on the front lines of patient care, creating a wide variety of career opportunities for rising pharmacists."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbd8c\"", "article_summary": "Chain Drugstores: On the Front Lines of Care and ChangeBarbara Sax and Aimee Simone, Assistant EditorIn the changing health care landscape, community pharmacists are expected to interact with even more patients, taking a larger role in primary care.\nting and collaborate with other health care professionals of the hospital,\u201d said Carter.\nWith an increasing number of Americans seeking primary care in an overburdened health care system\u2014as the population continues to age and more patients are granted access to health care services through the Affordable Care Act\u2014national retail chains of pharmacy, such as Rite Aid, CVS, and Walgreens, are positioning themselves to be on the front lines of patient care.\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous opportunity to be at the forefront of change in community pharmacy,\u201d said Al Carter, PharmD, pharmacy affairs manager at Walgreens.\n\u201cWhether in retail pharmacy, mail service pharmacy, specialty pharmacy or management positions, our colleagues are exposed to the many aspects of pharmacy care,\u201d she said.Belsey said that opportunities at Rite Aid can include positions in government affairs, managed care, business, legal, technology, the operations team, college relations, and recruitment.\u201cOur company\u2019s driven by pharmacy.\n\u201cI think we really look for someone who comes in with the mindset that the practice is continually evolving and who is willing to constantly change, move forward, and to embrace that change."}
