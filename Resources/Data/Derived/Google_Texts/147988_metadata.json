Claiborne Ave.\n\nThe $3 million project would restore a three-lane configuration for lakebound traffic at the Interstate 10-Claiborne Avenue junction near the Mercedes-Benz Superdome. In addition, ramp meters -- essentially traffic signals that alternate telling groups of motorists to wait before merging or proceed -- are to be erected at entrance ramps to the expressway.\n\nThe cost would be shared between the Department of Transportation and Development and the Regional Planning Commission. An accompanying $1 million restriping project for the three-lane traffic pattern at Claiborne qualifies for federal funding to address a safety issue, officials have said.\n\nEngineering and design have been underway for more than a year. Bids for the work are expected to be sought in September.\n\nAfternoon rush hour commuters have complained about the lakebound bottleneck since late 2010, when the transportation department restriped the expressway near the Superdome to reduce the number of wrecks. One of three lanes for westbound I-10 traffic was eliminated and lanes were designated for I-10 east and Claiborne Avenue.\n\nThat meant traffic crossing the Crescent City Connection to the east bank had to jockey with drivers merging onto the Pontchartrain Expressway from the Annunciation Street upramps at the O'Keefe and Earhart-Claiborne exits.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "crescent city connection, dotd, homepage, jefferson, jefferson traffic, new orleans, new orleans traffic, news, regional planning commission, traffic, west bank", "title": "How to ease Pontchartrain Expressway traffic congestion?
