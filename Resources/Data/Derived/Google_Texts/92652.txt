All we know is … it’s times like this that make us know gonna miss this guy.

We’re of course talking about Mr. President … Barack Obama!

If you missed it, the prez visited “Ellen” the other day and since this is Valentine’s Day weekend, he found time to wish his lovely wife and FLOTUS, Michelle Obama, a Happy Valentine’s Day … with the help of the maestro of love, Barry White playing in the background.

Here’s what he said:

“Michelle, this Valentine’s Day I’m going to treat you right,” Obama says. “I’m going to make you some zucchini bread and then spread out some veggies on a plate, just the way you like it.”

Then he added this gem of a pun:

“I love you so much. I Obamacare about you more than you even know. That’s right. Obama cares. But, Michelle, I’ve made a lot of great decisions as president. The best decision I ever made was choosing you.”

However, before the prez did his thing, Ellen set the moment by surprising him with a special Valentine’s greeting from Michelle who dropped this:

“Roses are red, violets are blue, you are the president, and I am your boo… Barack, I know there’s a See’s Candy out there so bring me something chocolatey back. You know what to do.”

OK, we take back what we said about missing Barack Obama when he’s leaves the White House. That’s because we’re gonna miss Barack AND Michelle Obama when they leave 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.

Check the hilarity and the love below on “Ellen”:
