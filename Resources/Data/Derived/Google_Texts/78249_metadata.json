In 2008, senior researcher Thomas J. Moore of the Institute for Safe Medical Practice concluded that the drug was associated with more adverse effects than any other medication on the market. A concomitant health advisory released in May 2008 eventually prompted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to ban the drug among pilots and air traffic controllers.\n\n\u201cThere were side effects that made it look like it was unsafe for pilots and people in critical occupations because there were seizures, blackouts, temporary blindness, blurry vision,\u201d Moore said, speaking to Al Jazeera America. He also cited an alarming number of \u201cinexplicable and unprovoked\u201d episodes of violence associated with the drug. \u201cThese cases had three striking characteristics,\u201d Moore said, referring to reports received by the FDA. \u201cFirst, the violence was absolutely unpredictable and senseless. Second, the victim was anybody who happened to be nearby. It could have been a fianc\u00e9. It could have been a mother. It could have been a police officer. And third, these people had no history of violence and were unlikely prospects for a violent act.\u201d\n\nThat said, FDA has so far been reluctant to indicate a distinct causal relationship between adverse psychiatric events and Chantix, which is distributed in the U.S. by Pfizer Inc. In a safety review released last year, the agency noted that while reports of alarming side-effects have been filed regularly, it is exceedingly difficult to determine whether these actually resulted from Chantix use. The review cited two independent studies that both failed to establish a heightened risk of neuropsychiatric hospitalization among users. \u201cHowever, both studies had a number of study design limitations, including only assessing neuropsychiatric events that resulted in hospitalization, and not having a large enough sample size to detect rare adverse events,\u201d agency officials noted.\n\nStudy limitations notwithstanding, the FDA concluded that the benefit-risk profile of Chantix was unchanged, and recommended that the drug remain on the market under its current \u201cblack-box warning\u201d \u2013 the most serious health warning the agency issues. Some would argue that the health warning, which lists as side-effects most adverse events reported to the agency, is an adequate precautionary measure that informs patients and physicians about the drug\u2019s psychiatric influence. Others assert that it is unrealistic to believe that formal warnings will curb the incidence of suicides.\n\n\u201cThe use of a black box warning is to help physicians identify early symptoms that so that you can prevent the adverse event from occurring,\u201d Michael Siegel, a professor at Boston University\u2019 School of Public Health, told reporters. \u201cIn the case of Chantix, the black box warning is basically telling physicians, \u2018Be careful because your patients might die taking this.\u2019 What use is it to monitor patients for suicide? Once they commit suicide, it\u2019s over.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "anti-smoking drug chantix suicides, psychiatric events, fda, pfizer, black box warning", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The anti-smoking drug Chantix has been implicated in 544 suicides and 1,869 attempted suicides, according to a review of FDA documents.", "title": "Anti-Smoking Drug Chantix Linked To Over 500 Suicides", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/anti-smoking-drug-chantix-linked-over-500-suicides-should-it-retain-its-fda-approval-263699", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/25/pills.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The anti-smoking drug Chantix has been implicated in 544 suicides and 1,869 attempted suicides, according to a review of FDA documents.", "title": "Anti-Smoking Drug Chantix Linked To Over 500 Suicides", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/anti-smoking-drug-chantix-linked-over-500-suicides-should-it-retain-its-fda-approval-263699", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/25/pills.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/25/pills.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2013-11-25T17:50:28-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-25T19:26:24-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The anti-smoking drug Chantix has been implicated in 544 suicides and 1,869 attempted suicides, according to a review of FDA documents."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf9ec\"", "article_summary": "In the past five years, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has received reports implicating the smoking cessation drug Chantix in 544 suicides and 1,869 attempted suicides, according to documents obtained by Al Jazeera America.\n\u201cHowever, both studies had a number of study design limitations, including only assessing neuropsychiatric events that resulted in hospitalization, and not having a large enough sample size to detect rare adverse events,\u201d agency officials noted.\nSince its introduction to the U.S. market in 2006, Chantix has been linked to an array of adverse psychiatric events, including suicidal behavior, depression, psychosis, and aggression.\nHe also cited an alarming number of \u201cinexplicable and unprovoked\u201d episodes of violence associated with the drug.\nStudy limitations notwithstanding, the FDA concluded that the benefit-risk profile of Chantix was unchanged, and recommended that the drug remain on the market under its current \u201cblack-box warning\u201d \u2013 the most serious health warning the agency issues."}
