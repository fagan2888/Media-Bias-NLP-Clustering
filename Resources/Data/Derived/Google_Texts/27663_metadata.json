May 20, 2016: I attended a well done FREE breakfast today compliments of one of Obama\u2019s America regular media \u201cpartners,\u201d The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe unexpected result is this week\u2019s episode. Anyway amid the tasty breakfast vittles, the guest speaker interviewed by WSJ editor Dennis Berman, was the CEO of oil giant Chevron, John Watson.\n\nWatson went through the usual CEO song and dance about what a wonderful corporation Chevron is. The audience, made up mostly of corporate zombies, was enthralled by his BS. Then Watson made a crucial error; he began talking about morality. That is when this episode was born.\n\nI then laid in wait at my table for the Q & A \u2013 and even better \u2013 I got to ask the Final Question of the WSJ breakfast.\n\n\u201cMr. Watson, you mentioned morality in your comments. Saudi Arabia, aka the Saud Family Estate, is one of the most repressive regimes on Earth, and with a primitive justice system, no real elections, and they support an extreme form of Islam linked to the rise of terrorism in the Middle East, other than North Korea I assume. Does Chevron have a list of countries it will not do business with because they do not meet basic moral standards?\n\nPoor Mr. Watson \u2013 his answer was unimpressive in the extreme as he looked right at me as CEOs tend to do and he seemed quite satisfied with himself.\n\nSORRY Watson wrong answer.\n\nMr. Watson\u2019s reply was very unsatisfying. The best he could do is say even the United States has its flaws. So he was saying since no nation is perfect, Chevron won\u2019t judge any nation? Where is his benchmark or his Moral Compass? He has none. And he had no list of countries to offer. Of course!\n\nI fault myself for not being even more specific and asking him which countries if any currently or in the past has Chevron refused to do business with or in because they do not meet your moral standard.\u201d There are none.\n\nSo let me tell you what he was saying \u2013 he and Chevron have NO moral compass; they will do business anywhere with anyone IF it is good for Chevron to profit from it. Money is the name of \u201cmorality\u201d at Chevron.\n\nHis \u201cmoral compass\u201d (sic) is profit pure and simple. If it is good for business it is good for him and Chevron. Their \u201clogic\u201d since even the U.S. is imperfect they will deal with any imperfect country no matter how imperfect. Just as long as no law prevents them from doing so.\n\nOK, John Watson be gone from my episode; you have served your purpose and I hope we will never see you again in Obama\u2019s America \u2026 but who knows.\n\nNow let\u2019s turn to the real subject of OBAMA\u2019S America yes the man himself Barack Obama and his \u201cmorality.\u201d Or lack thereof! Anyone wondering to Obama\u2019s America for the first time might be SHOCKED that I would be contenting President Barack Obama is immoral or un-moral.\n\nAll my regular readers know the Truth I do that all the time and prove it. Barack Obama is not the President too many believe he is, NO not from the whacky Racist perspective of the Right Wing I attack Obama from the Progressive Left where his true failure is to be found.\n\nI said I was done with Chevron\u2019s John Watson but John come back here one more time. Here is one easy way of making my point about Obama in this episode. If Barack Obama was CEO of Chevron he would sound much like John Watson. How do I know for sure? Because like John Watson President Obama does business with the Sauds far more business than Chevron does.\n\nWho cares if Obama is currently displaying some skepticism toward the Saud Family Estate or that the Saud are not feeling Obama\u2019s love? You will find Obama going to Saudi Arabia far more than John Chambers to reassure them of America\u2019s \u201cfriendship\u201d and Chambers does not sell the Saud Family BILLIONS of dollars worth of advance military equipment.\n\nUnfortunately I can\u2019t dwell on this my Publisher is breathing down my back to deliver this episode and I can feel the chill of her lovely breath. So let\u2019s move on to Obamacare another prime example of Obama immorality selling us this BS as REAL medical care reform.\n\nYes I cover this Obamacare scam regularly but there is always new material to prove the point that this is Obamacare for the medical industry. Leading the way this time SURPRISE is this article from my other major media partner the New York Times. This article from May 14, 2016, titled \u2026\n\n\u201c SORRY WE DON\u2019T TAKE OBAMACARE \u201d \u2026 what\u2019s that title again ..\n\n\u201c SORRY WE DON\u2019T TAKE OBAMACARE \u201d really !! Let\u2019s dig in \u2026\n\n\u201cAMY MOSES and her circle of self-employed small-business owners were supporters of President Obama and the Affordable Care Act. They bought policies on the newly created New York State exchange. But when they called doctors and hospitals in Manhattan to schedule appointments, they were dismayed to be turned away again and again with a common refrain: \u201cWe don\u2019t take Obamacare,\u201d the umbrella epithet for the hundreds of plans offered through the president\u2019s signature health legislation.\u201d REALLY!\n\nThen this \u2026 \u201cAnytime one of us needs a doctor,\u201d she continued, \u201cwe send out an alert: \u2018Does anyone have anyone on an exchange plan that does mammography or colonoscopy? Who takes our insurance?\u2019 It\u2019s really a problem.\u201d REALLY!\n\nAnd this \u2026 \u201cYet even as many beneficiaries acknowledge that they might not have insurance today without the law, there remains a strong undercurrent of discontent. Though their insurance cards look the same as everyone else\u2019s \u2014 with names like Liberty and Freedom from insurers like Anthem or United Health \u2014 the plans are often very different from those provided to most Americans by their employers. Many say they feel as if they have become second-class patients.\u201d REALLY!\n\nObamacare forces Americans to pay for CRAP \u201cinsurance.\u201d GREAT Obama can proclaim more Americans are insured YES with policies that SUCK. That they are FORCED to buy or else get PENALIZED by law.\n\nThere is so much more bad stuff in this article but I don\u2019t have the Time this week to fully explore. You can go read all of it please do. Back at WSJ here is a front page story from May 16th \u2026 \u201c\u201dHealth Insurers Quit Rural Exchanges\u201d sorry you will have to read it yourself NO time this week.\n\nFinally from Crain\u2019s NY today yes I am here in New York City. From Crain\u2019s comes this story\u2026\n\n\u201cNew York Obamacare insurers ask for big rate hikes.\u201d SURPRISE!\n\nHere is part of their article get very mad at Obama \u2026\n\n\u201cNew York insurers asked for large premium increases as a way to counteract rising costs, and in some cases, gargantuan losses. Insurers selling plans to individuals requested a 17.3% average increase and those selling small-group plans asked for an average 12% rate hike.\n\n\u201cThe state insurance marketplace, known as New York State of Health, has seemed to be more stable than other markets nationally, but insurers here haven\u2019t been immune to national trends that are driving up health care spending and increasing the costs of providing health insurance.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a statement Wednesday afternoon, the New York Health Plan Association said the hikes are necessary. \u201cThe 2017 rate submissions reflect increases that are the direct result of the underlying cost of care and marketplace changes that continue to impact health plans\u2019 operations,\u201d Paul Macielak, HPA\u2019s president and chief executive, said in a statement.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeveral notable insurers requested large increases for 2017. UnitedHealthcare, which has pulled out of insurance marketplaces in many other states, asked for a 45.6% increase to premiums.\n\n\u201c Oscar, the venture-capital darling that recently raised $400 million in a financing round from Fidelity, asked for an 18.4% average increase. In a letter to insurance brokers, the Manhattan company said its rate hikes ranged from 8% to 30% around the state.\u201d\n\n\u201cCareConnect, the insurance arm of Northwell Health, requested a 29.2% increase on average while MetroPlus, the health plan of NYC Health + Hospitals, sought a 20.3% average increase.\u201d\n\nThat is all I have time for go read it yourself.\n\nAnd these increases are going to come year after year without end. The Obamacare SCAM is a Gold Mine for the insurance and medical industries. And when Americans can\u2019t pay NO problem the gov\u2019t pays the rest of these second rate often WORTHLESS policies. WHERE is the morality Obama?\n\nI can\u2019t cover this vast subject of Obama\u2019s immorality as President in any one episode less one that has to be rushed and shortened but I must turn to President Obama\u2019s incestuous relationship to Hillary Clinton before I must end this episode. Talk about IMMORALITY! Obama is doing everything he can to insure Clinton\u2019s nomination without officially endorsing her. And by doing so doing everything he can to undermine Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign.\n\nSo we have the IMMORAL Democratic President partnering with the IMMORAL Democratic candidate for President to SCREW the rest of us out of a very REAL and MORAL Democratic candidate for President.\n\nSorry I really must go.
