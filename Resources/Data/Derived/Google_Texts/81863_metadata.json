Lamar Alexander (left) and Sen. Bob Corker.</p>\n\nBy Michael Collins of the Knoxville News Sentinel\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 U.S. Sen. Bob Corker has golfed with President Barack Obama, dined with him at a fancy restaurant and called him possibly the worst president in modern history.\n\nU.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander has broken bread with the president at the White House, squabbled with him on national television about health care, accused him of Nixonian tendencies and blasted him for acting like a king.\n\nThe two Tennessee Republicans\u2019 sometimes-amiable, sometimes-argumentative relationship with Obama and his administration has at times read like a Facebook relationship status. It\u2019s complicated \u2014 and about to get even more complicated when the senators become chairmen of two high-profile committees in the new GOP-led Congress.\n\nThough committee chairmen won\u2019t be formally appointed until January, Corker is expected to head the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a position that will make him a key player in the oversight of Obama policies on everything from Syria to Iran to the recently announced plan to restore U.S. relations with Cuba.\n\nAlexander is in line to chair the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, putting him at the center of GOP efforts to undo the Affordable Care Act, reauthorize the Bush-era No Child Left Behind school-reform law and other potentially controversial issues.\n\nThe new roles will require the senators to work more closely with Obama\u2019s aides and cabinet secretaries \u2014 and possibly Obama himself \u2014 further testing a relationship that both sides say must include frank talk and mutual respect, the essential elements of policymaking in Washington.\n\n\u201cPart of being here is discussing our differences, but also trying to move the country ahead through seeking common ground,\u201d Corker said.\n\nTwo hours after Corker declared on Fox News in November that Obama is on course to be one of the worst presidents ever, the White House called \u2014 not to complain, but to discuss another issue, Corker said. Obama himself sometimes phones from Air Force One when he has something important to discuss.\n\n\u201cI deal with people throughout the administration every single day,\u201d Corker said. \u201cI\u2019d say the relationship is one of understanding that while there are differences, the constant purpose of our interactions should be seeking solutions.\u201d\n\nAlexander describes his relationship with Obama as \u201ccordial, courteous, proper and infrequent.\u201d\n\nAt a recent bill signing at the White House, Obama singled out Alexander and Sen. Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat who currently chairs the HELP committee, for their work on child-care and block-grant legislation and praised them as lawmakers who know how to get things done. Obama also got involved during negotiations on student loan debt in 2013 and was good at helping Democrats and Republicans reach a deal that cut nearly in half the interest rate paid by all undergraduates, Alexander said.\n\nBut Alexander said his dealings with the White House have often been frustrating.\n\n\u201cThe problem with the White House is they seem to have no capacity for crafting a consensus, for making a deal,\u201d Alexander said, arguing the administration should be digging deep into issues with congressional Republicans and Democrats and then helping them forge an agreement.\n\n\u201cI spent most of my last six years wondering if they don\u2019t know how,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cThere has never been a clumsier White House in dealing with members of the Senate, whether Democrats or Republicans.\u201d\n\nBoth senators say they have a better working relationship with members of Obama\u2019s cabinet. But those conversations, too, can turn testy as the two sides air their policy disagreements.\n\n\u201cI had a conversation yesterday with (Secretary of State) John Kerry that was pretty intense,\u201d Corker said in early December. \u201cI had a conversation yesterday with (Treasury Secretary) Jack Lew that was pretty intense. But the purpose of those conversations is to move us to a place where the legislative body and the executive branch can work in unison to move our nation ahead.\u201d\n\nWhether he\u2019s talking with Kerry or Lew or Obama himself, Corker said he always says exactly what he thinks\u2014something he thinks the administration has come to respect.\n\n\u201cI have conversations that point out (policy) weaknesses directly with the president,\u201d Corker said, citing Obama\u2019s recent executive actions on immigration reform as an example. \u201cWe\u2019ve had sitting-three-feet-from-each-other discussions about my concerns about foreign policy.\u201d\n\nKerry, who chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee before becoming secretary of state, said he appreciates Corker\u2019s candor.\n\n\u201cI like that he\u2019s blunt,\u201d Kerry said in a statement. \u201cHe tells me when he thinks we can do better, and he keeps our conversations confidential. He doesn\u2019t blow smoke, and he delivers. His word is stronger than oak. I think he can be a really consequential chairman, and I\u2019ll tell you, that is a committee that can really matter and do a huge service to the Senate and the country. And knowing Bob, I think that\u2019s what he\u2019ll provide.\u201d\n\nAlexander also said Obama has strong cabinet members, particularly Education Secretary Arne Duncan, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz and Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell.\n\nAlexander, who served as education secretary under President George H.W. Bush, has been critical of Duncan at times, arguing he often acts like the chairman of a national school board by granting states waivers from No Child Left Behind and then requiring them to meet other federal demands.\n\nStill, Alexander said, Duncan is a good education secretary.\n\n\u201cHe cares about children,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cHe stays in touch. He\u2019s easy to work with.\u201d\n\nDuncan, likewise, offers praise for Alexander.\n\n\u201cSecretary Duncan has great respect for Senator Alexander, and while he may not always agree with him on policy, he looks forward to continuing to work with Senator Alexander to ensure educational opportunity for all students,\u201d said Dorie Nolt, a spokeswoman for the Education Department.\n\nAlexander and Corker say their past disagreements with the administration shouldn\u2019t \u2014 and won\u2019t \u2014 impede their ability to work together on important issues when they become chairmen of their respective committees.\n\n\u201cEvery day when I wake up, it\u2019s a new day, and I\u2019m moving ahead trying to solve problems,\u201d Corker said.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Senators' relationship with Obama administration \u00e2\u0080\u0098complicated'", "og": {"url": "http://www.knoxnews.com/news/senators-relationship-with-obama-administration-complicated-ep-843148510-353735811.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/corker_alexander_1419592170852_11796732_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 473}, "type": "article", "description": "U.S. Sens.
