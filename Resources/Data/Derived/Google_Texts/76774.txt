On Monday, DeRenda Warren joined The Chad Hasty Show to talk about her entry into the race to represent District 19 in the U.S. House of Representatives.

Warren is a former Lady Raider basketball player, has an extensive medical background and was raised in agriculture.

Warren and Hasty discussed many issues including agriculture, Obamacare and border security. When asked by Hasty why she decided to jump into the District 19 race, Warren replied:

Really I had overwhelming … people calling and truly asking me, ‘Mrs. Warren, please look into this. We just feel like you’ve got what it’s gonna take to get this taken care of. And then, so as I’ve looked into it, and I’ve really put my heart into it, I see I’ve got to at least say that I am putting out that best fight going up there because, I realize my children and my grandchildren have a grave future in front of them and I just can’t sit back and see this happen.
