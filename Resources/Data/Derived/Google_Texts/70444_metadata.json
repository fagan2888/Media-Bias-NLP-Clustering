Bernie Sanders of Vermont speaks during a news conference at The Hope Project to discuss the \u201cEmploy Young Americans Now Act\u201d in Washington June 4, 2015. Reuters\n\nKEENE, N.H. \u2013 Two thoughts spring to mind after a day spent watching Sen. Bernie Sanders on the campaign trail. (Read that story here.)\n\nFirst: It isn\u2019t so clear he really believes he can be president.\n\nAnd second: He\u2019ll be a formidable presence on the Democratic debate stage nonetheless.\n\nA standing-room-only crowd of 800 sat in metal folding chairs and lined the walls of a local rec center Saturday to hear Mr. Sanders\u2019s dire take on American economic and political life. The country is veering from democracy toward oligarchy, he said. People are working harder than ever for a diminishing share of the country\u2019s wealth. Plutocrats abetted by conservative Supreme Court justices are flooding campaigns with money that can\u2019t be traced to the source.\n\nMissing from the speech were some of the softening notes that most conventional candidates see as obligatory. There weren\u2019t all that many riffs about American exceptionalism. If anything, Mr. Sanders seemed more enamored with the Scandanavian model of social Democratic governance, with its generous health-care and educational subsidies.\n\nMr. Sanders\u2019s supporters are loving it.\n\nAnnie Millar Desmond, a New Hampshire resident who came to hear Mr. Sanders, went with her husband afterward to a local coffee shop and raved about what she had heard.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve admired him since I was in high school,\u201d Ms. Desmond, 37 years old, said. \u201cHe always seemed like the impossible: a politician who doesn\u2019t seem like a politician.\u201d\n\nDeep into Mr. Sanders\u2019s hour-long speech was a line that offered a glimpse into what his presidential campaign might really be about.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to do in this campaign is raise issues that very few people talk about and are not going to see on TV or in the newspapers,\u201d he said.\n\nSo, is he trying to become president, or raise important issues?\n\nOdds don\u2019t favor Mr. Sanders. Hillary Clinton is running nearly 50 points ahead of him in the polls. In 2008, then-Sen. Barack Obama took on Mrs. Clinton and had no qualms about attacking her credentials and record. Mr. Sanders is far more circumspect. He didn\u2019t mention Mrs. Clinton once in his speech or in the question-and-answer session that followed. Only when a reporter asked about him later about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s policies on trade did he offer a gentle rebuke, saying she should make her feelings known.\n\nOne reason? Mr. Sanders might have no wish to see her weakened in the event she squares off against the Republicans in the general election.\n\nBut Mr. Sanders could do some damage to her campaign, nonetheless.\n\nMr. Sanders is a compelling speaker. He lays out clear positions, delivering them with conviction and energy. Mrs. Clinton is a cautious campaigner who has yet to unspool many of her policy positions. Should she waffle when it comes to controversial issues like free trade, she could look calculating and tepid in comparison to Mr. Sanders. Is that enough to deprive her of the Democratic nomination? Doubtful. But a strong debate performance by Mr. Sanders would only feed the Bernie Boomlet that has been playing out in Iowa and New Hampshire in recent weeks.\n\nDavid Axelrod, a lead strategist in Mr. Obama\u2019s winning presidential campaigns, said he doesn\u2019t believe Mr. Sanders will win the party nomination. But, he added: \u201cHe plainly is not in the practice of curbing his enthusiasms.\u201d\n\nVoters, Mr. Axelrod said, \u201cappreciate someone who has a point of view and goes out and fights for it.\u201d\n\nRELATED:\n\nMeet the Candidate: Bernie Sanders\n\nClinton to Address Social, Economic Policy in Speeches", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Is Sen.
