The UK isn\u2019t far behind, though, with the number of obese nearly matching the U.S. While it\u2019s predicted that the UK population will become more obese or overweight in the next 15 years, a new study shows its average BMI has been growing for the past 20 years, especially in those who were already obese.\n\nResearchers from the University of Liverpool\u2019s Department of Geography used data from the Health Survey England, which looks at yearly changes in health and lifestyle among people throughout the UK, to study BMI trends across social groups from 1992 to 2013. They found the average BMI level of the population steadily increased over 11 years, with the 95th percentile of people (those who were heaviest) experiencing the largest increase in BMI.\n\nBMI is a calculation that uses a person\u2019s height and weight to gauge a their body fat. It divides people into four categories; underweight (less than 18.5); normal weight (18.5 to 24.9); overweight (25 to 29.9); and obese (30 and over).\n\nOver 20 years, the average BMI levels of more than 10,418 participants rose by nearly a whole point in both men and women. Looking deeper, the researchers found those who were uneducated had an average point-and-a-half higher BMI than those who had achieved a higher education.\n\nMore importantly, the study showed that BMI increased throughout the 1990s, but began to taper in men and women by 2001. This slowing did not occur among those in the 95th percentile. Rather, their BMI increased for the next 12 years, with the less educated experiencing the largest increases. Conversely, those within the 5th percentile (with the lowest BMIs) showed little change over 20 years, regardless of education.\n\nThe 5 percent of participants with the highest BMI are most at risk for health problems, the researchers said. They cited a 2013 study that found the higher a person\u2019s BMI, the greater their chances of mortality by all causes. \u201cIf this pattern continues to rise following current trends, then we may expect increased prevalence of ill health associated with excess body weight,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe slowing down of median BMI hailed by some public health officials may not be quite the success it first appeared.\u201d\n\nWhile the results may appear concerning, there\u2019s a growing body of research that suggests BMI isn\u2019t the most perfect way to measure body fat and overall health. For example, it doesn\u2019t account for where in the person\u2019s body the fat is located (an important distinction), or the higher weight of muscle. For this reason, a recent study found many Americans can be mislabeled as obese, while normal weight people might actually be the ones who are unhealthy.\n\nSource: Green M, Subramanian S, Razak F.
