JEB BUSH: \u201cPeople are tired of the negativity. They want to be inspired again. As a party we can\u2019t be successful just by being a little less like Democrats. I mean we have to offer a compelling alternative. \u2026 I don\u2019t know if you all agree with this but I remember the days when Republican candidates were the optimists.\u2026We need to get back to that.\u201d\n\n\u2026 ON BENGHAZI\n\nPresident & CEO of the Long Island Association Kevin Law asks Jeb Bush: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \u201ctestified before Congress on the tragedy in Benghazi and said, \u2018It doesn\u2019t really matter what actually happened.\u2019 Do you think it does matter?\u201d\n\nBUSH: \u201cOf course it matters. We need to learn from the experiences. We need to learn from the mistakes that were made. Of course it matters. Four Americans lost their lives. It matters. It matters a lot. Sometimes one of the hard things to do in politics today is to admit you made a mistake. It just seems almost impossible. I think in this case the country would have been better off, the Obama administration would be better off if they just admitted that there was a mistake in some fashion rather than try to say `here is a shiny object go follow that.\u2019 You know there is this \u2013 I know they were trying to get past the election because of the political ramifications of this in an election year. But it matters a lot. Of course it does.\u201d\n\n\u2026 ON THE WEIGHT OF HIS LAST NAME\n\nBUSH: \"It's an issue for sure \u2026 I get the point. It's something that, if I run, I would have to overcome that. And so will Hillary, by the way. Let's keep the same standards for everybody.\"\n\nICYMI: CNN\u2019s John King on his show \u201cInside Politics\u201d Sunday reported that Jeb Bush has been speaking to GOP fundraisers and is starting to ask questions about a potential 2016 race.\n\nAND WHILE WE ARE AT IT, MAKE WAY FOR BOBBY JINDAL \u2026\n\nGov. Bobby Jindal, R- Louisiana, slammed the Obama administration for \u201csurrendering\u201d the economy: \u201cI think there are things we can do instead of waving the white flag of surrender, instead of declaring this economy to be a minimum wage economy \u2026 I think our economy, I think America, can do better.\u201d\n\nON THE DEMOCRATIC FRONT \u2026 CLINTON FORCES TRY TO TAP OBAMA MAGIC IN SOUTH CAROLINA \u2026 CNN\u2019s Peter Hamby reports: \u201cLike all of the early caucus primary states that will help determine the Democratic nominee in 2016, South Carolina is no sure bet for Clinton if she decides to run. Polls show her with a wide lead over hypothetical opponents, but surveys also suggest the base of her party is drifting leftward, away from the centrism that defines Clintonian politics. \u2026 What might damage Clinton, a range of South Carolina Democrats said, would be the sudden emergence of another African-American candidate in a primary where the percentage of black voters could be as high as 60%.\u201d\n\nAmong the nuggets in Hamby\u2019s piece:\n\n-Biden supporter calls pro-Hillary group 'a cult'\n\n-Bill Clinton still making phone calls into the state\n\nLONGEST-SERVING HOUSE MEMBER TO RETIRE AFTER 58 YEARS \u2026 John Dingell, the longest serving member of Congress in U.S. history, will announce Monday that he'll retire at the end of the year rather than run for re-election. The 87-year-old Democratic congressman from Michigan, known as the House \u2018dean,\u2019 told the Detroit News that \"I'm not going to be carried out feet first,\" adding that \"I don't want people to say I stayed too long. This is not the Congress I know and love \u2026 It\u2019s hard for me to accept, but it\u2019s time to cash it in.\u201d\n\nGut Check Full Service: No one but a Dingell has ever held Michigan\u2019s 12th district congressional seat. The seat was created in 1932, and was filled the following year by Dingell\u2019s father, John Dingell Sr., until he died in 1955. Upon his father\u2019s passing, John Dingell Jr. ran for his father\u2019s seat in a special election and won a full term the following year in 1956. John Dingell Jr. has been reelected 29 times since. And the streak has a possibility of continuing \u2026 according to Detroit News, Dingell\u2019s wife Debbie Dingell is expected to run for her husband\u2019s seat upon his retirement.\n\nTHE BUZZ: SENATE CANDIDATE REGRETS GRUESOME X-RAY POSTINGS\n\nMilton Wolf, a radiologist and GOP primary challenger against Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas, issued a statement Sunday admitting he made \"insensitive\" comments about X-ray images he posted online, including an image of a person decapitated by gunfire. \"Several years ago, I made some comments about these images that were insensitive to the seriousness of what the images revealed. Soon thereafter, I removed those images and comments, again several years ago,\" he said in a statement. \u2013 Ashley Killough\n\nIn a video interview with Tim Carpenter of the Topeka Capital-Journal on Monday, Wolf defended his Facebook posts, and his ability to release medical images from patients saying, \u201cIf you don\u2019t identify a person, you don\u2019t need their permission.\u201d\n\nMARKET WATCH: S&P 500 finishes just shy of record close as investors cheer good global economic news.

He also has defended the auto industry by defeating or tempering air pollution and safety rules that he said excessively raised costs. Dingell has served in the House for more than 21,000 days because, as he said last year, \u201cI\u2019ve always had things to do.\u201d \u2013 Marisa Shcultz\n\nLeading Drudge: Games Over!\n\nFor more than two weeks while Russia hosted the Winter Olympics, President Vladimir Putin did his best to show the world that he and his country have a soft side. Now the Sochi Games are over, Western governments are concerned the smile will disappear and the gloves come off in Russia's tug-of-war with Europe over the fate of Ukraine. \u2013 Timothy Heritage\n\nLeading HuffPo: \u2018Corrupt Bandit\u2019\n\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro did not take kindly to sharp criticism from Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) over violent demonstrations between anti-government protesters and security forces in the western state of Tachira. Maduro attacked Rubio as \"el loco de los locos,\" which translates to \"the craziest of the crazies,\" in a video posted to YouTube Sunday and first reported by the Daily Caller. Maduro said Rubio was a \"corrupt bandit linked to Posada Carriles,\" referring to Luis Posada Carriles, the former CIA operative who is viewed as a terrorist by the Cuban and Venezuelan governments. \u2013 Sabrina Siddiqui\n\nLeading Politico: The Democrats' would-be Karl Rove\n\nJim Messina, the former campaign manager to President Barack Obama who spent two decades in politics out of the public eye, is increasingly stepping out from the shadows \u2014 and onto other Democrats\u2019 toes. \u2013 Kenneth Vogel and Maggie Haberman\n\nLeading Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel: Scott Walker urged county staff, campaign aides to promote him online\n\nIn the heat of the 2010 governor's race, Scott Walker urged both county employees and campaign aides to go to news websites and post comments promoting him and his record, newly unsealed documents show. \u2013 Jason Stein, Patrick Marley and Daniel Bice\n\nLeading New York Times: Stability and Chaos, Hallmarks of Presidential Races, Swap Parties\n\nAs the early positioning for the 2016 presidential primaries gets underway, the two parties appear to be swapping their usual roles. With former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s widely presumed candidacy overwhelming the Democratic field and dominating the news media\u2019s attention, Democrats are playing the part of the royalists seeking a smooth succession. At the same time, the Republicans are acting like the Democrats of yore, anticipating a free-for-all primary that highlights the competing and at times fractious constituencies in their coalition. \u2013 Jonathan Martin\n\nHOT SOTS\n\nThe political bites of the day\n\n- DNC leader: We\u2019ll pick up seats in 2014\u2013\n\nDEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRWOMAN DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, D-FLORIDA, TO CNN\u2019S KATE BOLDUAN ON \u201cNEW DAY\u201d: \"I think we have tremendous opportunities across the country.

It could change. I commented that this was based on what we knew on that morning, was provided to me and my colleagues and indeed to Congress by the intelligence community, and that\u2019s been well validated in many different ways since \u2026 That information turned out in some respects not to be 100 percent correct \u2026 But the notion that somehow I or anybody else in the administration is patently false, and that\u2019s been amply demonstrated.\u201d\n\n- Haley: Cutting military is not logical -\n\nGOV. NIKKI HALEY, R-SOUTH CAROLINA, AT THE RGA PRESS BRIEFING: \u201cWe have survived through this war and survived through all of this service in protecting this country through the National Guard \u2026 So you're going to go and now punish all these people who are asking for debt reduction by cutting the National Guard? It's just not a logical way to do things. So what we are seeing is heavy government.\u201d\n\nTOP TWEETS\n\nWhat stopped us in 140 characters or less\n\nShawn McCarthy (\u200f@smccarthy55)\n\nObama says sees Keystone decision in next couple months, countering those who say he'll punt past mid-terms. http://fw.to/Clc9ieO\n\nAshley Killough (\u200f@KilloughCNN)\n\nPerry: \"There is no defending not opening the XL pipeline..I don't know why he\u2019s going to wait two or three months\u201d (2/2)\n\nAriane de Vogue \u200f(@Arianedevogue)\n\n#Scotus will not take up two gun cases: Nra v.

Scott Walker is the only person in U.S. history to win a gubernatorial recall election.\n\nWalker won the 2012 recall election with 53% of the vote. The recall was prompted by his decision to cut collective bargaining rights for most public workers.\n\nPrior to the recall election in Wisconsin, only two other recall votes have occurred - North Dakota in 1921 and California in 2003. In both instances, the elected governors were unable to survive the vote and retain their seats in office.\n\nGUT CHECK WINNER\u2019S CIRCLE\n\n(why aren\u2019t you in it)\n\nCongrats to Steve Liguori (@SteveL3877) and Wade Payson-Denney (@TheRealWadePD) for correctly answering today\u2019s Gut Check Trivia question.\n\nGOT NEWS?\n\nTips or comments?
