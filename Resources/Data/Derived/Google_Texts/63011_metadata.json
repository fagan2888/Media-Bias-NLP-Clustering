He wasn\u2019t diagnosed until undergoing a scan Thursday after several days of what felt more like a stomachache than a serious injury.\n\nThe quarterback will not need surgery and is expected to fully recover, but Smith would miss a potential playoff game.\n\nIf the Chargers beat Kansas City, they clinch a postseason berth. The Chiefs would need to win and have Baltimore and Houston lose to make the playoffs.\n\nDaniel has one career start in six NFL seasons \u2014 which happened to come against the Chargers in last year\u2019s regular-season finale. With the Chiefs locked into the No. 5 seed, Smith rested that day. Daniel went 21 of 30 for 200 yards with a touchdown and no interceptions and rushed seven times for 59 yards in a 27-24 overtime loss that got San Diego into the playoffs.\n\nSmith didn\u2019t notice anything was amiss Sunday until after he\u2019d showered and the adrenaline wore off. Experiencing cramping and pressure, Smith visited the medical staff, but he didn\u2019t exhibit the telltale signs of a lacerated spleen.\n\n\u201cThought it was something I ate,\u201d he said, so he took some antacids.\n\nSmith practiced twice this week, feeling fine other than some nausea. A stomach virus had been going around the team, so everyone suspected it might be that.\n\nBy Thursday, though, he hadn\u2019t gotten any better.\n\n\u201cIt just didn\u2019t go away,\u201d he said.\n\nSmith didn\u2019t want to leave his family on Christmas, but a team doctor helped persuade him to undergo the scan, which found a 3-centimeter laceration. Smith had little bleeding, explaining why he had so few symptoms.\n\nIf Smith had taken a hard hit to the abdomen after the injury occurred, his spleen could have ruptured, causing dangerous bleeding.\n\nSmith believes he was hurt when he was hit by linebacker Jason Worilds after releasing an incomplete deep pass to Albert Wilson on the Chiefs\u2019 first drive of the second half Sunday. Team trainer Rick Burkholder said nothing about the play looked out of the ordinary live or when he later rewatched it on video.\n\nSmith was 15 of 23 for 125 yards after that, leading the Chiefs to two field goals.\n\nSmith has thrown for 18 touchdowns with six interceptions this season.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Alex Smith out for Kansas City Chiefs with lacerated spleen", "title": "Alex Smith out for Kansas City Chiefs with lacerated spleen", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/26/alex-smith-out-for-kansas-city-chiefs-with-lacerated-spleen/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141226__alex-smith-chiefs-qb-outp1.jpg", "height": 446}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141226__alex-smith-chiefs-qb-outp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-26T13:22:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T05:19:24+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce888\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith will miss Sunday\u2019s game against the San Diego Chargers because of a lacerated spleen, he said Friday.\nSmith didn\u2019t notice anything was amiss Sunday until after he\u2019d showered and the adrenaline wore off.\nExperiencing cramping and pressure, Smith visited the medical staff, but he didn\u2019t exhibit the telltale signs of a lacerated spleen.\nSmith was 15 of 23 for 125 yards after that, leading the Chiefs to two field goals.\nSmith didn\u2019t want to leave his family on Christmas, but a team doctor helped persuade him to undergo the scan, which found a 3-centimeter laceration."}
