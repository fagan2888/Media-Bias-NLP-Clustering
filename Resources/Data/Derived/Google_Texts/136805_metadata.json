Sports Illustrated writer Alexander Wolff, author of \u201cThe Audacity of Hoop: Basketball and the Age of Obama,\u201d explained exactly how the commander in chief was shaped by the sport from a young age in a talk on campus Monday.\n\n\u201cThis book grew out of an assignment I got from Sports Illustrated,\u201d Wolff began. \u201cBy the end of the 2008 campaign, it became clear that this man had always had basketball in his life in some way or another.\u201d\n\nWolff explained that basketball was a part of Obama\u2019s life from a very young age, as he played basketball in high school and played pickup games for years afterwards.\n\n\u201cIn Chicago, he put together a group of people that would be a part of his political career for years, and many of those people were basketball people\u2026Basketball is very much a part of what he does,\u201d Wolff said.\n\nFrom there, the would-be president went on to incorporate basketball into his campaign, including playing games of basketball with police and firefighters.\n\n\u201cIn 2008 we\u2019ve got the campaign going, and there are people who work on the campaign who know that he loves the game, but his chief political strategist, David Axelrod, is wary about having him too identified with basketball too quickly because of racial connotations, and he didn\u2019t want voters to learn about him first as a basketball player,\u201d Wolff explained.\n\n\u201cThere came a point where, in New Hampshire, that they had him playing casually with patrolmen and firefighters. By the spring of \u201908, the campaign moved to Indiana and North Carolina, both big basketball states, and they found time for him to have a scrimmage with the North Carolina varsity team in Chapel Hill.\u201d\n\nWolff also implied that basketball played a role in helping Obama win North Carolina and Indiana, two states that traditionally vote Republican.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any coincidence that the two reddest states that he flipped to blue were Indiana and North Carolina\u2026He said that I can converse with you in this local idiom,\u201d Wolff said. \u201cTry as they might, guys from the McCain campaign couldn\u2019t spin this as anything but a new guy with a magic touch.\u201d\n\nThe political influence that basketball had upon voters and supporters did not end when Obama entered office, however. Wolff explained the challenges that President Obama faced in getting people to sign up for the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare.\n\n\u201cSo Obamacare is passed, and Health and Human Services are trying to get people to sign up. The whole success of the law is hanging in the balance because they had to get young people to sign up to offset the old people who would sign up. Everyone in Washington said it was DOA and there was no way, so the President went to Magic Johnson and got him to do public service announcements. Guys like Lebron James used their social media to get people to sign up, and the threshold is met,\u201d Wolff said. \u201cI posit in the book that basketball helped save the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nThe approach of using basketball and sports to connect with people who typically didn\u2019t follow politics, Wolff said, was also used by other parts of the US government, such as the State department sending WNBA players overseas to talk to young women in developing countries.\n\n\u201cThe State department uses basketball, and especially women\u2019s basketball, sending WNBA players into developing countries to talk to women and young girls and get them to raise their sights a bit,\u201d Wolff said.\n\nObama\u2019s approach has also made basketball players more willing to get involved with current affairs, Wolff said, citing the example of NBA player Derrick Rose wearing an \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe\u201d shirt, bringing attention to the death of Eric Garner.\n\n\u201cThe age of Obama has served to politicize the NBA locker room. In the early 2000s, the attitude was just \u2018show me the money\u2019 and \u2018don\u2019t leave any sneaker sales on the table,\u2019\u201d Wolff said. \u201cThe Obama campaign politicized a lot of these players, and they jumped on the bandwagon so when there were real issues to be addressed, many of them wanted to step out. [University of Connecticut] alumnus Ray Allen, of whom you should be proud, said \u2018we make so much money, it\u2019s impossible not to have a foundation.\u2019 It\u2019s a little bit of that attitude that the Obama generation is creating.\u201d\n\nStudents enjoyed the lecture, commenting that it was a rare but interesting blend of sports, politics and journalism.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really follow basketball, but I thought it was interesting,\u201d Monica Khersonsky, a sixth semester economics major said.\n\nWhen one examines the timeline of Obama\u2019s life, Wolff argued, the evidence that basketball was one of the defining parts of his life is undeniable.\n\n\u201cIf you think about the journey of his life and the effect that basketball had on him, I think it\u2019s undeniable that it had a unifying effect on him,\u201d Wolff said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Daily Campus", "description": "Sports Illustrated writer Alexander Wolff, author of \u201cThe Audacity of Hoop: \r\nBasketball and the Age of Obama,\u201d explained exactly how the commander in \r\nchief was shaped by the sport from a young age in a talk on campus Monday.", "title": "Sports Illustrated writer explains how basketball shaped President Obama", "url": "http://dailycampus.com/stories/2016/3/22/sports-illustrated-writer-alex-wolff-explains-how-basketball-shaped-president-obama", "image": "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/54f74f23e4b0952b4e0011c0/54f9cb03e4b0d8458d5fcbc7/56f09c811d07c08174ae8824/1458659805010/29.JPG?format=1000w", "longitude": "-95.71289100000001", "latitude": "37.09024", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://dailycampus.com/stories/2016/3/22/sports-illustrated-writer-alex-wolff-explains-how-basketball-shaped-president-obama", "image": "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/54f74f23e4b0952b4e0011c0/54f9cb03e4b0d8458d5fcbc7/56f09c811d07c08174ae8824/1458659805010/29.JPG?format=1000w", "description": "Sports Illustrated writer Alexander Wolff, author of \u201cThe Audacity of Hoop: \r\nBasketball and the Age of Obama,\u201d explained exactly how the commander in \r\nchief was shaped by the sport from a young age in a talk on campus Monday.", "card": "summary", "title": "Sports Illustrated writer explains how basketball shaped President Obama"}, "description": "Sports Illustrated writer Alexander Wolff, author of \u201cThe Audacity of Hoop: \r\nBasketball and the Age of Obama,\u201d explained exactly how the commander in \r\nchief was shaped by the sport from a young age in a talk on campus Monday.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "From there, the would-be president went on to incorporate basketball into his campaign, including playing games of basketball with police and firefighters.\nWhen one examines the timeline of Obama\u2019s life, Wolff argued, the evidence that basketball was one of the defining parts of his life is undeniable.\nWolff explained the challenges that President Obama faced in getting people to sign up for the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare.\nBasketball has been a huge part of the lives of millions of people, but no one has been influenced by the sport quite like President Barack Obama.\nSports Illustrated writer Alexander Wolff, author of \u201cThe Audacity of Hoop: Basketball and the Age of Obama,\u201d explained exactly how the commander in chief was shaped by the sport from a young age in a talk on campus Monday."}
