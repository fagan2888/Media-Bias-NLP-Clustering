But administrators defended their initial decision and left open the chance that the policy could be put in place next year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll look at everything going forward. But one of the things we do know is that one employer \u2013 and there\u2019s many of them like us \u2013 cannot absorb the health care costs and responsibilities of a community,\u201d said Michael J. Moley, senior vice president and chief human resource officer for Catholic Health.\n\nWhile Catholic Health changed its mind, more companies are imposing limits on coverage of workers\u2019 spouses to hold down the price of employee health benefits.\n\nFirst Niagara Financial Group this year began excluding spouses who can get insurance elsewhere, and UPS generated headlines last year when it did the same with its white-collar workers.\n\nA survey by benefits consultant Towers Watson found that the share of large employers planning to exclude spouses is likely to double by 2015. Local insurance brokers say few companies here have taken that step because of concerns over how employees will react, but it\u2019s on their minds.\n\n\u201cIt is definitely in the conversation,\u201d said Kathleen O\u2019Connell Armstrong, employee benefits manager with the Evans Agency. \u201cOur clients are scraping with their nails on keeping benefits for their employees \u2013 however they can still offer them \u2013 but they\u2019re becoming so cost-prohibitive.\u201d\n\nThe price of company-provided insurance is rising, though more slowly than in the 1990s and early 2000s, and employers are hunting for new ways to trim costs. The average yearly premium for employer-sponsored family health benefits rose by 3 percent this year, to $16,834, according to the latest Employer Health Benefits Survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research & Educational Trust. That\u2019s in line with modest increases in recent years; workers pay about one-fourth of that bill.\n\nMany companies are trying to trim costs without affecting employees\u2019 basic benefits. While the Affordable Care Act requires coverage for full-time employees and dependents at large employers, it doesn\u2019t for spouses.\n\n\u201cI think that just brought it to light. \u2018OK, you don\u2019t have to offer it to spouses \u2013 that\u2019s what the government\u2019s telling me. Maybe I should look at this as a benefit plan design option,\u2019 \u201d said Brian Murphy, a partner with Lawley Benefits Group.\n\nGenerally, companies that have made this move only exclude spouses who are eligible for coverage through their own employers, and they continue to cover spouses who aren\u2019t working or who don\u2019t receive health benefits through their employer. Other companies allow spouses to remain on medical plans but charge them more to do so.\n\nThe move to exclude spouses, or charge them a higher rate, has accelerated in recent years.\n\nA survey from Towers Watson and the National Business Group on Health found that 23 percent of large employers \u2013 those with 1,000 or more workers \u2013 planned next year to limit benefits for spouses who can get coverage from their own companies, up from the 10 percent who did so this year. Next year, 39 percent of large employers plan to let spouses stay on their insurance but to levy a surcharge \u2013 averaging $100 per month \u2013 if they had access to coverage from their own employers. That\u2019s up from 24 percent this year.\n\n\u201cEmployers are getting a lot more aggressive, with spousal surcharges and spousal carve-outs, in that space now. And when big companies like UPS make news, I think we will start to see more adopters,\u201d Michael J. Gaal, an actuary and health benefits consultant with Milliman, said at a health care forum last week in Buffalo.\n\nFirst Niagara said in September 2013 that it was ending coverage for spouses and domestic partners who can get insurance through their own employers. Without that move, the increase in premiums for 2014 would have been more than the bank and its workers could absorb, First Niagara said in a memo obtained by The Buffalo News. The bank said that about 2,000 spouses and domestic partners were covered by its medical plans and estimated that up to half were eligible for coverage elsewhere. Of the 10,000 people covered by First Niagara\u2019s insurance plans, employees were outnumbered by spouses, partners and children.\n\n\u201cFirst Niagara is committed to providing our employees with benefits that are comprehensive and affordable, and the company continues to pay the majority of the cost for our employees\u2019 medical insurance,\u201d Kate White, managing director of human resources, said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nCatholic Health officials said they began discussing a spousal exclusion two years ago, after noticing an uptick in spouses coming onto their plans.\n\nMoley thinks the trend is driven by the attractiveness of the system\u2019s comprehensive coverage, at a time when many employers are offering plans with higher co-pays and deductibles. \u201cWhat we found is they were dropping the coverage from their employers and moving over to us,\u201d he said.\n\nThe number of spouses covered by Catholic Health\u2019s insurance increased by 22 percent over the last several years. The overall cost of employees\u2019 health insurance rose by $20 million in the last four years, with nearly $6 million of that due to spouses\u2019 health care, Moley said.\n\nCatholic Health calculated that about 700 workers\u2019 spouses would need to leave its insurance plan under the new policy; children could remain. Employees, who were told Sept. 30, balked at the policy, saying they didn\u2019t have enough time to plan and lamented the financial impact. Catholic Health officials said they were swayed by the workers\u2019 arguments and, in a memo dated Oct. 14, announced they were reversing their decision. \u201cIt certainly was an emotional feedback,\u201d Moley said.\n\nHowever, Catholic Health said that retaining the spouses would lead to a larger increase in premium costs for next year. Moley said that the costs of Catholic Health plans will increase by 8.75 percent for 2015 and that about half the increase is due to keeping spousal coverage.\n\nArea insurers and insurance brokers said that companies are reluctant to adopt spouse carve-out policies because benefits are part of an employee\u2019s compensation and that limiting them could make the company a less desirable place to work.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t had any, to date, actually do that, and I think part of it is because of morale,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cI also think that there\u2019s a way in which to deliver this message, and employers are hesitant. And yet if they\u2019re going to do it, they understand that they have to do it well, well, well in advance.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear how much money employers would save by excluding spouses. The Employee Benefit Research Institute predicted that the first companies to make the move would see savings but that as more companies drive spouses back to their own employers, the benefit to any one company would subside over time. The brokers also said some employers worry that limiting spousal coverage could hurt their reputation in the community.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of people that maybe, like Catholic Health System, wanted to dip their toes in the water,\u201d Murphy said, \u201cbut we\u2019re not seeing a bunch of groups jumping in and say let\u2019s do this.\u201d\n\nemail: swatson@buffnews.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Catholic Health System last month informed its workers that it would no longer provide health insurance to their spouses who could obtain coverage through their own employers, citing the rising cost and a growing number of spouses added to its medical plans.The hospital system reversed cou...", "og": {"site_name": "www.buffaloNews.com", "description": "Catholic Health System last month informed its workers that it would no longer provide health insurance to their spouses who could obtain coverage through their own employers, citing the rising cost and a growing number of spouses added to its medical plans.The hospital system reversed cou... - The Buffalo News", "title": "Issue of spousal coverage in health plans flares as Catholic Health restores benefit  - The Buffalo News", "url": "http://www.buffalonews.com/city-region/medical/issue-of-spousal-coverage-in-health-plans-flares-as-catholic-health-restores-benefit-20141028", "image": "http://www.buffalonews.com/images/BNSocialShareLG.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TheBuffaloNews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": "51000084,100004991951001"}, "__sync_contentCategory": "PayWall", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce7c6\"", "article_summary": "The average yearly premium for employer-sponsored family health benefits rose by 3 percent this year, to $16,834, according to the latest Employer Health Benefits Survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research & Educational Trust.\nWhile Catholic Health changed its mind, more companies are imposing limits on coverage of workers\u2019 spouses to hold down the price of employee health benefits.\nCatholic Health officials said they began discussing a spousal exclusion two years ago, after noticing an uptick in spouses coming onto their plans.\nThe overall cost of employees\u2019 health insurance rose by $20 million in the last four years, with nearly $6 million of that due to spouses\u2019 health care, Moley said.\nHowever, Catholic Health said that retaining the spouses would lead to a larger increase in premium costs for next year."}
