A judge has found sufficient evidence for a Lawrence man to stand trial in the stabbing and bludgeoning death of a woman.

The Lawrence Journal-World reports that 19-year-old Rontarus Washington Jr. was bound over for trial Friday in the November killing of 19-year-old Justina Altamirano Mosso. Washington is jailed in Douglas County on a first-degree murder charge. He was arrested in January in Greenville, Mississippi.

Detectives said they found a fingerprint matching Washington's underneath a toilet tank lid believed to have been used to beat Mosso over the head.

Washington told investigators he found Mosso's body upon entering an unlocked apartment looking for "change" but that he didn't tell anyone.

The apartment belonged to Mosso's estranged husband, Felipe Cantu Ruiz. The defense questioned Ruiz about the couple's strained relationship.
