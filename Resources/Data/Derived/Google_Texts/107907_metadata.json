(Stock photo: Tabitha Kaylee Hawk via Flickr)\n\nGeorgia\u2019s state House passed a bill late Monday designed to push back against the federal Affordable Care Act. It now goes to the state Senate.\n\nThe legislation would prevent state government from helping in the implementation and enforcement of the law also known as \"Obamacare.\"\n\nIt's a politically charged proposal, but the practical effect would be highly limited, said Chris Tsavatewa, chair of the Health Services Administration program at Middle Georgia State College.\n\nIn part, that\u2019s because Georgia is already not cooperating on the most important components of the ACA that depend on state action, he said.\n\n\u201cGeorgia opted out of the opportunity to expand Medicaid, and has take on the position that the opportunity to expand the insurance marketplace through an exchange was not something they were interested in participating in at all,\u201d Tsavatewa said.\n\nGeorgia residents are instead purchasing insurance through the ACA using the federal exchange.\n\nThe legislation would, however, have one definite effect, Tsavatewa said.\n\n\u201cGeorgia has a navigator program supported by the (state) university system that helps individuals to become aware and informed and ultimately sign up for health insurance, and that would be eliminated,\u201d he said.\n\nThe bill also forbids Georgia\u2019s elected insurance commissioner from enforcing the new federal standards for insurance companies established by the ACA.\n\n\u201cThe provision of free preventative healthcare, that insurance programs have to let people stay on their parent\u2019s insurance until the age of 26, preexisting (condition) coverage \u2014 that will not be evaluated by the state insurance commissioner,\u201d Tsavatewa said.\n\nGeorgia residents who believe their insurance companies are not complying with federal standards might still have some form of legal recourse, he said.\n\n\u201cThe assumption is there may be some possibilities for individuals to be able to pursue these insurance companies under civil penalty for non-compliance to a federal statute,\u201d Tsavatewa said.\n\nEven if the state insurance commissioner won\u2019t enforce the new standards, insurance companies are likely to follow them anyway, Tsavatewa said.\n\n\u201cI think that we have seen the institutionalization of a lot of these reforms\u2026free preventative care, covering those who are very risk-averse on their parent\u2019s plans until they\u2019re 26 \u2014 (these) are things that are going to become standard in the industry,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"meta_title": "Expert: Georgia Can't Do Much More To Stop Affordable Care Act", "medium": "News", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Georgia Public Broadcasting", "description": "Georgia\u2019s state House passed a bill late Monday designed to push back against the federal Affordable Care Act by preventing state government from helping in the implementation and enforcement of the law also known as \"Obamacare.\"", "title": "Expert: Georgia Can't Do Much More To Stop Affordable Care Act", "url": "http://www.gpb.org/news/2014/03/04/expert-georgia-cant-do-much-more-to-stop-affordable-care-act", "image": "http://www.gpb.org/sites/www.gpb.org/files/news/images/body/7458320560_a195f17bef_b.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-03-04T06:16:36-05:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.gpb.org/news/2014/03/04/expert-georgia-cant-do-much-more-to-stop-affordable-care-act", "image": {"src": "http://www.gpb.org/sites/www.gpb.org/files/news/images/body/7458320560_a195f17bef_b.jpg"}, "title": "Expert: Georgia Can't Do Much More To Stop Affordable Care Act", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mygpb"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-04T03:44:11-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-04T06:16:36-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0e5a\"", "article_summary": "Tuesday, March 4, 2014 - 3:44amExpert: Georgia Can't Do Much More To Stop Affordable Care ActGeorgia\u2019s state House passed a bill late Monday designed to push back against the federal Affordable Care Act.\nEven if the state insurance commissioner won\u2019t enforce the new standards, insurance companies are likely to follow them anyway, Tsavatewa said.\nThe bill also forbids Georgia\u2019s elected insurance commissioner from enforcing the new federal standards for insurance companies established by the ACA.\n(Stock photo: Tabitha Kaylee Hawk via Flickr)Georgia\u2019s state House passed a bill late Monday designed to push back against the federal Affordable Care Act.\nGeorgia residents who believe their insurance companies are not complying with federal standards might still have some form of legal recourse, he said."}
