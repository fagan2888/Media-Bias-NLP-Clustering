On March 25, the Supreme Court will hear arguments from companies that want to violate this law. Here is a story from one of the many women whose boss has tried to deny her birth control. For fear of losing her job, she requested to remain anonymous. Alice is not her real name.\n\nIn my household, like many these days, money is tight.\n\nMy husband and I and our two young children are struggling to make ends meet. We\u2019re barely managing to pay our car insurance, the rent on our one-bedroom home, and our child-care provider\u2014never mind my student loans. After all of these expenses, finding money to pay for birth control is a real challenge. But we wouldn\u2019t be in this position at all if the Archdiocese weren\u2019t allowed to interfere with my health care decisions by withholding contraception coverage in my health insurance.\n\nLet me explain. As a teacher at a Catholic primary school, I receive my insurance through the regional Archdiocese, which has refused to allow insurance coverage for birth control or sterilization.\n\nHaving to pay out-of-pocket for birth control means that I have to make important health care decisions based on cost rather than on what\u2019s best for me and my family. After my daughter was born two years ago, my husband and I were not ready for another child. My doctor recommended that I take a particular kind of birth control pill that would be safest for me while I breastfed her\u2013but there was no generic version available, and the brand name one cost several hundred dollars per month. I couldn\u2019t afford that, so I went without birth control while breast-feeding and became pregnant again just seven months after my first child was born. I love my son and am so grateful to have him in my life. But the fact is this: My husband and I would not have gotten pregnant at that time, if I had been able to afford the pill that my doctor recommended.\n\nNow that we have two children, I absolutely cannot get pregnant again. We just can\u2019t afford to care for a third child. I desperately want to get my tubes tied or have an intrauterine device inserted, but those options can cost hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars. For now, I\u2019ve asked my doctor to prescribe the cheapest birth control pills that work for my body\u2014and it\u2019s still hard to find an extra $25 each month to pay for them.\n\nI was therefore relieved to learn that the contraception rule will require employers to cover birth control without any co-pay.
