SILVERSTONE, England (AP) — Lewis Hamilton seized back control of the British Grand Prix after being overtaken on the first corner to win his fifth race of the season on Sunday and strengthen his Formula One title defense.

A Mercedes one-two was just as forecast — with Nico Rosberg completing a ninth consecutive double podium for the team — but a thrilling rain-affected race defied gloomy paddock talk about the predictability of the sport.

Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari was third.

Back-to-back wins at Silverstone for Hamilton gave the home fans just what they wanted from the pole-sitter, who fought back after dropping down to third at the start.

The victory extends Hamilton’s lead over Rosberg in the championship to 17 points.
