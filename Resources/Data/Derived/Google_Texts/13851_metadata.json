Ted Cruz (R-Texas), despite protest from some members and former members.\n\nThe caucus\u2019s executive committee met on Monday to discuss the choice, after some members threatened to resign, calling the selection too partisan and pointing to Cruz\u2019s stance on net neutrality.\n\nThe caucus, chaired by Norman Powell, said in a statement that Cruz will receive the award along with another honoree who is a Democrat.\n\n\u201cAs always, to balance the event, the caucus is also reaching out to a prominent Democrat,\u201d the caucus said in a statement. \u201cThe caucus will also present to a nonpartisan figure who provides outstanding humanitarian service to the industry.\u201d\n\nThe other awardees will be be announced shortly.\n\nCruz would join a list of past Republican honorees like then-Rep.
