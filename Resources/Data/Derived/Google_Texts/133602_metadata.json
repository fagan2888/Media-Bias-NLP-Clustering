You don\u2019t ask them anything, they just start telling you.\u201d\n\nShe said that the mediums she spoke with dispensed accurate information.\n\nSmith said that she is interested in \u201call modalities of healing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt each booth (here) you learn something new about the mind and body,\u201d she said. \u201cThey used to do this at the (Florida State Fairgrounds), but this is a much better location.\u201d\n\nBeth Snyder, director of operations at The Florida Institute of Hypnotherapy in Tampa, said the event was an effective way to market the state-licensed school, which opened in 2007 and offers courses in hypnotherapy, clinical hypnotherapy and transpersonal hypnotherapy, which she described as having \u201cmore of a spiritual bend.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re trained on past-life regressions,\u201d Snyder said of the transpersonal hypnotherapy course. \u201cIt explores your soul\u2019s journey, your karmic journey.\u201d\n\nThe two-day event also featured speakers. At 11 a.m. Saturday, certified medium Deborah Richmond Foulkes delivered a talk titled \u201cTalking to Dead People.\u201d One of the last speakers of the weekend was Ginger Ravencroft, who spoke Sunday afternoon on \u201cThe Powers of True Aromatherapy.\u201d\n\nBehind a table full of orange blossom, wildflower, saw palmetto, Tupelo, blueberry and gallberry honey samples was Monica Obando of Quail Hollow. For the past 18 months or so, Obando and her family have run Santa Monica Honey.\n\nObando said that bee stings helped her overcome severe arthritis pain.\n\n\u201cYou get 10 stings\u201d at a time,\u201d Obando said. \u201cI went three times a week for seven months. I consider myself healed. It doesn\u2019t happen overnight, but over time.\u201d\n\nObando said that the varieties of honey are beneficial in different ways. For instance, wildflower honey, helps with allergies, she said.\n\nSouth Africa native Sharon Bond sells all-natural, hand-poured soy candles in Clearwater.\n\nA candle meant for increasing energy smelled of mint and citrus, while one labeled \u201cSerenity\u201d contained lavender, rosemary, orange, ylang ylang and lemon and lime.\n\n\u201cAll of the soy is grown in America,\u201d Bond said. \u201cI make them all myself with essential oils, which are extracted from the plant, not chemically manufactured. When you inhale the oils, they act in your brain, and that\u2019s aromatherapy.\u201d\n\ngfox@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 731-8162", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 22 Jun 2014 19:29:43 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 Nora Smith of Tampa was 22 when she had her first psychic reading.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Nora Smith of Tampa was 22 when she had her first psychic reading.", "title": "Psychics, tarot card readers on hand for Body, Mind & Spirit Expo", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/psychics-taro-card-readers-on-hand-for-body-mind-spirit-expo-20140622/", "image": {"width": 2532, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140622/ARTICLE/140629761/AR/0/AR-140629761.jpg", "height": 1428}, "updated_time": "2014-06-22T20:38:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Nora Smith of Tampa was 22 when she had her first psychic reading.", "title": "Psychics, tarot card readers on hand for Body, Mind & Spirit Expo", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140622/ARTICLE/140629761/AR/0/AR-140629761.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-06-22T19:29:43Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-06-22T20:38:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A candle meant for increasing energy smelled of mint and citrus, while one labeled \u201cSerenity\u201d contained lavender, rosemary, orange, ylang ylang and lemon and lime.\nThe event featured 39 vendors, from psychics, tarot card and past-life readers to exhibitors selling all-natural soaps and perfume oils, aromatherapy implements and artwork.\nTAMPA \u2014 Nora Smith of Tampa was 22 when she had her first psychic reading.\n\u201cIt was in a back room,\u201d Trzcinka said, \u201cbehind a beaded curtain.\u201dOn Sunday, Smith and Trzcinka were among dozens of people at the Body, Mind & Spirit Expo at Sheraton Airport Westshore hotel, which started Saturday and ended Sunday afternoon.\nSmith said that she is interested in \u201call modalities of healing.\u201d\u201cAt each booth (here) you learn something new about the mind and body,\u201d she said."}
