Chris Christie says Sen. Rand Paul\u2019s views on the Fourth Amendment prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures are not only \u201cwrong\u201d but also would make America \u201cweaker and more vulnerable.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s politicizing America\u2019s national security,\u201d Christie said of Paul on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nChristie, who like Paul is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, said he has no idea whether the Kentucky senator\u2019s ideas are real but that he does know Paul has used them to raise money. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong, and his position is wrong,\u201d Christie said.\n\nPaul wouldn\u2019t know his position was incorrect because he\u2019s never had to use it, Christie suggested. His rival, he said, should be using his position to create more critical congressional oversight, and the Justice Department should be prosecuting people in the intelligence community who go too far.\n\nThe governor said during his time as a federal prosecutor he put terrorists in jail.\n\n\u201cI can tell the American people you can do this and you can do it well,\u201d Christie said, \u201cand if I\u2019m president, that\u2019s the kind of attorney general I\u2019ll appoint and that\u2019s the type of folks that I will put into my government to make sure that they\u2019re done \u2014 protecting civil liberties but protecting the homeland first and foremost.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The governor says during his time as a federal prosecutor he put terrorists in jail.", "title": "Christie: Paul is wrong on data collection", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/chris-christie-rand-paul-data-collection-119736.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/07/05/150705_chris_christie_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Chris Christie 2016,National Security,Fourth Amendment,Chris Christie,Data,Rand Paul,Rand Paul 2016", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The governor says during his time as a federal prosecutor he put terrorists in jail.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Christie: Paul is wrong on data collectionNew Jersey Gov.\n\u201cIt\u2019s wrong, and his position is wrong,\u201d Christie said.\nPaul wouldn\u2019t know his position was incorrect because he\u2019s never had to use it, Christie suggested.\nThe governor said during his time as a federal prosecutor he put terrorists in jail.\nHis rival, he said, should be using his position to create more critical congressional oversight, and the Justice Department should be prosecuting people in the intelligence community who go too far."}
