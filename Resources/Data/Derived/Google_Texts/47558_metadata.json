You know, people can be atheists or Christian or Jewish or whatever they want to be. You know, that\u2019s fine. But the thing here is \u2013 and I\u2019m not saying that we need to insert God in all of this, or insert religion into any of this \u2013 but the bottom line here is that President Obama thinks the government should be God, should make those decisions. And that, and you don\u2019t have to be a religious person for that to scare the living daylights out of you. People of every stripe should be running for the exits. STEVE MALZBERG, HOST: Now Charlie, let me ask you, we\u2019ve got over a minute. What\u2019s the chance the media will ever say what you just said? What\u2019s the chance the media will ever say what Sarah Palin said? HURT: Because media believes that government is God. They believe that your rights, all the rights that you are granted are somehow granted from the government. They don\u2019t believe that there is a natural, you know, granting of rights to people, and that this compact that we have with government. They don\u2019t believe in any of that, partly, of course, because none of them studied any of it in school. They\u2019ve never studied history. All they know is sort of conventional wisdom which is that, you know, \u201cOh, well you have a problem up there? Well the government needs to do something about that. There really should be a law about that.\u201d That\u2019s what the media does.\n\nIt sure is safe to say that secular liberals by and large do see government as there to bestow rights and liberties and take them away when it sees fit to do so.\n\nWith ObamaCare this has now extended to the government not only telling you you have to buy health insurance, but also what such insurance must cover whether it benefits you or not.\n\nAnd, in the case of Littlefield Sundby, she has now lost the very insurance that has kept her alive as a result of government defacto acting as God.\n\nWhere will it end?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NewsBusters", "description": "Washington Times columnist Charles Hurt wrote a piece Tuesday claiming that cancer survivor Edie Littlefield Sundby losing her health insurance as a result of ObamaCare proved former Alaska governor Sarah Palin\u2019s point regarding death panels.
