(AP) \u2014 The last two Americans being held captive by North Korea have returned home.\n\nKenneth Bae and Matthew Miller landed Saturday night at a Washington state military base after their departure from the reclusive Communist country was secured through a secret mission by the top U.S. intelligence official.\n\nBae, surrounded by family members, spoke briefly to the media after the plane carrying him and Miller landed about 9 p.m.\n\n\u201cI just want to say thank you all for supporting me and standing by me,\u201d he said.\n\nHe thanked President Barack Obama and the many people who supported him and his family. He also thanked the North Korean government for releasing him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing two years, I learned a lot, I grew a lot, I lost a lot of weight,\u201d said Bae, a Korean-American missionary with health problems. Asked how he was feeling, he said: \u201cI\u2019m recovering at this time.\u201d\n\nHis family has said he suffers from diabetes, an enlarged heart, liver problems and back pain.\n\nU.S. officials said Miller of Bakersfield, California, and Bae of Lynnwood, Washington, flew back with James Clapper, the director of national intelligence. Clapper was the highest-ranking American to visit Pyongyang in more than a decade.\n\nMembers of Bae\u2019s family, who live near the sprawling military base south of Seattle, met him when he landed. His mother hugged him after he got off the plane. Miller stepped off the U.S. government aircraft a short time later and was also greeted with hugs\n\nTheir release was the latest twist in the fitful relationship between the Obama administration and the young North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, whose approach to the U.S. has shifted back and forth from defiance to occasional conciliation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful day for them and their families,\u201d President Barack Obama said at the White House following his announcement of his pick for attorney general. \u201cObviously we are very grateful for their safe return.\u201d\n\nA senior Obama administration official said the president approved the mission last week and U.S. officials spent the next several days planning the trip. Clapper spent roughly a day on the ground and met with North Korean security officials \u2014 but not with Kim, the official said aboard Air Force One as Obama prepared to head to Beijing.\n\nClapper went with the sole purpose of bringing home the two detainees, although the U.S. anticipated that other issues of concern to the North would come up during Clapper\u2019s discussions on the ground, the official said. \u201cIt was not to pursue any other diplomatic opening,\u201d said the official, who wasn\u2019t authorized to comment by name and demanded anonymity.\n\nThe U.S. had considered sending someone from outside government to retrieve the detainees, the official said, but suggested Clapper after the North Koreans indicated in recent weeks that they would release the detainees if the U.S. sent a high-level official from Obama\u2019s administration. He said the U.S. settled on Clapper because of his role as a security official, rather than a diplomat.\n\nAnalysts who study North Korea said the decision to free Bae and Miller now from long prison terms probably was a bid by that country to ease pressure in connection with its human rights record. A recent U.N. report documented rape, torture, executions and forced labor in the North\u2019s network of prison camps, accusing the government of \u201cwidespread, systematic and gross\u201d human rights violations.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kenneth Bae: \u2018I just want to say thank you\u2019", "author": "Manuel Valdes and Ken Dilanian", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Kenneth Bae: \u2018I just want to say thank you\u2019", "title": "Kenneth Bae: \u2018I just want to say thank you\u2019", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/09/kenneth_bae_i_just_want_to_say_thank_you/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/aptopix-north-korea-freed-detainees.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kenneth Bae: \u2018I just want to say thank you\u2019", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/aptopix-north-korea-freed-detainees.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Kenneth Bae: \u2018I just want to say thank you\u2019", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Kenneth Bae: \u2018I just want to say thank you\u2019", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcffaf\"", "article_summary": "Bae, surrounded by family members, spoke briefly to the media after the plane carrying him and Miller landed about 9 p.m.\u201cI just want to say thank you all for supporting me and standing by me,\u201d he said.\nU.S. officials said Miller of Bakersfield, California, and Bae of Lynnwood, Washington, flew back with James Clapper, the director of national intelligence.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing two years, I learned a lot, I grew a lot, I lost a lot of weight,\u201d said Bae, a Korean-American missionary with health problems.\nKenneth Bae and Matthew Miller landed Saturday night at a Washington state military base after their departure from the reclusive Communist country was secured through a secret mission by the top U.S. intelligence official.\nHe thanked President Barack Obama and the many people who supported him and his family."}
