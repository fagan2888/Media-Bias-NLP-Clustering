Americans who hold private health insurance spent more on medical services in 2013 even though they used fewer of them, says a new report from the Health Care Cost Institute.

The Health Care Cost and Utilization Report found that health care spending averaged $4,864 per enrollee in 2013, up $183 from the year before.

Per capita expenditures rose by $181 from 2011 to 2012.

Falling utilization helped mask continued growth in health care prices, authors of the report state.

The analysis uses claims data from three of the nation's largest health insurance providers, looking at claims for nearly 40 million Americans who are covered by employer-sponsored health insurance. This group in 2013 accounted for more than 27 percent of the U.S. insured population.

Use of brand prescription drugs, inpatient admissions and outpatient services declined in 2013. Still, average prices increased for all three categories, and at higher rates than in 2012.

Out-of-pocket averages in 2013 among both men and women totaled $800 per consumer, a 4 percent increase over 2012. There was no increase in out-of-pocket spending for young adult women, though health care expenditures per capita were higher for women than for men in 2012.

Young adult women, or those aged 19 to 25, spent an average of $662 out of pocket, the same as the year before.

This was almost completely due to a drop in out-of-pocket spending on generic and brand hormone contraceptives, which are now covered by employers under a provision in the Affordable Care Act.

In 2013, adult women ages 19 to 54 had higher levels of outpatient and professional service use than adult men. But after age 54, the gender gap in use of these services narrowed, as men increase their use of radiology, laboratory and pathology services.

Out-of-pocket spending went down for both brand and generic prescriptions. Antidepressants were the most used generic drugs in 2013 among young adult men, intermediate adult men, middle aged adult women and pre-Medicare adult women. They account for 10 percent of all generic drug use. Generic prescription use overall increased in 2013 by 4.5 percent.

Brand name drugs are more expensive and discouraged by portions of the Affordable Care Act as a way to cut back on health spending. Still, the trend found in other portions of the report applied here. Total spending on brand name drugs grew 2.4 percent, yet their use dropped by 15.5 percent. The average price per filled day increased more than 21.2 percent.

Inpatient admissions and outpatient services declined in 2013, though average prices increased for both.

Acute inpatient hospital admissions fell 2.3 percent while prices rose 6.7 percent, causing overall inpatient spending to rise by 3.8 percent. The average price per admission grew by $1,101 in 2013 to $18,030.

Outpatient services declined by 0.8 percent while prices rose 6.4 percent, resulting in a total outpatient visit spending growth of 5.5 percent.

Though adults across various age groups use emergency room services differently, their spending was similar. Young adults, or those aged 19 to 25, visited the emergency room more often than older pre-Medicare adults, or those ages 55 to 64. Older adults, however, had a higher average price for their visits, due partially to use of more intensive care, the report says.

Because of this, amounts spent on emergency room visits were similar across those age groups. Spending on emergency room visits averaged $314 per capita for older adults, compared to $310 per young adult.

Some utilization of health care goods and services in 2013 increased. These included professional services, such office visits and lab tests. Preventive visits to primary care doctors and contraceptive hormone use both rose 5 percent.
