Presently, 10 states and the District of Columbia offer some form of driver\u2019s permit to illegals.\n\nBut some states are moving to repeal their laws due to rampant license fraud.\n\nNew Mexico and Colorado are in the process of denying licenses to undocumented immigrants, and Oregon and Tennessee, which formerly issued such licenses, have repealed their laws.\n\nIn January, Vermont\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles announced the discovery of more than 100 fraudulent applications from non-resident illegal aliens.\n\nWhile investigators have traced fraudulent applications to states including New York, Massachusetts and New Jersey, New Mexico\u2019s motor vehicle division chief says the fraud in her state is linked to international crime syndicates.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently issuing a driver\u2019s license, and we were seeing people come in not only from across the U.S. but from other countries,\u201d Demesia Padilla, cabinet secretary over the New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department, told Vermont Watchdog.\n\nPadilla, an appointee of New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, said issuing licenses to illegal immigrants has attracted the interest of international crime rings.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked with Border Patrol and with ICE because our fraud was coming from Mexico, Bolivia, China, the Middle East, you name it. They were coming from Georgia, New York, and Chicago, too,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to Padilla, undocumented immigrants pay thousands of dollars to obtain driving credentials.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very much a for-profit enterprise for these criminal elements. There were driver\u2019s licenses being sold for as much as $4,500. In almost every case, we were seeing that there was a ringleader who had put a lot of the pieces together,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThey have somebody that\u2019s willing to sell a fraudulent lease, somebody who is willing to do a fraudulent affidavit, somebody who\u2019s willing to collect the mail at a mailbox, knowing the applicant was no longer even in our state.\u201d\n\nUnlike Vermont, which has yet to issue formal charges against anyone, New Mexico has indicted multiple individuals for forgery and conspiracy in running illegal driver\u2019s license schemes.\n\nIn 2013, when Vermont debated S.38, which enabled undocumented immigrants to obtain driver\u2019s privilege cards, few opposed the legislation. The bill passed the Senate 27-2; the House approved by a vote of 105-39.\n\nDuring committee hearings, Vermont lawmakers received multiple warnings the legislation could become a magnet for fraud.\n\nIn the report to the House and Senate Committees on Transportation, Mark Williams, former director of New Mexico\u2019s Motor Vehicle Division, reportedly testified the effect of New Mexico\u2019s law had been to facilitate criminal fraud. Williams provided division records that showed a case in which 100 applicants listed the same apartment on their applications.\n\nWanda Adams, former assistant director at the Driver Services Division in Tennessee, testified that the state\u2019s certificate of driving attracted a flurry of fraudulent residence documents, and was becoming a de facto ID.\n\nPadilla says the problem is so great states have no choice but to repeal.\n\n\u201cOur problem is huge. The thing I can tell Vermont is that as soon as you see a pattern developing, you have to respond quickly and recognize that they find a workaround to any roadblock you put up,\u201d she said.\n\nPadilla advises Vermont prosecutors to go after organizers of the fraud.\n\n\u201cWe would call the individuals in to do a face-to-face interview with one of our investigators. It was at that time that they would tell us, \u2018I paid so and so for this,\u2019 and they would help us get to the ringleaders,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMost of our cases were focused on the ringleader. Our district attorneys were much more willing to take on those kinds of cases.\u201d\n\nPopular opinion appears to be turning against issuing credentials to illegal immigrants. In November, Oregon, a state dominated by Democrats, voted to repeal its law by a 68-33 margin.\n\nPadilla says New Mexicans are also in favor of ending the practice.\n\n\u201cThere was a poll in our local newspaper, and 70 percent of New Mexicans believe that the right thing to do is repeal the issuance of driver\u2019s licenses to undocumented immigrants.\u201d\n\nContact Bruce Parker at bparker@watchdog.org", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The head of New Mexico\u2019s motor vehicle division warns Vermont that driver\u2019s license fraud may be international in scope.", "title": "New Mexico cabinet secretary to Vermont: Driver\u2019s license fraud rampant, international - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/02/DemesiaPadilla-NewMexico-AP.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-16T13:09:58+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/202943/drivers-license-fraud-international/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Issues", "tag": "Fraud", "published_time": "2015-02-27T08:36:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-16T13:09:58+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The head of New Mexico\u2019s motor vehicle division warns Vermont that driver\u2019s license fraud may be international in scope.", "title": "New Mexico cabinet secretary to Vermont: Driver\u2019s license fraud rampant, international - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/02/DemesiaPadilla-NewMexico-AP.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "The head of New Mexico\u2019s motor vehicle division warns Vermont that driver\u2019s license fraud may be international in scope."}, "article_summary": "In 2013, when Vermont debated S.38, which enabled undocumented immigrants to obtain driver\u2019s privilege cards, few opposed the legislation.\nBruce Parker | Vermont WatchdogAs an investigation into driver\u2019s license fraud in Vermont expands to multiple states, the head of New Mexico\u2019s motor vehicle division says the problem is international in scope.\nThere were driver\u2019s licenses being sold for as much as $4,500.\nAccording to Padilla, undocumented immigrants pay thousands of dollars to obtain driving credentials.\nNew Mexico and Colorado are in the process of denying licenses to undocumented immigrants, and Oregon and Tennessee, which formerly issued such licenses, have repealed their laws."}
