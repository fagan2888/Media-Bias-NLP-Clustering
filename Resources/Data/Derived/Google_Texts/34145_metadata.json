He\u2019s also a resource for entrepreneurs and an advocate of financial literacy education. The author of several best-selling books, including the No. 1 personal finance book of all time, \u201cRich Dad Poor Dad,\u201d Kiyosaki makes an impact on millions of readers\u2019 and listeners\u2019 lives. He also hosts a weekly podcast titled \u201cThe Rich Dad Radio Show,\u201d which updates every Wednesday.\n\nRobert Kiyosaki\u2019s Best Financial Advice for 2015\n\nAs an expert in investing, as well as business and personal development, we asked Robert what the No. 1 thing is that Americans can do to set themselves up for financial success in 2015. Here was his response:\n\n\u201cAmericans can stop seeing themselves as victims \u2014 of the job market, Obamacare fallout, economic downturns, and the uncertain future of programs like Social Security and Medicare \u2014 and stop relying on someone else to \u2018save\u2019 them,\u201d Kiyosaki said. \u201cA shift in mindset (from \u2018victim\u2019 to \u2018champ\u2019) and a decision to put your talents, your intelligence and your strengths to work will set you up to take control of your life and your financial future.\n\n\u201cIt starts with education, especially financial education \u2026 so make 2015 the year you champion your life and take control. Can\u2019t find a job? Challenge yourself to create one for yourself. Want to start generating passive income and building assets? Do it! Find a mentor. Start a blog or podcast. Write an e-book. License your killer salsa recipe. Or join a network marketing company. You\u2019re smart and creative and talented \u2026 so use those talents, learn more about money and business and investing, and champion \u2014 and change \u2014 your life in 2015.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s your choice. Will you keep letting yourself fall victim to life\u2019s curve balls? Or will you hit it out of the park by putting the power of financial education behind every swing you take in your game of life?\u201d\n\nIncreased efficacy and accountability are Kiyosaki\u2019s recommendations for those seeking to improve their financial health in 2015. Rather than blame circumstances, he encourages people to take ownership over their successes \u2014 in their finances and in their career \u2014 to reach their goals.\n\nOne way to do this is through entrepreneurship. The job you want might not be easily found on a job site, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have the career you\u2019ve always dreamed of and the financial security that comes with it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As an expert in investing, as well as business and personal development, we asked Robert Kiyosaki what the No. 1 thing is that Americans can do to set themselves up for financial success in 2015.
