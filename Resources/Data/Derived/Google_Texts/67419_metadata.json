They\u2019ll be earning more money, thanks to the state\u2019s minimum wage hike \u2014 but they\u2019ll also be paying more to live.\n\nAdded room & board costs are just one way processing plants are hoping to offset the wage increase.\n\nAlyeska and Westward Seafoods have never charged for room & board. But on June 1, president Mark Johanson says that\u2019ll change.\n\n\u201cThis has been a very, very hard, soul-searching decision for us,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to buck the trend, and make it a reasonable and a good place for people to work. The work is hard and challenging, and we understand that \u2026 but because of global competition and pressures, we have had to unfortunately make that decision.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re implementing the state\u2019s maximum room & board charge of $15 a day at their shoreside plants in Unalaska. Johanson says it comes out to about a dollar of every hour\u2019s wages, including overtime. Since the minimum wage also went up a dollar this year, he says the changes are a wash, for now.\n\n\u201cAnd then, of course, as of Jan. 1, [2016], the minimum wage will increase again by a dollar,\u201d he says \u201cSo there is no remedy on room & board \u2014 we\u2019ll just need to either eat that cost or find other ways to become more efficient in our operation.\u201d\n\nJohanson\u2019s also worried about the $1 to $4 million cost of adding employee health coverage under the Affordable Care Act. So in the long term, he\u2019s hoping to pare down, and automate more of their processing lines.\n\nThat\u2019s going to happen at UniSea, too. Unalaska\u2019s biggest seafood processor has plans to shrink its pollock operations back into one factory in the next few years.\n\nThey\u2019re also upping their room & board charge. It\u2019s started at $10 a day for the past couple of years, decreasing the more a processor works. But this spring, facing a $3 million cost bump from minimum wage, president Tom Enlow says they\u2019ve gone to the upper limit, too.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not really in a position to just take that cost \u2014 any cost increase, for that matter \u2014 and pass it onto our customers,\u201d he says.\n\nThat\u2019s because they\u2019re working with set market prices for seafood, where costs are shared between the harvesters and the processors. Since the wage hike impacts the processors, Enlow says they may want to renegotiate those price formulas down the line.\n\nBut for now, room & board is their first line of defense, along with some cuts to staffing. That\u2019s come through the natural attrition Enlow says they see at the start of every season.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be a certain amount of workers that come up and say \u2018Oh, I had no idea I was going to have to work all day,\u2019 and they end up leaving,\u201d he says.\n\nThis year, UniSea wanted to see how low they could go. They didn\u2019t rehire for those empty jobs, and went through A season about 80 people short.\n\n\u201cOur crab and cod throughput always suffers when our headcount is down below a certain number, and we certainly saw that take place this year,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s just all in an effort to try to hold those costs down.\u201d\n\nIn pollock B season \u2014 which covers 60 percent of the year\u2019s huge quota \u2014 they\u2019ll move staff around and focus on producing surimi. Right now, there\u2019s a better market for the imitation crab product than there is for fillets.\n\nOver at Alyeska and Westward, president Mark Johanson says they\u2019re keeping their headcount the same for now. In fact, they\u2019ve had to work harder than normal to recruit to fill those jobs.\n\nWith higher wages up against room & board costs, and an improving job market down south, Johanson says it\u2019s not as easy as it once was lure new processors up to Alaska.\n\nRelated articles\n\nComments", "article_metadata": {"category": "Economy,Featured News,Fisheries", "description": "In the next few weeks, thousands of seafood processors will return to Unalaska for pollock B season.
