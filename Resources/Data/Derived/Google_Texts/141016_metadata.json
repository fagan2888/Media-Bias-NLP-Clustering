Ruth Bader Ginsburg gets it. Even the satanists get it. The Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby decision is an ongoing disaster that damages real women\u2019s lives, and there is nothing limited about it. One of the basic misunderstandings apparent in the case is that birth control is something low-income workers can simply afford to pay for out-of-pocket when their employers deny them coverage. They can\u2019t. But no matter how many times people type or shout or scribble that fact on protest signs, it\u2019s still not as clear as a picture.\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\nSo here is a picture, courtesy of the This Is Personal campaign:\n\nAs the infographic shows, it can take days, weeks or months of work for low-income employees to be able to pay for necessary contraceptive care.
