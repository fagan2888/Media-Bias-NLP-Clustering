File photo\n\nLorna Nagler\n\nPresident, Bealls Department Stores | Retail\n\nCompany: Nagler expects a strong year for the chain\u2019s department stores, which have locations in nearly every market in Florida. One reason for optimism is a slew of new brands and products, from Under Armour to new Tommy Bahama offerings. A revamped women\u2019s shoe section is also upcoming. \u201cWe\u2019ve curated the best of the best,\u201d says Nagler. \u201cWe want to surprise and delight.\u201d\n\nAnother reason for optimism: The 2015 debut of Bunulu, a millennial-focused chain with a concentration on athletic clothes and active wear. There are three stores so far, including one in Estero, and Nagler says inventory buyers for Bunulu continue to refine the right mix of fashion and function. There are no plans to open a store in 2016, yet, but Nagler says a site selection process is ongoing.\n\nIndustry: Retailers are at a crossroads in 2016, says Nagler, in the escalating battle for customers\u2019 attention, given the increase in gadgets people can buy and life-experience trips people can take. That means companies that sell clothes are competing not only against each other, but also against where people spend their money. Nagler, for example, considers Amazon and Apple competitors as much as Kohl\u2019s or JC Penney. \u201cShare of wallet is something we really worry about,\u201d says Nagler. \u201cThat\u2019s why we work so hard to be special and unique.\u201d\n\nRegion: Outside retail, Nagler especially watches what happens in housing and tourism. And the news there, in her view, is great. Nagler says the influx of tourists and snowbirds, combined with the increase in housing starts, should be a boost for 2016, and maybe beyond, for many businesses and industries. \u201cWe love to see the cranes in the sky,\u201d says Nagler. \u201cThat bodes well for us.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Mark Gordon\n\nEd Chiles\n\nOwner, Beach House, Sandbar and Mar Vista restaurants | Hospitality\n\nCompany: Business has been solid for Chiles\u2019 restaurants, mostly because of the prospering economy. Fall 2016 will bring some major improvements, too. Chiles says the company is continuing with the remaking of its restaurants, which started in 2011. Building a culinary team has been another focal point, and that will continue into 2016.\n\nHealth care coverage poses an enormous challenge for the company, much like other industries. For Chiles, he chose between restructuring the amount of full-time employees or eating a large companywide cost to cover everyone through the Affordable Care Act. He opted for the latter and says health care costs increased $100,000 as a result.\n\nIndustry: In the food and beverage industry, risk is always a major factor, Chiles says. And the industry faces the possibility of another hurdle: minimum wage increases. \u201cTo give you an honest answer, I don\u2019t know,\u201d says Chiles on how an increased minimum wage would impact the industry. \u201cI think the good operators will get through. But a lot of people go out of business in this industry.\u201d\n\nThe key, he says, is intensely monitoring costs and holding tight to a budget.\n\nRegion: Chiles and his restaurants \u201chave some incredibly good things going for us,\u201d he says. Most notable to Chiles is the \u201cbooming island economy,\u201d which is based on a great quality of life and a strong marine environment, he says. Despite the recession in 2008, \u201cwe\u2019re one of the few places that wasn\u2019t hurt business-wise,\u201d Chiles says. He adds that there is a sense of vitality now that wasn\u2019t present 20 years ago because the region is attracting people worldwide. \u201cI think we\u2019re all damn glad that we put down our roots here 30 years ago,\u201d Chiles says.\n\n\u2014 Steve Benna\n\nCraig Johnson, Lisa Krouse\n\nCEO; Executive Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer, FCCI Insurance Group | Insurance\n\nCompany: Johnson is excited about 2016, coming off what he says was an outstanding 2015 for the firm, which handles commercial property and casualty insurance in 18 states, mostly in the Southeast and Midwest. The firm will finish 2015 with $740 million in written premiums, up 10.4% over 2014, when it had $670 million.\n\nJohnson and Krause say they want the payroll to stay ahead of growth trends, and expect to hire 90 people in the next 18 months. At least one-third of those will be based out of the firm\u2019s Lakewood Ranch headquarters, adds Krause. One of the largest private employers in the Sarasota-Manatee region, FCCI currently has around 760 employees.\n\nJohnson says the growth comes mostly from the sales force outworking the competition and FCCI\u2019s stellar customer service reputation. \u201cWe are getting more penetration in our markets,\u201d Johnson says.\n\nIndustry: One theme for 2016 in insurance, says Johnson, will be a rate battle. He predicts some carriers and underwriters will drop prices so low to undercut competition, which happens sometimes in the cyclical industry, particularly in a rebounding economy. But if prices go too low, says Johnson, it has the potential to erode profitability. \u201cThey are trying to generate business,\u201d Johnson says of companies that lower rates. \u201cBut we think it\u2019s an unwise move.\u201d\n\nRegion: Krouse, recently named chairwoman of the board of the Greater Sarasota Chamber of Commerce, says she hears positive vibes from multiple businesses and executives in the area. Johnson also sees good things in 2016 \u2014 though he has some caution given it\u2019s an election year. Says Krause: \u201cThere is a general feeling of optimism for what\u2019s happening in the community.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Mark Gordon\n\nJoe Finney\n\nCEO, Environmental Pest Service| Pest control, home services\n\nCompany: Environmental Pest Service, formerly Arrow Environmental Services, has been on a grow-by-acquisition strategy since 2010. It\u2019s acquired around 70 firms since then, in Florida and Georgia, and has become one of the top 25 pest control companies in the country based on revenues. While several more acquisitions are forthcoming, says Finney, the company will also focus on organic growth in 2016 through new clients and more services for current clients. That includes lawn care.\n\nPart of the strategy to boost organic growth next year, says Finney, is the debut of an internal training program called We Care. It\u2019s where field technicians and service reps will share experiences and learn new techniques about how to improve service. \u201cWe want people to treat our customers like it\u2019s their grandmother\u2019s house,\u201d Finney says.\n\nIndustry: The pest control sector is relatively stable, says Finney. He expects the industry to grow around 3% to 4% in 2016. A looming obstacle to growth, he says, is something that confounds executives in many other fields: hiring talented employees. \u201cThe biggest challenge is people,\u201d says Finney. \u201cWe always say our most important assets drive home every night.\u201d\n\nRegion: Finney believes the Florida economy will grow faster than the rest of the country in 2016. He sees that happening in several areas, including real estate. Finney says that will trickle down to Environmental Pest Service, which targets areas such as Ocala and Gainesville for acquisitions. \u201cI really like the Florida market,\u201d Finney says. \u201cWe see a lot of potential here.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Mark Gordon\n\nElizabeth Rose\n\nReal estate agent, Coldwell Banker | Residential real estate\n\nCompany: The rebound of the housing market has been good to Rose: She had six closings in November \u2014 the most she\u2019s ever had in a single month during her seven-year tenure as a real estate agent.\n\nRose is hopeful the market will stay as strong as it is. \u201cI don\u2019t have a crystal ball, although I wish I did,\u201d Rose says. \u201cBut if we continue along this trajectory, there\u2019s a very bright outlook for 2016.\u201d\n\nIndustry: An increased emphasis on technology and photography has completely changed the industry, Rose says. Buyers used to completely rely on agents to pick out homes based on predetermined interests. But technology and photography have become key to the process because now \u201cbuyers can search and give Realtors a list of specific properties they want to see, not the other way around like it used to be.\u201d With that, buyers can now search almost in real time, Rose says.\n\nAnother industry trend to note, says Rose: A lot more people are getting into the profession. Whether they obtained their license in the past or are interested now, \u201cit\u2019s definitely a good time to be in this industry.\u201d\n\nRegion: Sarasota-Manatee is in the middle of a strong sellers market, Rose says. Home prices are higher, while the number of available listings and average amount of time a property stays on the market is down.\n\n\u201cPeople are more willing to pull the trigger with an offer,\u201d Rose says. \u201cAnd now that the market has gained momentum, people are giving stronger offers to avoid losing out on a property that they love.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Steve Benna\n\nFor more data on the Gulf Coast\u2019s economy, see our by the numbers charts.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.review.net/images/uploads/articles/144799364434.jpg"}, "google-site-verification": "JalKV1popb1teFf_ssEuY-my27ipKpHj0ufGnPXNYU0", "Description": "This is a milestone of sorts for the Business Observer\u2019s annual economic forecast issue: It\u2019s the second year in a row that cautious optimism isn\u2019t the overriding theme of the day."}, "article_summary": "Says Krause: \u201cThere is a general feeling of optimism for what\u2019s happening in the community.\u201d\u2014 Mark GordonJoe FinneyCEO, Environmental Pest Service| Pest control, home servicesCompany: Environmental Pest Service, formerly Arrow Environmental Services, has been on a grow-by-acquisition strategy since 2010.\nFinney says that will trickle down to Environmental Pest Service, which targets areas such as Ocala and Gainesville for acquisitions.\n\u201cBut if we continue along this trajectory, there\u2019s a very bright outlook for 2016.\u201dIndustry: An increased emphasis on technology and photography has completely changed the industry, Rose says.\n\u201cI really like the Florida market,\u201d Finney says.\nThere are no plans to open a store in 2016, yet, but Nagler says a site selection process is ongoing."}
