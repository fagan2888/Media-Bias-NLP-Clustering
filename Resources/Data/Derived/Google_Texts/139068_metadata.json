Corbett.\n\nThe flying banner will read \"Gov. Corbett loves Cowboys - hates PA families.\"\n\n\u201cThe banner is a fun way to draw attention to Corbett\u2019s Medicaid scheme,\u201d said Keystone Progress Executive Director Michael Morrill. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure if Corbett really loves the Cowboys, but we know that Corbett\u2019s Medicaid plan is really back-door privatization and is another giveaway to corporations.\"\n\n\n\nThe group also will hand out mock Tom Corbett football cards - which say Corbett is quarterback of the \"Keystone Privateers\" - outside the stadium.(Keystone Progress plans a similar fly over and card hand out at Heinz Field ahead of the Pittsburgh Steelers game.)\n\n\n\nCorbett last month announced he would take the federal dollars to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, but wants to use private insurers to cover roughly 500,000 uninsured Pennsylvanians.\n\nThe federal program launches in January and will be covered 100 percent by the federal government for the first three years but it is unclear when the state plan might start because it needs federal approval.\n\n\n\nMorrill says the Corbett proposal is wrong because it channels people into for-profit insurance plans, penalizes working families by requiring them to pay premiums to enroll and will institute a work search requirement.\n\nArkansas recently received a federal waiver to implement a private Medicaid plan. Corbett also is seeking a waiver but has not yet presented a formal plan. Medicaid advocates say there is no precedent for a work-search requirement and it is unlikely to be approved.\n\n\n\n\n\n--\n\nClick here for Philly.com's politics page.", "article_metadata": {"pubdate": 20160526, "editdate": "20131020T06:20:27", "twitter": {"title": "Group plans football flyover to protest Corbett Medicaid plan", "url": "http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/harrisburg_politics/Group-plans-football-flyover-to-protest-Corbett-Medicaid-plan.html", "image": "http://media.philly.com/images/1012013-Corbett-Cowboys.jpg", "creator": "@AngelasInk", "site": "@phillydotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "cg": "news", "keywords": "Commonwealth Confidential", "description": "A liberal political group is taking the state's Medicaid battle to Lincoln Field. - Commonwealth Confidential, Philadelphia Inquirer", "byline": "Commonwealth Confidential", "contenttype": "Blog_Post", "publication": "Philadelphia Inquirer", "title": "Group plans football flyover to protest Corbett Medicaid plan", "livedate": "20131020T06:20:27", "verify-v1": "3x82DC93LZlv0I/hQEBoyVVjlGPtX7VxHFgv1upr+9I=", "news_keywords": "Commonwealth Confidential", "contentid": 228526511, "DC.date.issued": "2013-10-20T06:20:27-04:00", "fb": {"app_id": 938226082960499}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"site_name": "Philly.com", "description": "A liberal political group is taking the state's Medicaid battle to Lincoln Field.", "title": "Group plans football flyover to protest Corbett Medicaid plan", "url": "http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/harrisburg_politics/Group-plans-football-flyover-to-protest-Corbett-Medicaid-plan.html", "image": "http://media.philly.com/images/1012013-Corbett-Cowboys.jpg", "type": "article"}, "searchdate": "2013-10-20", "google-site-verification": "db3T5L3C8_JvO-55gJ22lGGUnZLlNulgzTwX1NhCV3o", "y_key": "ccf0cd67e5f1e33c", "sourcepublication": "Inquirer"}, "article_summary": "The group also will hand out mock Tom Corbett football cards - which say Corbett is quarterback of the \"Keystone Privateers\" - outside the stadium.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not sure if Corbett really loves the Cowboys, but we know that Corbett\u2019s Medicaid plan is really back-door privatization and is another giveaway to corporations.\"\nArkansas recently received a federal waiver to implement a private Medicaid plan.\n(Keystone Progress plans a similar fly over and card hand out at Heinz Field ahead of the Pittsburgh Steelers game.)\nMedicaid advocates say there is no precedent for a work-search requirement and it is unlikely to be approved."}
