Cheney made his comments at a POLITICO Playbook lunch conversation with his wife, Lynne, and daughter Liz at Washington\u2019s Mayflower Renaissance Hotel, a lively event that featured jokes, a standing-room-only crowd and a few interruptions \u2014 protesters delayed the event twice, screaming at the former vice president for being a \u201cwar criminal.\u201d\n\n\u201cDick Cheney should be arrested for war crimes!\u201d one protester screamed before being escorted out. \u201cYou destroyed Iraq, DC! You destroyed Iraq!\u201d\n\n( PHOTOS: Playbook lunch with the Cheneys)\n\n\u201cI wondered why the line was so long\u201d for the event, Lynne Cheney joked in response.\n\nThe three Cheneys \u2014 who rarely appear together \u2014 struck a largely defiant tone on many of the major political and policy issues of the day, from national security to electoral politics. On one occasion, Liz Cheney was asked what the Republican Party should do on climate change. \u201cNothing,\u201d she said, adding that the Obama administration\u2019s climate change policies are a thinly veiled attack on the coal industry. \u201cIt is bad policy. It is bad science,\u201d she argued, saying that the growth of bureaucracy and the Environmental Protection Agency is a bigger threat to the U.S. than climate change.\n\nMike Allen, POLITICO\u2019s chief White House correspondent, began the event by asking Dick Cheney about his decision to lambaste the Obama administration over its foreign policy, particularly in contrast to former President George W. Bush, who has declined to criticize the president since he left office.\n\nCiting a decades-long precedent of former presidents refusing to criticize their successors, Cheney said: \u201cI\u2019m not bound by those strictures.\"\n\n( Rand Paul's column for POLITICO: Rick Perry is dead wrong)\n\nThe former vice president continued to slam Obama, saying that \u201cloves to run around \u2026 telling us Al Qaeda\u2019s dead,\u201d despite problems in the Middle East region. Cheney also said that the president inherited a stable situation in Iraq from the Bush administration but that his desire for a full withdrawal has led to the situation today.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Obama ever had any intention of leaving anybody behind,\u201d he added, saying that he thought Obama wasn\u2019t fully committed to a status of forces agreement with Iraq given his desire to get all troops out of Iraq. The president presided over the withdrawal of all troops from the country in 2011.\n\nCheney also criticized Obama for having \u201cdramatically reduced the military.\u201d He later called budget cuts at the Pentagon \u201coutrageous\u201d and said that the next U.S. president needs to \u201crebuild the United States military.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat ought to be our top priority for spending, not food stamps,\u201d he said, invoking a popular Republican criticism that spending on food stamps has increased under the Obama administration.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Citigroup reaches $7B deal with feds)\n\nCheney has been harshly critical of the administration\u2019s foreign policy throughout Obama\u2019s presidency, and has chimed in recently over the deteriorating situation in Iraq, where militants from the Islamic State of Syria and the Levant have taken over much of the northern and central parts of the country.\n\nHe said in other areas the president had exceeded \u201chis constitutional authority,\u201d particularly in regard to the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe bill was so bad that I thought it should have been repealed\u201d or, at a minimum, amended, Cheney said.\n\nThe former second lady also took aim at a high-level Democratic politician, jabbing at former Secretary of State and first lady Hillary Clinton. When recounting her family\u2019s political history, she said: \u201cWe weren\u2019t dead broke, excuse me,\u201d she said, poking fun at Hillary Clinton\u2019s comments that she and Bill were \u201cdead broke\u201d when they left the White House at the end of his two terms as president.\n\nWatch the full video below.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The former vice president defends the Bush administration\u2019s decision to invade Iraq.", "title": "Cheneys sound off after protests", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/dick-cheney-liz-cheney-iraq-protests-108873.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/07/14/140714_cheneys_playbooklunch_kp_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Liz Cheney,Iraq,Dick Cheney,Lynne Cheney", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The former vice president defends the Bush administration\u2019s decision to invade Iraq.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "You destroyed Iraq!\u201d( PHOTOS: Playbook lunch with the Cheneys)\u201cI wondered why the line was so long\u201d for the event, Lynne Cheney joked in response.\nThe three Cheneys \u2014 who rarely appear together \u2014 struck a largely defiant tone on many of the major political and policy issues of the day, from national security to electoral politics.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d she said, adding that the Obama administration\u2019s climate change policies are a thinly veiled attack on the coal industry.\nCiting a decades-long precedent of former presidents refusing to criticize their successors, Cheney said: \u201cI\u2019m not bound by those strictures.\"\n\u201cThe bill was so bad that I thought it should have been repealed\u201d or, at a minimum, amended, Cheney said."}
