There\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019ll land on your feet. And while a change in income is likely the most significant financial adjustment you\u2019ll encounter if you\u2019re newly unemployed, it\u2019s certainly not the only one worth your attention. A gap in your health insurance coverage could expose you to costly medical bills. But individuals who have found themselves in this pickle will be happy to know the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) gives you more options than ever for closing that gap.\n\nAbout half of all Americans receive health insurance through an employer, according to the latest data from the Kaiser Family Foundation. With the average annual premium for an employer-based plan hovering around $6,000 for individual coverage and $17,000 for families in 2014, your health benefits must play a part in your exit strategy.\n\nKnow your health insurance options\n\nThe ACA dramatically expanded options for former employees in need of health insurance. Because of the variety of plans available and the potential for money-saving subsidies on federal and state marketplaces, buying a new individual policy makes the most financial sense for many people. Prior to the ACA, COBRA\u2014 a set of laws allowing employees to keep employer-based benefits after leaving a job\u2014 was usually the best option.\n\nACA marketplace plans\n\nLosing employer-based health insurance is considered a \u201cqualifying event,\u201d one that allows you to enroll in an individual plan on the marketplace outside of the annual open enrollment period. Your exemption gives you 60 days to shop once you lose coverage, and you\u2019ll have access to a variety of plans, carriers and price points.\n\nREAD MORE: A Guide To Understanding Open Enrollment\n\nCOBRA insurance\n\nYou also have 60 days to opt into or decline COBRA. That clock starts ticking the day you receive notification about your COBRA rights, including how much it would cost to continue coverage. It doesn\u2019t come cheap. If you extend your current health coverage under COBRA, you\u2019ll pay your entire premium, including your employer\u2019s contribution, plus a 2 percent administrative charge. In all, your monthly bill could be several times the amount that used to come out of your paycheck.\n\nREAD MORE: How To Negotiate a High Medical Bill To a Manageable Level\n\nCOBRA or individual policy: Which is right for you?\n\nNo two situations are the same when it comes to health coverage. As such, there are several things you need to consider when deciding between an ACA plan and COBRA.\n\nRob DiMase, executive vice president of Sentinel Benefits & Financial Group in Wakefield, Massachusetts, suggests weighing these factors, in addition to a simple side-by-side rate comparison:\n\n1. Whether you qualify for a tax credit. Rates listed for plans on ACA marketplaces don\u2019t tell the entire story. About 87 percent of people buying such plans qualify for premium subsidies.\n\n2. Whether you\u2019ve met your current deductible. It might make sense to keep your employer plan for the rest of the year if you\u2019ve already met a hefty deductible and expect to incur more health care costs. You\u2019ll start from scratch on a new plan\u2019s deductible if you switch.\n\n3. When your COBRA rates might change. Group policies renew and change at different times. Know when your rates could increase and make sure to weigh this increase in your cost comparisons with ACA plans.\n\n4. Your age. Employer-based plans are group plans, in which rates are established based on you and all of your coworkers, many of whom could be older than you. Because insurers take your age into consideration when setting rates\u2014 just how much depends on your state\u2014 an individual plan could be cheaper than your employer coverage if you\u2019re young or much more expensive if you\u2019re older.\n\nREAD MORE: What You Should Know About the Premium Tax Credit\n\nDon\u2019t forget about your FSA or HSA\n\nYour insurance plan isn\u2019t the only health benefit you should consider when leaving your job.\n\nHealth savings accounts, or HSAs, follow you when you leave your job. Of course, your employer will no longer make contributions if they did before, and you\u2019ll only be able to contribute if you remain covered by a qualifying high deductible health plan, or HDHP. But you\u2019re not limited to your employer\u2019s HDHP\u2014 finding one on the marketplace works, too. Regardless, you can use the money already in your HSA for health care expenses.\n\nREAD MORE: What Can You Spend Your HSA Money On?\n\nThings are a little trickier if you have a flexible spending account, or FSA. Your employer funds these accounts with your entire annual election at the beginning of the year, and you reimburse them with your monthly contributions.\n\nIf you leave your job with money in your FSA, it doesn\u2019t come with you, meaning you lose contributions you haven\u2019t used. But FSAs are COBRA-eligible, and signing up unlocks your entire annual election, even those monthly contributions you haven\u2019t yet made, according to DiMase. Even if you only make one COBRA payment, you can use your entire annual election in that month.\n\nIn most cases, choosing a new plan from the individual marketplace makes sense for former employees. But you should still weigh your options carefully. Your age, medical needs and anticipated costs, and ability to pay premiums should all influence in your final decision.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/HEALTHY LIVING/Health Care", "dcterms.modified": "2015-08-08 06:01:15 EDT", "dcterms.abstract": "Joblessness\u2014 whether planned for or thrown in your lap without warning\u2014 feels a little like free-falling without a net.
