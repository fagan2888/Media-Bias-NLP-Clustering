Perry, who\u2019s on a multi-year national tour to help steal jobs away from other states for his home state of Texas, felt compelled to lecture Illinois about what it\u2019s doing wrong in keeping its fiscal house in order. The Trib balanced Perry\u2019s missive with a rebuttal by Illinois governor Pat Quinn.\n\nFor years, Perry has been gallivanting around the country, touting something he likes to call the \u201c Texas Miracle .\u201d It goes something like this: get government out of the way through lower taxes and less regulation, and corporations will celebrate by hiring new workers by the boatload.\n\nPerry points to his state\u2019s record of job growth as proof of the wisdom of his policies. In the Trib editorial, Perry says that over the past decade, Texas added more than 2 million jobs and grew jobs at a rate of 3.4 percent over the past year\u2014fastest among the biggest states in the country. By contrast, he points out Illinois lost 7,000 jobs in the same period.\n\nIt\u2019s a story Perry\u2019s been telling everywhere he goes. But take a closer look at his words, and it\u2019s clear Perry isn't only interested in job numbers as he lectures other states. What really concerns the three-term Republican is, well, basically Obamacare and social spending.\n\nIt\u2019s right there in the piece in today\u2019s Trib. Perry says that for a Texas Miracle to happen in Illinois, the state must \u201caccept that government should limit itself to core functions. When government takes over huge segments of the nation's economy, as the Obama administration has done through the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion, it's a recipe for disaster.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s right. Spending taxpayer dollars on taking care of the people in your state that need help is a \u201cdisaster.\u201d\n\nPerry goes on to say that spending on programs such as Medicaid expansion will \u201clead to higher costs for states already struggling to meet budget demands and will crowd out other essential government functions.\u201d\n\nWhat other \u201cessential government functions\u201d may be involved, Perry doesn't say. But you can rest assured those functions involve making sure corporations are given every advantage while the needy in Texas are given the short end of the stick.\n\nAfter all, it\u2019s no secret Texas leads the nation in the number of its citizens that don't have health insurance\u2014a fact directly related to Perry\u2019s decision to opt out of the Affordable Care Act for his state.\n\nAs well, 27 percent of Texas children were living in poverty in 2011, a rate that put the Lone Star State among the nine worst states in the country.\n\nOf course, the governor made sure Texas was first in line when it came to corporate welfare. Under Mr. Perry, Texas gives out more corporate incentives than any other state, around $19 billion a year.\n\nApparently, that all gives Rick Perry the authority to tell other governors how to run their states, even as he tries to steal their workers and companies with promises of lower taxes and a more \u201cfriendly\u201d business climate.\n\nIllinois may not be in the best fiscal health, but at least it\u2019s citizens aren't being shoved off a cliff simply so corporations can have an easier time to make a profit.\n\nThanks for your advice, Mr. Perry. But there\u2019s a reason why Illinois isn't like Texas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Texas governor Rick Perry has some advice for the state of Illinois: stop caring about your people so much.", "title": "Texas Guv to Illinois: Stop Reckless Spending on Social Programs", "og": {"site_name": "NBC Chicago", "description": "Texas governor Rick Perry has some advice for the state of Illinois: stop caring about your people so much.", "title": "Opinion: Perry's Wrong on Spending Critique", "url": "http://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/ward-room/Texas-Guv-to-Illinois-Stop-Reckless-Spending-on-Social-Programs-266441501.html", "image": "http://media.nbcchicago.com/images/1200*675/Perry+Border+Crisis+070314.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Texas governor Rick Perry has some advice for the state of Illinois: stop caring about your people so much.", "title": "Opinion: Perry's Wrong on Spending Critique", "url": "http://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/ward-room/Texas-Guv-to-Illinois-Stop-Reckless-Spending-on-Social-Programs-266441501.html", "image": "http://media.nbcchicago.com/images/1200*675/Perry+Border+Crisis+070314.jpg?ak=bc", "creator": "@ward_room", "site": "@ward_room", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 187516345314}, "keywords": "Rick Perry, Pat Quinn, Chicago, Texas, Illinois", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/nbcchicago"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Rick Perry, Pat Quinn, Chicago, Texas, Illinois"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1cd2\"", "article_summary": "Failed presidential candidate and current Texas governor Rick Perry has some advice for the state of Illinois: stop caring about your people so much.\nUnder Mr. Perry, Texas gives out more corporate incentives than any other state, around $19 billion a year.\nThe Trib balanced Perry\u2019s missive with a rebuttal by Illinois governor Pat Quinn.\nPerry says that for a Texas Miracle to happen in Illinois, the state must \u201caccept that government should limit itself to core functions.\nBut there\u2019s a reason why Illinois isn't like Texas."}
