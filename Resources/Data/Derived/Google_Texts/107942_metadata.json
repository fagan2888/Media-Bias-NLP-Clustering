The move came on top of other last-minute changes, such as a decision in July to delay the so-called employer mandate from 2014 to 2015, or after the midterm elections.\n\nMoody's said those changes have unsettled the marketplace.\n\n\u201cWhile all of these issues had been on our radar screen as we approached 2014, a new development and a key factor for the change in outlook is the unstable and evolving regulatory environment under which the sector is operating,\u201d Moody's said. \u201cNotably, new regulations and presidential announcements over the last several months with respect to the [Affordable Care Act] have imposed operational changes well after product and pricing decisions had been finalized.\u201d\n\nRepublicans opposed to the new national health care law seized on the report.\n\n\u201cMoody's latest downgrade is further evidence that the president\u2019s health law is not the right prescription for reform,\u201d said House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Rep. Fred Upton, Michigan Republican.\n\n\u201cHealth care should be about providing peace of mind, not generating costly rules and regulations that foster an environment of tremendous uncertainty and confusion.\u201d\n\nVice President Joseph R. Biden singled out \u201cpeace of mind\u201d as one of Obamacare\u2019s top advantages in a speech Thursday to health care advocates in Washington.\n\nHe said part of the White House\u2019s objective \u201cis not only to make sure you have adequate health care, it\u2019s to give people peace of mind, for a mom or a dad to be able to turn around and say with confidence when they look in their child\u2019s eye when they\u2019re sick and say, \u2018Honey, it\u2019s going to be OK.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut doubts about the law linger, even as Moody's survey noted.\n\n\u201cIn 2015, insurers will need to deal with the implications of the employer mandate and the second year of the individual mandate,\u201d Moody's said. \u201cBoth require substantial lead time with respect to product development and pricing. Ad hoc changes to these provisions, as experienced at the end of 2013, would add additional risks and financial uncertainty.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The nation\u2019s health insurers have been damaged by the shaky Obamacare rollout, a top credit-rating agency said as it downgraded the industry\u2019s outlook Thursday \u2014 even as new numbers suggested President Obama\u2019s health law is showing some successes.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The nation\u2019s health insurers have been damaged by the shaky Obamacare rollout, a top credit-rating agency said as it downgraded the industry\u2019s outlook Thursday \u2014 even as new numbers suggested President Obama\u2019s health law is showing some successes.", "title": "Moody\u2019s downgrades health insurers, citing Obamacare", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/23/moodys-downgrades-health-insurers-citing-obamacare/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/11/10/11102013_ap4509584008838201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/11/10/11102013_ap4509584008838201.jpg", "description": "The nation\u2019s health insurers have been damaged by the shaky Obamacare rollout, a top credit-rating agency said as it downgraded the industry\u2019s outlook Thursday \u2014 even as new numbers suggested Presiden", "card": "summary", "title": "Moody\u2019s downgrades health insurers, citing Obamacare"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Moody Investors Service, White House"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8e4d\"", "article_summary": "But excitement over the numbers was dampened by Moody's, which downgraded its outlook for U.S. health care insurers from \u201cstable\u201d to \u201cnegative,\u201d citing uncertainty stemming from Obamacare.\nThe nation\u2019s health insurers have been damaged by the shaky Obamacare rollout, a top credit-rating agency said as it downgraded the industry\u2019s outlook Thursday \u2014 even as new numbers suggested President Obama\u2019s health law is showing some successes.\n\u201cIn 2015, insurers will need to deal with the implications of the employer mandate and the second year of the individual mandate,\u201d Moody's said.\n\u201cMoody's latest downgrade is further evidence that the president\u2019s health law is not the right prescription for reform,\u201d said House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Rep.
