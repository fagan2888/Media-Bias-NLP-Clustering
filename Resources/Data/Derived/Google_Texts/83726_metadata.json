But you don\u2019t have to take my word for it. If you talk to somebody who says, well, I don\u2019t know, I was watching FOX News and they said this was horrible \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 you can say, you know what, don\u2019t take my word for it, go on the website. See for yourself what the prices are. See for yourself what the choices are. Then make up your own mind. That\u2019s all I\u2019m asking. Make up your own mind. I promise you, if you go on the website and it turns out you\u2019re going to save $100, $200, $300 a month on your insurance, or you\u2019ll be able to buy insurance for the first time, even if you didn\u2019t vote for me \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 I\u2019ll bet you\u2019ll sign up for that health care plan.\n\nIn response, Fox News exec Neil Cavuto did the verbal equivalent of throwing up on himself:\n\nCavuto:\n\nMr. President, tell that to tens of thousands of retirees at IBM and Time Warner and dozens of others, who\u2019ve been dumped from their coverage and told to find their own coverage. Fox News didn\u2019t break that news to them, Mr. President. Their companies did. Fox News didn\u2019t push more of those firms to hire part-time workers. Your healthcare law did. Fox News didn\u2019t incentivize fast food restaurants to scale back their benefits. Your healthcare law did. Fox News didn\u2019t make doctors want to opt out. Your healthcare law did. Fox News didn\u2019t make insurance premiums sky rocket. Your healthcare law did. Just like Fox News didn\u2019t grant hundreds of exemptions to companies that needed them. You did. And Fox News didn\u2019t delay one key provision after another, including online enrollment for those small business exchanges. You did. Just like it wasn\u2019t Fox News that said we had to pass this to see what was in this. You did. Or was that Nancy Pelosi? Sometimes I\u2019m confused. But of this I am not. Fox News didn\u2019t re-do basic math. Sir, you did. Fox News didn\u2019t say you can cover 30 million more Americans and not see a hit in premiums. You did. Fox News didn\u2019t say you could throw in those with pre-existing conditions and not have to pay for it. You did. Fox News didn\u2019t all but say you could get something for nothing. You did. Fox News didn\u2019t come back years later and say, oh yea, we did raise some taxes. You did. Here\u2019s where you are right about Fox News, however, Mr. President. We can do math. And did. You cannot. And did not. We said it, and proved it. You didn\u2019t. And we\u2019re all suffering for it. Take it from the numbers guy at Fox. Numbers don\u2019t lie. The number of Americans working part-time and nervous. The number of retirees days away from being dumped on exchanges and anxious. The number of company bosses with any news to pass along on those exchanges, but still clueless. The number of doctors who want out. The number of congressmen now opting out. No, Mr. President, none of those numbers lie. But with all due respect sir, I can only conclude you do know; I know you hate us at Fox. But please take a look in a mirror, and fast. You think we\u2019re the skunk at your picnic. But that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re the ones that stink. Because that smell isn\u2019t coming from the folks reporting on your law. Mr. President, that smell is your law.\n\nCavuto is the numbers guy at Fox News, in the same way that Paul Ryan is the numbers guy in the Republican Party. They\u2019re both clueless. There were three things missing from Cavuto\u2019s little rant. 1). Facts 2). Data 3). Truth.\n\nNeil Cavuto didn\u2019t get to be an executive at Fox News by not knowing the style. Cavuto sounded tough. He sounded like he was taking on the president, but he was lying. His words were empty. He had no data to back up his claims. Everything he said was a Republican talking point, and absolutely none of it can be proven with facts. Fox News embarrassed itself, and demonstrated how weak the argument against the ACA has become.\n\nAs the data comes in, these bogus claims are falling apart. In their response, Fox News proved Obama right. These critics have nothing but distorted talking points and empty scare tactics on their side.\n\nThe only thing that smells here is the BS that is another Fox News fail.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In response to President Obama calling out their ACA lies, Fox News responded by proving the president right in the most humiliating way possible.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "In response to President Obama calling out their ACA lies, Fox News responded by proving the president right in the most humiliating way possible.", "title": "Fox News Humiliates Itself Trying to Respond To Obama Calling Out Their ACA Lies", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2013/09/26/fox-news-humiliates-respond-obamas-calling-aca-lies.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/obama-punch.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-09-26T19:46:53+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,cavuto obama,neil cavuto fox news obamacare lies,neil cavuto obama,obama aca fox news lies,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2013-09-26T19:46:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-26T19:46:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "cavuto obama, neil cavuto fox news obamacare lies, neil cavuto obama, obama aca fox news lies"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0080\"", "article_summary": "In response to President Obama calling out their ACA lies, Fox News responded by proving the president right in the most humiliating way possible.\nFox News didn\u2019t say you could throw in those with pre-existing conditions and not have to pay for it.\nFox News didn\u2019t say you can cover 30 million more Americans and not see a hit in premiums.\nFox News didn\u2019t break that news to them, Mr. President.\nHere\u2019s where you are right about Fox News, however, Mr. President."}
