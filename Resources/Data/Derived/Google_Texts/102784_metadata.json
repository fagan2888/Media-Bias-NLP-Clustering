(Fellas, bear with me here.)\n\nYou\u2019re thinking you\u2019d like to breastfeed your new bundle of joy. You\u2019re sure. Pretty sure. But how to work and nurse?\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, you\u2019ll get some help figuring that out. (Plus a free breast pump for just that purpose.)\n\nIf you\u2019re not pregnant and don\u2019t want to be, insurance companies will pay for your birth control under the ACA. If you have little ones, you\u2019ll have access to dental and vision care for them.\n\nHaven\u2019t heard about all that? You aren\u2019t alone.\n\nA lot of attention has been paid to the big parts of the ACA \u2014 the fact that large businesses will have to provide health insurance to workers, that almost all Americans will have to have health insurance or pay a penalty, and that the federal government will help some people pay for insurance. But the ACA is 900-plus pages long, with regulations that take up thousands of pages more.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to miss things.\n\nThings like these.\n\nBreast pumps for all!\n\nAll ACA-compliant health insurance plans must provide breastfeeding support, counseling and equipment. Help may be provided before the baby\u2019s born; it must be provided for the duration of breastfeeding.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean your insurance company has to hand over a new, $1,000 hospital-grade breast pump. Pumps can be manual or electric, used and rented or new and yours to keep. That depends on your insurance plan.\n\nAlso dependent on your plan: Whether your doctor must sign off on it. Some insurance companies require preauthorization. Talk to your doctor or insurance company to find out more.\n\nBut let\u2019s say your doctor\u2019s on board, your insurance company has handed over the Cadillac of breast pumps (or maybe the Ford of breast pumps) and little Juniper is happily taking a bottle with Daddy, at Grandma\u2019s or in day care.\n\nHow are you supposed to find time for all this pumping while you work? The ACA also requires many employers to provide reasonable break time \u2014 and a private location other than a bathroom \u2014 for pumping.\n\nThere are exceptions. For example, companies with fewer than 50 employees don\u2019t have to comply if they prove such a break would impose an \u201cundue hardship\u201d on them. And the company doesn\u2019t have to pay you for the time unless you\u2019re pumping during a break that would be paid for other employees.\n\nBut if your employer fits the requirement, these accommodations must be made for as long as you are breastfeeding, for up to a year after the baby\u2019s birth.\n\nBirth control\n\nIf you have an ACA-compliant health plan \u2014 generally, any full health insurance bought after March 2010 (see below) \u2014 the insurance company must pay for prescribed contraceptives, patient education and birth control counseling.\n\nYou may have heard something about this; it\u2019s been pretty controversial. But even though some people have tried to get it removed from the ACA, it\u2019s still there for the moment and still law.\n\nThe caveats: You have to be a woman to get this benefit. Certain religious employers don\u2019t have to offer it to their employees. And the contraceptives have to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nWhat kind of birth control does this include? Barrier methods, such as diaphragms and sponges. Hormonal methods, such as birth control pills and vaginal rings. Implanted devices, such as intrauterine devices, or IUDs. Emergency contraception, such as \u201cPlan B.\u201d Sterilization procedures.\n\nYour insurance company doesn\u2019t have to provide any and all birth control for free, just a selection from each category. However, it does have to give you a specific contraceptive if your doctor says you need that one.\n\nInsurance companies aren\u2019t required to cover drugs to induce abortion or services related to a man\u2019s, er, reproductive ability. Such as vasectomies. (Sorry, guys.)\n\nThe birth control part of the ACA has been challenged by a number of religious groups and employers who don\u2019t want to provide contraceptives. The U.S. Supreme Court is likely to take up the issue soon. But, for now, the rule stands.\n\nDental and vision for kids\n\nTo the ACA, dental and vision care are an essential part of children\u2019s health care the same way ER visits, medications and blood tests are.\n\nThat means they must be available to kids as part of your insurance plan or alone as a free-standing plan. (This isn\u2019t true for grown-ups. Insurers don\u2019t have to offer dental and vision care to you.)\n\nIn Maine, all health plans in the marketplace include vision care, but most don\u2019t include dental. Standalone dental plans will likely be offered in the marketplace by Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield and Delta Dental, with rates ranging from about $26 a month to about $39 a month, according to the Maine Bureau of Insurance. All plans cap your out-of-pocket expenses at $700 a year for one child and $1,400 a year for two children or more.\n\nOff the marketplace, according to the bureau, a variety of insurers will offer dental plans, with rates ranging from about $26 a month to about $50 a month, depending on whether you\u2019re buying for your family only or through a small group, such as your employer.\n\nFYI: Dental and vision have to be offered for kids, but you don\u2019t have to take them. If dental or vision are not part of your insurance plan, the ACA won\u2019t make you buy a standalone policy to get them.\n\nCoverage counts\n\nStarting Jan. 1, 2014, most Americans will have to have health insurance or pay a penalty.\n\nBut you can\u2019t just go buy a $50 plan from a sketchy Internet site and call it good. (Not that you would.)\n\nUnder the ACA, insurance plans have to limit patient costs and provide essential coverage. Think hospitalization, doctor\u2019s visits, lab tests and preventive care.\n\nSure, that sounds like most health insurance, so what doesn\u2019t count? Plans that cover only vision or dental care. Workers\u2019 compensation. Coverage only for a specific disease or condition. Plans that offer only discounts on medical services.\n\nIf you or your employer bought health insurance before the law was signed on March 23, 2010, you may be able to keep it. That\u2019s called a grandfathered plan.\n\nBut be careful. If there\u2019s a significant change that reduces the plan\u2019s benefits or raises patient costs \u2014 such as if you ask to increase your deductible \u2014 that grandfathered status could vanish. (Check out our story today on preventive care for more on that.)\n\nPercentage rules\n\nLet\u2019s say you can get insurance through work, but it\u2019s expensive. Life would really be so much sweeter if you could buy it on your own through the marketplace and get a subsidy from the feds to help.\n\nYou can.\n\nBut.\n\nThe ACA also has something called a 9.5 percent rule.\n\nThe feds say employer insurance is unaffordable if it\u2019ll cost you more than 9.5 percent of your family income to insure you. Unaffordable work insurance means you might qualify for a subsidy to go to the marketplace and buy insurance on your own.\n\nThe key words there: \u201cfamily income\u201d and \u201cinsure YOU.\u201d There\u2019s the rub.\n\nThe 9.5 percent is based on family income, but your employer only has to insure you. Not your spouse. Not your children. So as long as you pay less than 9.5 percent of your family income for your own insurance \u2014 even if you have to pay more to add your kids to the policy \u2014 you don\u2019t qualify for a subsidy.\n\nStarting in 2015, the feds will penalize large employers who offer unaffordable insurance, so companies will ultimately have an incentive to provide you with coverage you can afford. But the 9.5 percent rule applies to that, too.\n\nAs long as the company offers ACA-compliant insurance that costs less than 9.5 percent of your family income to insure just you, they\u2019re penalty-free.\n\nIt\u2019s a loophole that has experts worried that companies will pull back on dependent coverage and sink that money into employee-only coverage. Only time will tell what employers will do and whether that loophole will be closed.\n\nWonder about your situation? Ask your employer about coverage for next year and check the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s online calculator for more information on subsidies and premium estimates.\n\nStill concerned about cost? You and your family may be able to get an exemption to the insurance requirement if your household earns less than the poverty level in Maine (because Maine didn\u2019t expand Medicaid) or if your family income is so small that you don\u2019t have to file taxes. You may also be able to get an exemption if you can show it would be a hardship for you to get insurance.", "article_metadata": {"description": "So, let\u2019s say you\u2019re pregnant.
