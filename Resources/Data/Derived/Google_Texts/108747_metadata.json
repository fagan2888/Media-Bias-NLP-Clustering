(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\n3926699\n\nObama administration Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius\u2019 failure at designing websites to provide government services began during her term as governor of Kansas, long before the Obamacare website debacle, Kansas political insiders told The Daily Caller.\n\nSebelius oversaw numerous costly and disastrous government website projects during her six-year governorship (2003-2009), including a failed update of the Department of Labor\u2019s program to provide unemployment pay and other services and similar updates pertaining to the Department of Administration and the state\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) services.\n\nThe Department of Labor\u2019s overhaul of its computer programs was a notable boondoggle, according to 14-year former Kansas state senator and former state Labor Secretary Karin Brownlee.\n\n\u201cIn the Kansas Senate, I chaired the Commerce committee. We had oversight over the Department of Labor. For years, we watched as the Department of Labor under Sebelius worked on that computer program. After seven years and $50 million, something should work,\u201d Brownlee told TheDC.\n\n\u201cIn Kansas if you have a 40 or 50 million dollar project, that\u2019s a lot of money,\u201d Brownlee said, noting that the Labor Department project was funded by federal money while other Sebelius website projects sucked up state taxpayer dollars. \u201cThey started and stopped that project with at least 3 different major contractors.\u201d\n\nWhen Brownlee was appointed to head the state\u2019s Department of Labor under new Republican governor Sam Brownback in 2011, she was tasked with cleaning up Sebelius\u2019 technical mess.\n\n\u201cWhen I walked in the door at Labor [the computer update] was half-done. There were about 240 errors in work-around. It was not functional,\u201d Brownlee said.\n\n\u201cThe agency was spending more than $1 million per month on contractors and other things. So as soon as we found out how much was going out per month we had to shut that down. That wasn\u2019t workable,\u201d Brownlee said. \u201cIn the private sector, that would never be acceptable.\u201d (RELATED: GOP senator to Sebelius: RESIGN)\n\n\u201cThe computer [program update] was supposed to help deliver unemployment insurance benefits, which is critical, obviously, during a recession, because unemployment was much higher at the time. But the agency kept hiring more people because the computer system didn\u2019t work. The Obama administration provided the money to fund it, and the money ended when I got there so we had to downsize considerably,\u201d Brownlee said. \u201cI brought in a consultant who fixed everything so that what we had was somewhat usable.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo Brownback, it was important to him that things worked. The point of a computer system is not to have one in and of itself. It\u2019s to facilitate services for constituents. And that\u2019s impossible when the system doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Brownlee said.\n\nSebelius\u2019 other government website projects, funded with state taxpayer money, also created considerable headaches.\n\n\u201cUnder Sebelius there were a number of computer projects. At the Department of Administration, there was a SMART system for [tracking] financial data about agencies and a system for HR information. The performance on it was extremely poor. The Department of Revenue re-did their DMV programs. That started under Sebelius,\u201d Brownlee said, adding that Brownback was \u201csaddled with that [DMV] contract\u201d when he took office.\n\nKansas constituents were left waiting days to obtain DMV services.\n\n\u201cIn government, these computer transactions are a black hole for tens of millions of dollars,\u201d Brownlee said. \u201cPeople worked around it and worked the other way pretty much. I don\u2019t know that [Sebelius] was ever personally held responsible for any of this\u2026when you\u2019re trying to serve your citizens somebody has to be responsible.\u201d\n\nOther lawmakers acknowledged the failures of Sebelius\u2019 tech projects.\n\n\u201cWe heard several excuses for IT failures under Sebelius. Especially towards the end of her administration. The legislature was often frustrated with the Labor Department, Department of Administration, and also Pharmacy claims. It was hard to get clear answers back then too,\u201d Kansas state Rep. Scott Schwab told The Daily Caller.\n\n\u201cWe pretty much expected HealthCare.gov to fail, because she has a pattern of failing on these big initiatives. We thought that was why she was not nominated originally,\u201d Schwab said.\n\nWhether or not President Obama knew about Sebelius\u2019 website track record when he put her in charge of overseeing the Obamacare website remains unclear.\n\n\u201cWhen you consider that Obamacare is the pinnacle of president Obama\u2019s presidential career, why would he not have been informed?,\u201d Brownlee said. \u201cWhy is it that the private sector can do these projects and do them in a timely way and they work and government can\u2019t?\u201d\n\nThe White House and the Department of Health and Human Services did not return requests for comment.\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "Kathleen Sebelius' failure at designing websites began during her term as governor of Kansas, long before the Obamacare website debacle", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Obama administration Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius' failure at designing websites to provide government services began during her term as governor of Kansas, long before the Ob", "title": "Lawmakers: Sebelius failed at government website projects prior to serving in Obama administration", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/10/23/lawmakers-sebelius-failed-at-government-website-projects-prior-to-serving-in-obama-administration/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Sebelius-104545673-e1331572397125.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'A pattern of failing'", "title": "Lawmakers: Sebelius failed at government website projects prior to serving in Obama administration Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/10/23/lawmakers-sebelius-failed-at-government-website-projects-prior-to-serving-in-obama-administration/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Sebelius-104545673-e1331572397125.jpg"}, "creator": "@patrickhowleydc", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-23 23:04:08", "sailthru.title": "Lawmakers: Sebelius failed at government website projects prior to serving in Obama administration", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "obamacare,patrick-howley", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "kathleen sebelius,health and human services,obamacare,obamacare website,,kansas", "sailthru.description": "Obama administration Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius' failure at designing websites to provide government services began during her term as governor of Kansas, long before the Ob", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Sebelius-104545673-e1331572397125.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd262f\"", "article_summary": "Whether or not President Obama knew about Sebelius\u2019 website track record when he put her in charge of overseeing the Obamacare website remains unclear.\nThat started under Sebelius,\u201d Brownlee said, adding that Brownback was \u201csaddled with that [DMV] contract\u201d when he took office.\nThe legislature was often frustrated with the Labor Department, Department of Administration, and also Pharmacy claims.\nSebelius\u2019 other government website projects, funded with state taxpayer money, also created considerable headaches.\nThe point of a computer system is not to have one in and of itself."}
