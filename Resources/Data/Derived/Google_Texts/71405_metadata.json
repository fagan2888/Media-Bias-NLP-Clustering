Not the old, bumbling Rick Perry who amused us endlessly with his serial gaffes and horrifically cold-blooded attitude towards capital punishment, but the new, glasses-wearing Rick Perry who\u2019s on the comeback trail and still has a horrifically cold-blooded attitude towards capital punishment. And when you\u2019re running for president, you release advertisements like the one Rick Perry\u2019s PAC \u2013 cleverly called Rick PAC \u2013 just put out touting Perry\u2019s stunning success at keeping terrorists from invading our country through Mexico.\n\n\u201cGang members and terrorists are reportedly using the border crisis as a free pass to set up shop in the United States,\u201d a Fox Business anchor intones with startling gravity before the ad quick-cuts to the various things Rick Perry has done to defend the country from the reported terrorists, like ordering 1,000 National Guard troops to the border and fondling a large gun with Sean Hannity. The first of the National Guard troops arrived at the border only yesterday, so Perry quite sensibly took a victory lap for an operation that is literally less than a day old.\n\nSince Perry is quite obviously running for president, we can take this ad as an indication of how the immigration debate will play out in the Republicans primaries. If this is the starting point \u2013 Lock down the border! Terrorists! Criminal gangs! \u2013 it\u2019s looking like it\u2019ll be very ugly. Perry\u2019s ad is also the latest indicator of just how far the GOP has backslid on immigration as an issue.\n\nWhat people recall most about Perry\u2019s awful 2012 campaign is the gaffes \u2013 \u201coops,\u201d the bizarre speech he gave in New Hampshire, the War on Christmas ad. But part of what got Perry in such deep trouble with Republican primary voters was his stance on immigration, which was to the left of the rest of the primary field.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Perry brags that he's protecting us from terrorists at the border, and leads the 2016 GOP into demographic oblivion VIDEO", "author": "Simon Maloy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Perry brags that he's protecting us from terrorists at the border, and leads the 2016 GOP into demographic oblivion VIDEO", "title": "Rick Perry gets gross: New right-wing lurch invokes terrorists and immigrants", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/15/rick_perry_gets_gross_new_right_wing_lurch_invokes_terrorists_and_immigrants/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/rick_perry5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Perry brags that he's protecting us from terrorists at the border, and leads the 2016 GOP into demographic oblivion VIDEO", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/rick_perry5.jpg", "title": "Rick Perry gets gross: New right-wing lurch invokes terrorists and immigrants", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Rick Perry gets gross: New right-wing lurch invokes terrorists and immigrants", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, 2016 presidential race, Border Security, Immigration, Immigration Reform, Republican Party, Rick PAC, Rick Perry, Terrorism, Texas, U.S.-Mexico border, Undocumented immigrants, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddae3\"", "article_summary": "Not the old, bumbling Rick Perry who amused us endlessly with his serial gaffes and horrifically cold-blooded attitude towards capital punishment, but the new, glasses-wearing Rick Perry who\u2019s on the comeback trail and still has a horrifically cold-blooded attitude towards capital punishment.\nTopics: 2016 Elections, 2016 presidential race, Border Security, Immigration, Immigration Reform, Republican Party, Rick PAC, Rick Perry, Terrorism, Texas, U.S.-Mexico border, Undocumented immigrants, Video, Politics NewsRick Perry is pretty clearly running for president.\nAnd when you\u2019re running for president, you release advertisements like the one Rick Perry\u2019s PAC \u2013 cleverly called Rick PAC \u2013 just put out touting Perry\u2019s stunning success at keeping terrorists from invading our country through Mexico.\nPerry\u2019s ad is also the latest indicator of just how far the GOP has backslid on immigration as an issue.\nTerrorists!"}
