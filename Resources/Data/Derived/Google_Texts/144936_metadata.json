Scott Walker, an angry rant that leaves no hyperbolic accusation unstated as he tells the presidential candidate: \u201cF\u2013 you.\u201d\n\nThe tirade, posted earlier this week on Huffington Post, was written by Tim Koechlin, a senior lecturer and director of international studies at the private liberal arts college in New York.\n\nThe piece centers around Koechlin\u2019s angst for receiving campaign e-mails from Walker seeking contributions. Koechlin\u2019s emailed reply begins: \u201cF\u2013 you.\u201d\n\nKoechlin went on to describe his online engagement with Walker\u2019s campaign and his overall disgust for the man, lambasting the candidate for \u201ctax cuts for the 1 percent, deregulation and relentless attacks on working people and the unions that advocate for them.\u201d\n\nHe charged Walker with \u201cpandering to the worst impulses of right wing voters\u201d and pledged to do \u201cwhatever I can to make sure you will not become president.\u201d\n\nKoechlin also accused the governor of racism and actively working to hurt the poor and people of color, noting \u201cWalker has shamelessly adopted the right-wing\u2019s racist play book, at every opportunity, blaming the low pay, insecurity and anxiety of white working class people on \u2018undeserving\u2019 people of color \u2013 \u2018welfare\u2019 recipients,** \u2018illegal\u2019 immigrants, Muslims and, of course, President Obama.\u201d\n\n\u201cApparently, from Scott Walker\u2019s point of view, the problem with the U.S. is that corporations and the super-rich are getting too little, while people of color, workers, teachers, students, the elderly, and the poor are getting too much!\u201d\n\nLeaving no stone unturned, he also stated Walker has \u201cattacked\u201d education and \u201cgutted\u201d the University of Wisconsin system, bemoaned the politician\u2019s criticisms of Obamacare, accused the presidential candidate of being a puppet of the Koch brothers, griped about the politician\u2019s fight against the EPA, and suggested he holds disdain for \u201cmost Americans.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s just the highlight reel.\n\nThe College Fix reached out to Koechlin, asking him in emails if he considered his classroom lectures unbiased in the wake of such ardently held views. He did not respond.\n\nWalker\u2019s campaign also did not return requests for comments.\n\nKoechlin is slated to teach \u201cIntro to Urban Studies\u201d this fall as Vassar, according to the online schedule.\n\n\u201cBefore arriving at Vassar in 2001, Tim taught economics at Smith College and Skidmore College, where he was a tenured member of the economics department,\u201d his faculty profile states.\n\nKoechlin is no stranger to touting leftist views.\n\nIn a previous Huffington Post column \u201cWhy I Will Vote for the Democrats,\u201d Koechlin wrote \u201cI believe that racism, sexism and homophobia are widespread, and bad for all of us. And I believe that many Americans are in denial about this.\u201d\n\nHis personal contribution to \u2018Vassar College\u2019s Privilege Campaign\u2019 in 2013 stated in part: \u201cI am a highly educated, prosperous, straight, white man. I always get the benefit of the doubt.\u201d\n\nHe has also written a satirical article essentially arguing \u201cStand Your Ground\u201d laws are racist and only help white people.\n\n\u201cThis law will simply allow a Normal American to respond with force if they encounter a truly threatening person: an urban gang-type person; a hostile seeming Muslim type person, or maybe a predatory-looking homosexual,\u201d he stated.\n\nLike The College Fix on Facebook / Follow us on Twitter\n\nIMAGE: YouTube screenshot", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The College Fix", "description": "Vassar scholar figuratively froths with anger and vitriol over Republican politician.", "title": "Professor pens massive tirade against Scott Walker, tells governor: \u2018F- you\u2019 - The College Fix", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 580, "identifier": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ScottWalkerYouTube.jpg", "height": 380}, "updated_time": "2015-07-23T00:40:06-04:00", "url": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/23465/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ScottWalkerYouTube.jpg", "description": "Vassar scholar figuratively froths with anger and vitriol over Republican politician.", "card": "summary", "title": "Professor pens massive tirade against Scott Walker, tells governor: \u2018F- you\u2019 - The College Fix"}, "fb": {"admins": "672627547,1540010264,100009162449428", "app_id": 1559699120988871}, "article": {"section": "Featured", "tag": "Vassar College", "published_time": "2015-07-23T00:34:55-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-23T00:40:06-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Vassar scholar figuratively froths with anger and vitriol over Republican politicianA professor at Vassar College has penned a lengthy screed against Republican Gov.\nThe piece centers around Koechlin\u2019s angst for receiving campaign e-mails from Walker seeking contributions.\nKoechlin is slated to teach \u201cIntro to Urban Studies\u201d this fall as Vassar, according to the online schedule.\nThe College Fix reached out to Koechlin, asking him in emails if he considered his classroom lectures unbiased in the wake of such ardently held views.\nLike The College Fix on Facebook / Follow us on TwitterIMAGE: YouTube screenshot"}
