Cory Gardner\u2019s legislation aimed at making certain forms of birth control available over the counter was met with criticism and skepticism by several groups, including NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado.\n\nThe Republican rookie \u2014 who on the campaign trail last year talked about making the pill available without a prescription \u2014 on Thursday announced he was sponsoring the Allowing Greater Access to Safe and Effective Contraception Act with Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H.\n\nAlthough the text of the bill hasn\u2019t been posted online yet, various groups are already claiming what the bill will do \u2014 claims that could be called into question once the fine print is known.\n\nThe criticism:\n\nCathy Alderman, Planned Parenthood Votes Colorado\n\nU.S. Senator Cory Gardner\u2019s proposal to make oral contraception \u201cover the counter\u201d is an insult \u2013 making it more expensive and less available. By making the pill available without prescription, insurance coverage that makes it available without a co-pay would be eliminated. Women would pay up to $600 a year for birth control pills and still have to pay their insurance premiums \u2013 double billing for eliminating their coverage. Senator Gardner pretends he is expanding access to birth control when in reality he doesn\u2019t make birth control more affordable, doesn\u2019t expand the availability of IUDs and other effective methods. He has joined other Senators who have long histories of opposing access to contraception in trying to pass sham legislation. Planned Parenthood supports making birth control more affordable and accessible to all women. This proposal doesn\u2019t even come close to that goal.\n\nDr. Mark S. DeFrancesco, president of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)\n\nAccess to contraception is essential for women\u2019s health, and evidence has repeatedly proven that oral contraceptives are safe for use over the counter. However, while we applaud Senators Gardner, Ayotte, Heller, Ernst, Burr, Johnson and Tillis for their recognition of this, their bill does not do much to increase access to contraception \u2014 and, in fact, includes details that will take a giant step in the wrong direction. The Affordable Care Act removed many barriers to preventive care that keeps women healthy. By making contraceptives available to women without a co-pay, it has truly increased access to contraception, thereby decreasing unintended pregnancies, and allowing women to better plan their futures. Unfortunately, instead of improving access, this bill would actually make more women have to pay for their birth control, and for some women, the cost would be prohibitive. As women\u2019s health care providers, we welcome robust and productive dialogue about the indisputable role that contraceptives play in the health, well-being, and productivity of American women. We would welcome any legislation that would do what this proposal purports to do \u2014 help women. As it stands, however, we cannot support a plan that creates one route to access at the expense of another, more helpful route.\n\nKaren Middleton, NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado\n\nAs we saw throughout his career and campaign \u2014 when he denied a \u2018personhood\u2019 bill he cosponsored even existed \u2014 Cory Gardner can\u2019t be trusted when it comes to Colorado women and their health care. With this legislation, he\u2019s trying to limit women\u2019s access to contraception by undermining the Affordable Care Act and double-billing them, first for insurance then for full retail cost of their birth control. This adds up to hundreds, even thousands, of dollars many women don\u2019t have in their budget \u2014 and if birth control isn\u2019t affordable, it isn\u2019t accessible. If Gardner was serious about ensuring access to birth control, he\u2019s stop supporting anti-choice bills and get behind the Affordable Care Act to ensure all women can choose and AFFORD the birth control that\u2019s best for them.\n\nIlyse Hogue, NARAL Pro-Choice America\n\nThe Gardner/Ayotte bill is a specifically designed to deceive voters into thinking these anti-choice legislators are on the side of women, when their track records tell a starkly different story. This legislation hurts women by making affordable birth control less accessible while forcing women to pay twice for the same services. This effort is nothing but political pandering to trick women and families into thinking we are covered while dismantling one of the most critical gains in the Affordable Care Act. Senators Gardner and Ayotte know they are imposing a tax on women for critical health care, and if they thought that we wouldn\u2019t notice, they were sorely mistaken. Instead of hiding from the anti-choice views, they should own them and let the voters decide. Women in this country know what family planning options work best for us and we deserve to have access to a wide range of birth control without paying extra.\n\nGardner\u2019s bill would encourage drug manufacturers of \u201croutine-use contraceptives\u201d to file an application with the FDA to sell their products over the counter. Their bill also would repeal the Affordable Care Act\u2019s restriction on the use of health, medical and flexible savings accounts to purchase over-the-counter drugs without a prescription.", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "U.S. Sen.
