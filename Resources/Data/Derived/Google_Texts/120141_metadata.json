His two daughters, Taelor and Sydni, posted a video and a letter in tribute to their dad, to mark the one-year anniversary of his passing.\n\n\u201cThis last year, we realized the full impact you\u2019ve had on the world, and how important you were to so many,\u201d they wrote on their blog at Dear World. \u201cWe are truly grateful for the opportunity to meet many people whom you profoundly impacted, share our grief and our memories while giving back on your behalf and continuing the legacy you started in raising cancer awareness.\u201d\n\nIn the video, both Taelor and Syndi recount how their father influenced their lives individually, with Scott always being there to watch Taelor play soccer, or teaching Sydni how to operate a camera she\u2019d received as a gift. Sydni recounts how she used the camera to take pictures of her father in the hospital.\n\n\u201cIt was like back when I was little,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was the best time we got to spend together in years.\u201d\n\nHis daughters finish their letter by stating how they have learned to persevere through it all, just like their father did. \u201c[W]e\u2019ve learned to reach for the fight we possess inside and apply it with passion to our lives. It was through your vulnerability, that you taught us the real value of strength in never giving up.\u201d\n\nBefore passing away at 49, Scott accepted the Jimmy V Perseverance Award at the 2014 ESPYs. \u201cWhen you die, it does not mean that you lose to cancer,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cYou beat cancer by how you live, why you live, and in the manner in which you live.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "espn, anchor, stuart, scotts, daughters, taelor, and, syndi, pay, touching, tribute, their, dad", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "ESPN anchor Stuart Scott's daughters posted a touching tribute to him a year after his death.", "title": "Stuart Scott's Daughters Remember Their Dad In Touching Video Tribute", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/espn-anchor-stuart-scotts-daughters-taelor-and-syndi-pay-touching-tribute-their-dad-367856", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2016/01/04/stuart-scott.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "ESPN anchor Stuart Scott's daughters posted a touching tribute to him a year after his death.", "title": "Stuart Scott's Daughters Remember Their Dad In Touching Video Tribute", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/espn-anchor-stuart-scotts-daughters-taelor-and-syndi-pay-touching-tribute-their-dad-367856", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2016/01/04/stuart-scott.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/01/04/stuart-scott.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2016-01-04T18:46:07-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-04T18:46:05-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "ESPN anchor Stuart Scott's daughters posted a touching tribute to him a year after his death."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcc5f\"", "article_summary": "His two daughters, Taelor and Sydni, posted a video and a letter in tribute to their dad, to mark the one-year anniversary of his passing.\nLong-time ESPN anchor Stuart Scott had a well-documented battle with cancer, which he succumbed to last year.\n\u201cYou beat cancer by how you live, why you live, and in the manner in which you live.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you die, it does not mean that you lose to cancer,\u201d he said at the time.\n\u201c[W]e\u2019ve learned to reach for the fight we possess inside and apply it with passion to our lives."}
