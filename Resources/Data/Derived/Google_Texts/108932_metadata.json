Mistakes will be addressed. If crimes are committed, they will be prosecuted. Or at least investigated by law enforcement.\n\nBut that\u2019s not always what happens.\n\nTake the case of Stacey Siriani of San Diego County. Her experience with assisted living began four years ago when she got an awful phone call from Houston. Her father was involved in an auto accident that left him brain damaged.\n\n\u201cIt was very tough,\u201d she recalls. Siriani is an only child; her father is a widower. There was nowhere else to turn for support.\n\nFirst, her father spent some time in a Texas hospital trauma unit, and then in rehab. After that, Siriani moved her dad to California, into an assisted living facility so close to her home in Carlsbad that she could visit two or three times a day.\n\nJust as important, it had a memory care unit, meaning extra supervision \u2014 and locked doors to block wandering residents. She\u2019d spied the facility driving past, and really, that was the extent of her research. That, and a tour.\n\n\u201cAt that time, I didn\u2019t know what citations were,\u201d she says. \u201cI just went off the marketing lady that takes you on the tour and promises you the world, just like they do everybody else.\u201d\n\nHer dad didn\u2019t qualify for public assistance, so this cost him about $3,300 a month, out of pocket.\n\nA few months later, Siriani got another awful phone call. A staff member from the facility said her father had fallen and cut his chin. That turned out to be an understatement, as the surgeon at the hospital later explained to her:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got double mandibular condyle fractures on both sides of his face,\u201d meaning he broke his jaw in two places. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need to go in, obviously, and do surgery and wire his mouth shut,\u201d Siriani says the doctor told her.\n\nSiriani\u2019s dad has had to live in a nursing home ever since, fed through a feeding tube. She still doesn\u2019t know exactly what happened that night. Every staff member had a different story. The stories changed. There was no apology. She filed a complaint with the California Department of Social Services, or DSS.\n\n\u201cI must have called the state once a week, for at least the first three months,\u201d Siriani recalls. \u201cAnd I was just always told, \u2018We\u2019re working on it. We\u2019re working on it. We\u2019re working on it.'\u201d\n\nIt was a year before Siriani got an official report in the mail.\n\nDSS did send out an investigator who cited the facility. He also fined the operator of the facility the maximum amount allowed by law: a mere $150. In comparison, the maximum penalty in a California nursing home is $100,000. \u201cYou know,\u201d says Siriani, \u201ca couple hundred dollars to these places is absolutely nothing.\u201d But her life and her father\u2019s life was \u201cturned around forever.\u201d\n\nBy then, Siriani had hired a lawyer. His investigators uncovered chronic under-staffing, poor training, and a known issue with the lock on the door her father passed through. The facility settled for an undisclosed sum. (And as part of the settlement, Siriani agreed not to name the facility publicly.)\n\nPat Leary is chief deputy director for the California Department of Social Services, the primary agency responsible for oversight of assisted living facilities. Leary acknowledges the criticism that $150 isn\u2019t big enough to serve as a deterrent. As part of its annual budget proposal this year, the DSS suggested raising the fine, but that requires an act of the state legislature.\n\n\u201cCivil penalties are set in statute, and most of those statutes haven\u2019t changed over time for many, many years.\u201d\n\nThere is legislation pending that would address some of the issues raised by Siriani\u2019s experience. AB 2236 would raise the maximum fine from $150 to $15,000. AB 1554 would require the DSS to investigate within one working day if the complaint alleges abuse or imminent danger and then report back within 10 days. [UPDATE: AB 1554 failed to make it out of the Senate Appropriations Committee.]\n\n[Related: Lawmakers Have 4 Weeks to Act on Assisted Living Reforms]\n\nWhat\u2019s less clear is how the agency\u2019s 462 inspectors are going to meet that new standard if it\u2019s signed into law. They\u2019re not just responsible for the state\u2019s 7,800 assisted living facilities, but all of the 66,000 facilities DSS oversees, including foster care homes.\n\n\u201cWe issue thousands of citations in any given year,\u201d Leary says. \u201cThe last year I had data was for 2012-13, we issued over 55,000 citations.\u201d But, she adds, not all complaints are equal. \u201cUnderstand it\u2019s a complete range \u2014 from the most serious and extreme critical issues death and serious bodily injury \u2014 to not finding a parking place in front.\u201d\n\nLeary says there is no average time for processing a complaint \u2014 and no way to say, for instance, what the most common kinds of complaints are, or how long it typically takes to investigate a complaint.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t categorize, due to the antiquated nature of our technology. We don\u2019t have a good data reporting system that gives us our most average complaint. But the ones that we clearly give the highest priority are ones that deal with immediate health and safety issues.\u201d\n\nOther organizations do categorize the data. According to the Assisted Living Federation of America the number one kind of complaint in California in 2008 was about cleanliness.\n\nIf a DSS investigator uncovers evidence of a possible crime, a DSS spokesman says a referral would be made to the appropriate law enforcement agency \u2014 but the agency does not maintain statistics on the number of referrals. State Attorney General\u2019s offices report they\u2019ve gotten a few \u2014 at least since 2000, when a Congressional act gave them the jurisdiction to pursue these kinds of cases.\n\nBut in San Diego, the county district attorney\u2019s office has not gotten referrals. Deputy District Attorney Paul Greenwood says the county DA\u2019s office has not gotten any referrals. And he\u2019s the one who would know. Greenwood has specialized in prosecuting elder abuse in San Diego for 18 years, unusual for a DA in California. He says he can\u2019t think of a single case brought to his attention by the DSS.\n\nBut he\u2019s quick to add all that may be water under the bridge now. A couple of months ago, he was invited to a stakeholders\u2019 meeting \u2014 at the local DSS office.\n\n\u201cIn their office!\u201d Greenwood exclaimed. \u201cFirst time I\u2019ve ever been involved in one of those. At the table was the sheriff\u2019s department, paramedics, the police department, attorney general, me, city attorney. I mean, in 18 years, I\u2019ve never seen this happen before.\u201d\n\nGreenwood credits a change of personnel. Others suggest political pressure may have something to do with it: particularly, a series of articles published last fall by San Diego Union Tribune/Center for Health Reporting. \u201cDeadly Neglect,\u201d as the series was called, detailed 27 deaths in assisted living in San Diego County \u2014 deaths caused by neglect and abuse.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t surprise me, on one hand,\u201d Greenwood says of the reports, \u201cbut there were some things that were being revealed through these articles that even shocked my conscience, and I was hoping that someone would take notice. Well, they did!\u201d\n\nIndeed. The reports were so dramatic, they inspired a round of legislative reform in Sacramento not seen in 30 years. [UPDATE: The governor has signed two bills into law. Another 10 are still pending.]\n\nMeanwhile, county supervisors, led by Diane Jacob, decided not to wait for the state to act. They gave Greenwood\u2019s office $1.3 million dollars to launch a one-year pilot program to focus on assisted living facilities. It\u2019s the only unit of its kind in a California county DA\u2019s office.\n\nWhen Greenwood started, he found it difficult to get the kind of tips that would lead to a criminal investigation, let alone prosecution. But over the years, he built up a network of sources. \u201cBy the end of year one,\u201d he recalls, \u201cI issued 16 felony cases. Well, this is year 18. We\u2019ll probably have issued about 400.\u201d\n\nUnder the pilot program, Greenwood expects to be swamped with leads shortly.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A San Diego case points to problems statewide in investigating complaints in assisted living facilities.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Crime in Assisted Living: What Happens After\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/08\\/11\\/crime-in-assisted-living-what-happens-after\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-08-11 05:50:56\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-08-15 14:03:42\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":20526,\"author_id\":\"251\",\"author_name\":\"Rachael Myrow\",\"author_display_name\":\"Rachael Myrow\",\"tags\":[\"Aging\",\"Assisted Living Facilities\",\"Senior Health\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/08\\/RS11391_photo-hpf.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "A San Diego case points to problems statewide in investigating complaints in assisted living facilities.", "title": "Crime in Assisted Living: What Happens After", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/08/11/crime-in-assisted-living-what-happens-after/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/08/RS11391_photo-hpf.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@rachaelmyrow"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "aging,assisted living facilities,senior health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1021\"", "article_summary": "When families place a loved one in an assisted living facility, there\u2019s an expectation that if something goes wrong, there will be consequences.\nThey gave Greenwood\u2019s office $1.3 million dollars to launch a one-year pilot program to focus on assisted living facilities.\nHer experience with assisted living began four years ago when she got an awful phone call from Houston.\nAccording to the Assisted Living Federation of America the number one kind of complaint in California in 2008 was about cleanliness.\n\u201cDeadly Neglect,\u201d as the series was called, detailed 27 deaths in assisted living in San Diego County \u2014 deaths caused by neglect and abuse."}
