Curt Bramble, R-Provo, the incoming president of the National Conference of State Legislatures, supports bill, arguing that online retailers should have to collect the same taxes as bricks-and-mortar retailers.\n\n\u201cUtah was one of the first states to push this movement beginning in the late 1990s,\u201d Bramble told KSL TV. \u201cThe position from legislators across the country, from governors, from counties, from cities is 15 years of [dialogue] on the issue and 20 months being in a committee, is long enough to have had a [dialogue] on it.\u201d\n\nA hearing on the Utah bill will take place today, and critics are lining up to fight the measure.\n\nOpponents of an Internet sales tax call the legislation unconstitutional, arguing that states don\u2019t have authority to demand taxes from a business lacking a physical presence in the state.\n\nSteve DelBianco, executive director of NetChoice, wrote in a letter to Utah state Sen. Deidre Henderson, R-Spanish Fork, that while he understands the need for states to collect revenue, this bill won\u2019t accomplish that\u2014and is unlikely to survive legal challenges.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Supreme Court has long held that states cannot impose tax obligations on a business that lacks the necessary connections to that state. That necessary connection now means a physical presence,\u201d DelBianco wrote, citing the 1992 Quill v. North Dakota decision.\n\n\u201cThe duty of out-of-state businesses with no physical presence in Utah to register and obtain licensing with the Utah tax commission is likewise unconstitutional,\u201d he added.\n\n>>> Commentary: Why Internet Sales Tax Is Bad for Everyone\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Signal, NetChoice policy counsel Carl Szabo said supporters of the federal Marketplace Fairness Act are using a state-based strategy because their Internet sales tax legislation isn\u2019t gaining any traction in Congress.\n\n\u201cUtah\u2019s bill is one such effort,\u201d Szabo said. \u201cThis bill operates as a scorched-earth maneuver that\u2019s unlikely to capture new revenue and will likely impose costs for Utah to fight an unwinnable lawsuit over its constitutionality.\u201d\n\nBramble, the bill\u2019s sponsor, said he supports the bill because of \u201cgridlock in Washington.\u201d He argues states should be able to set their own tax rules.\n\n\u201cWith broad and bipartisan support, including many conservative Republicans, the Senate [in 2013] passed the Marketplace Fairness Act, which would allow states to collect already-owed Internet and remote sales taxes from online businesses. The bill aims to establish a fair and level playing field on which all businesses can compete, while restoring powers back to state governments what was stripped through an antiquated court decision more than 20 years ago,\u201d Bramble wrote in Utah\u2019s Daily Herald.\n\nHowever, Heritage Foundation tax policy expert Curtis Dubay said that\u2019s not the case and the Utah bill is a misguided approach.\n\n\u201cOnline sales taxes are an issue for Congress to decide, as determined by the Supreme Court in its Quill decision. States shouldn\u2019t try to solve the issue on their own. Congress is working slowly and methodically because this is a difficult problem to resolve,\u201d Dubay told The Daily Signal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Utah is considering legislation that would mandate out-of-state online retailers to collect Utah sales taxes.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Utah is considering legislation that would mandate out-of-state online retailers to collect Utah sales taxes.", "title": "Utah Plan Would Force Out-of-State Online Retailers to Collect State Sales Tax", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock_000022454433_Medium.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1vjVQAB"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Utah is considering legislation that would mandate out-of-state online retailers to collect Utah sales taxes.", "title": "Utah Plan Would Force Out-of-State Online Retailers to Collect State Sales Tax", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock_000022454433_Medium.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "taxes", "published_time": "2015-02-11T11:11:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Utah, internet tax, marketplace fairness act, Utah senate, state taxes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaf6e\"", "article_summary": "Utah is considering legislation that would mandate out-of-state online retailers to collect Utah sales taxes or obtain a license to continue selling their products in the state.\n>>> Commentary: Why Internet Sales Tax Is Bad for EveryoneIn an interview with The Daily Signal, NetChoice policy counsel Carl Szabo said supporters of the federal Marketplace Fairness Act are using a state-based strategy because their Internet sales tax legislation isn\u2019t gaining any traction in Congress.\n\u201cThe duty of out-of-state businesses with no physical presence in Utah to register and obtain licensing with the Utah tax commission is likewise unconstitutional,\u201d he added.\n\u201cOnline sales taxes are an issue for Congress to decide, as determined by the Supreme Court in its Quill decision.\nUtah state Sen.
