In the days that followed, in the midst of full-on radio silence from University of Illinois administration, many have speculated that Chancellor Wise came under pressure from powerful and politically influential outside interest groups who objected to Salaita\u2019s views on Israeli policy and Israeli Defense Forces' \u201cOperation Protective Edge\u201d in Gaza, as expressed in social media. In the meantime, observers, allies, Salaita critics, and critics of Salaita\u2019s termination, have debated what rests at the center of this event, the (ir)relevance of political commentary to a faculty hire.\n\nRELATED: Dr. Steven Salaita Fired for Speaking His Mind on Israel and Gaza\n\nConsider this. In the fall of 2013, the University of Illinois American Indian Studies Program, ran a search for a new faculty hire. The process, likely similar to the majority of university hiring practices, included a rigorous review of each applicant\u2019s publications, teaching, and service record by a faculty committee. As to publications, the committee read each candidate\u2019s scholarship, considered the reputation of the presses and journals in which the work was published, and read available reviews of the work. Written letters of recommendation from scholars in the field would have included assessments of a candidate\u2019s scholarship and standing in the field. Finalists visited the campus, gave talks and perhaps lectures in class, met with individual faculty members, met with the Dean\u2019s office, and sat through lunches and dinners, which are also opportunities to gauge candidates.\n\nParenthetically, I have participated in numerous searches. Never have we examined a candidate\u2019s comments, political or otherwise, in social media; we are only concerned with the rigor of a candidate\u2019s scholarship and teaching history. After that, and only after all that, the AIS faculty met to share their views, debate, consider, and come to a consensus about the best candidate for the position. They forwarded that recommendation to the Dean\u2019s office, who then sent it forward to the Chancellor with approval. In October 2013, Professor Salaita received an appointment (with tenure) offer from the University of Illinois.\n\nThe faculty of one of the country\u2019s most highly regarded American Indian Studies Programs, each from an American Indian tribe, are internationally recognized for exemplary scholarship, leadership in the field, distinguished graduate education, and national service. The director is one of the founders of the Native American and Indigenous Studies Association (NAISA), which six short years after being formally established, claims some 800 members. By this action, Chancellor Wise has cast aspersions on the AIS faculty and sullied the program\u2019s carefully crafted international reputation for cutting edge scholarship, graduate education, and leadership in American Indian Studies, an at-risk academic field.\n\nColleagues are grieved to see the University of Illinois AIS faculty undermined in such a disrespectful manner, one that is painfully reminiscent of colonial practices. In short, the University of Illinois administration has put our colleagues on a reservation where they must ask for permission to step outside its boundaries in matters of program administration, expression of opinion, and affiliation. I fear that this will have a chilling effect on their ability to hire in the future because whether the University of Illinois administration recognizes a reservation when they see one or not, the rest of Native America and the American Indian Studies community has no trouble distinguishing one.\n\nIn the meantime, these fine Native scholars apparently exist to represent diversity, but not to exercise agency, the hallmark characteristic of today\u2019s neoliberal, neocolonial academy. As for Professor Salaita, he might as well be in Gaza, his family\u2019s homeland, deprived of the ability to work, of access to housing, of freedom of expression, the direct result of actions taken by the University of Illinois, a publicly funded institution, which has apparently caved to an outside interest group to its everlasting shame.\n\nJacki Thompson Rand, is a citizen of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, and an associate professor of history at the University of Iowa, who is currently writing a book on violence against Native women in the 20th century.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jacki Thompson Rand, Choctaw, an associate professor of history at the University of Iowa, says the University of Illinois is creating a reservation.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/21/academic-reservation-making-156493", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/dr._steven_salaita.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "An Academic Reservation in the Making"}, "abstract": "Jacki Thompson Rand, Choctaw, an associate professor of history at the University of Iowa, says the University of Illinois is creating a reservation.", "dc": {"title": "An Academic Reservation in the Making"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/21/academic-reservation-making-156493", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Free Speech, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champagne, Dr. Steven Salaita, United Nations Human Rights Council, Occupied Palestinian Territory, Executive Committee of the American Studies Association, American Associations of University Professors, Academic Freedom and Electronic Communications", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2014-08-21T12:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "An Academic Reservation in the Making"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd81a5\"", "article_summary": "In the fall of 2013, the University of Illinois American Indian Studies Program, ran a search for a new faculty hire.\nIn October 2013, Professor Salaita received an appointment (with tenure) offer from the University of Illinois.\nBy this action, Chancellor Wise has cast aspersions on the AIS faculty and sullied the program\u2019s carefully crafted international reputation for cutting edge scholarship, graduate education, and leadership in American Indian Studies, an at-risk academic field.\nThe director is one of the founders of the Native American and Indigenous Studies Association (NAISA), which six short years after being formally established, claims some 800 members.\nThe faculty of one of the country\u2019s most highly regarded American Indian Studies Programs, each from an American Indian tribe, are internationally recognized for exemplary scholarship, leadership in the field, distinguished graduate education, and national service."}
