I wanted to show a strong Indian woman. And I wanted to show a soldier who could be any soldier\u2014he could be Native, he could be any soldier\u2014because I think it's important to represent all our people,\u201d Marchand told the news site Kelowna Now. \u201cMy uncle said that when they got into the trenches, they were a band of brothers.
