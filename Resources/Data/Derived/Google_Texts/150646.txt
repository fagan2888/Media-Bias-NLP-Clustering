Sandwiched between two recent high profile pro oil-and-gas events in Colorado was a news conference on the the west steps of the state Capitol where a group called the Moms Clean Air Force talked about increased air pollution because oil-and-gas development.

Former House Majority Leader Alice Madden, a Boulder Democrat who most recently worked for the U.S. Department of Energy, was among the speakers at the event.

“We must raise our collective voices to demand clean air and water, not just for our kids, but many generations to come,” Madden said. “We all must lead.”

The speakers at the event noted that as the nation drills for more natural gas, it must deal with methane pollution. Last year Colorado enacted the nation’s first rules to cut methane pollution, but climate change and air pollution don’t stop at state borders, they said.

“As a mom, I care deeply about my the health of my children and what the world will be like when they grow up,” said Annie Ekblad, a Windsor resident. “That’s why I am demanding the EPA take action to regulate methane.”

Moms Clean Air Force says on its website that it is a “community of hundreds of thousands of moms — and dads! — working together to combat air pollution, including the urgent crisis of our changing climate.” The group held its news conference on May 29.

Two days earlier in Denver, Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, and U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner, a Republican, discussed Colorado’s energy future at a breakfast. They agreed on many issues, including expanding opportunities for global oil exports. The event was attended by top movers-and-shakers in the industry, including Dan Haley, the new director of the Colorado Oil and Gas Association.

And last week, the American Petroleum Institute and the Colorado Petroleum Council hosted a dinner to highlight efforts to attract women to work in the industry.
