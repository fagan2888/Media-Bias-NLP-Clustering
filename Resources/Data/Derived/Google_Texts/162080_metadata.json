Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) \u201cgood luck with your asparagus.\u201d\n\nMany, including TheBlaze, assumed Holder was mocking Gohmert for seemingly fumbling his words back in 2013 when he said, \u201cThe attorney general will not cast aspersions on my asparagus!\u201d\n\nGohmert was ridiculed at the time by Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Colbert Report,\u201d the Washington Post, the U.K. Guardian and more for the \u201cfamously embarrassing\u201d moment.\n\nBut Gohmert told Glenn Beck on Wednesday that he did not fumble his words back in 2013, and was in fact using a quote that goes back decades.\n\n\u201cPercy Foreman was a very, very liberal criminal defense attorney, but he was incredible in the courtroom,\u201d Gohmert said on Beck\u2019s radio show. \u201cWhen somebody started attacking his integrity, he stood up and said, \u2018I object, he\u2019s casting aspersions on my asparagus!\u2019 And people would scratch their heads, but it brought down the level of the rancor. I was using a Percy Foreman line from criminal trials back probably 50 years ago.\u201d\n\nOther research confirms that the line was used in decades past. A 1973 book by John Dos Passos includes a letter where an individual says, \u201cdon\u2019t think that I\u2019m \u2018casting asparagus\u2019\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd in \u201cThe Three Stooges,\u201d a chef even parodies the line by demanding, \u201cAre you casting asparagus on my cooking?\u201d\n\nBeck said it seems as though Holder was not aware of the reference, and has been holding onto the line to use as an insult for almost a year.\n\n\u201cFor a year that\u2019s been simmering under there,\u201d Gohmert agreed, saying if the Justice Department would just produce the documents it has been withholding from Congress, these constant trials and exchanges would not be necessary.\n\n\u201cThe guys had a year to think about that line. He has waited a year. That is psychotic!\u201d Beck said.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nThe full episode of The Glenn Beck Program, along with many other live-streaming shows and thousands of hours of on-demand content, is available on just about any digital device.
