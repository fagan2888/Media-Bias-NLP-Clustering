Medicaid, the government insurance for the poor, has 74 percent of its patients in managed-care programs, although Tennessee has all of its Medicaid clients in such a program.\n\nGuertin noted that Medicare and Medicaid have been particularly important because they're both profitable and growing. Medicare is growing because of the baby boomers' aging; Medicaid, because eligibility was expanded as part of Obamacare.\n\nMedicare Advantage was the No. 1 reason Aetna wanted to buy Humana, he said. \"Obviously, that's the real pearl,\" he said.\n\n\"From our standpoint we think Medicare Advantage is one of the most attractive places to be,\" he said, because of the baby boomer bulge and the ability to maintain profit margins in the 4 percent to 6 percent range.\n\nAetna's Humana deal puts pressure on Cigna Bloomberg\u2019s Ed Hammond discusses deals within the healthcare sector.

After the merger is approved \u2014 even assuming divestitures \u2014 it will have offerings for 90 percent of Medicare patients.\n\nGuertin added, \"The second thing I love is the commercial business.\" He said that when he says that, \"Everybody looks at me cockeyed.\"\n\nThat's because Humana's profits from insurance sold to employers have not been as high as they are at most companies.\n\n\"I always like finding things I can make better,\" Guertin said. \"We have a large, very competitive commercial network. ... We can take that business, literally put it onto our infrastructure, the efficiencies that exist in our commercial business, and go at it pretty quickly.\"\n\nBoth Guertin and Cordani projected that the large majority of the savings their companies project as a result of their proposed merger will come from cost-cutting in sales and administration. Neither gave specifics about where the cuts might come.\n\nCordani said that while the bulk of the savings of an Anthem-Cigna merger will come from cost cuts in the first two years of integration, the long-term benefit is in giving Cigna access to Anthem customers to sell dental, disability, behavioral or other specialty insurance lines, as well as the ability to expand ancillary services, such as prescription benefit management.\n\n\"Anybody can go in and cut expenses and deliver a number,\" Cordani said. \"Smart synergies come from understanding how you want to create value and getting the leverage off of that.\"\n\nSchenker asked Cordani how Cigna manages to control medical inflation among its patient population better than any other company.\n\nCordani said Cigna has been the best by this metric \u2014 or tied for best \u2014 for three years. He said Cigna has figured out how to motivate individual patients to make changes in their lives that make them healthier: If they're overweight, losing weight. If they have high cholesterol, controlling it. If they're pregnant, going to the doctor consistently, which, he said, leads to fewer premature births.\n\n\"When you do that, you're able to generate a better quality outcome that creates a better cost outcome,\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Aetna, Cigna: Medicare, Medicaid Driving Profits, Growth", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Hartford Courant", "author": "Hartford Courant", "og": {"site_name": "courant.com", "description": "The two major health insurers headquartered in Greater Hartford told analysts Thursday that the money they make handling government insurance programs is the biggest reason their profits have been strong this year.", "title": "Aetna, Cigna: Medicare, Medicaid Driving Profits, Growth", "url": "http://www.courant.com/business/hc-aetna-cigna-merger-outlook-20150917-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55fb4811/turbine/hc-aetna-cigna-merger-outlook-20150917", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp03.14", "twitter": {"site": "@hartfordcourant", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Aetna, Cigna, mergers, analyst, discussion, cost-cutting", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=391113483, app-argument=http://www.courant.com/deeplinkid/84457116", "fb": {"admins": 14500562, "page_id": 49693986601, "app_id": 152391743139}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-09-18", "Description": "medicare advantage, medicaid, Aetna, Humana, Anthem, Cigna, mergers", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Aetna, Cigna, mergers, analyst, discussion, cost-cutting"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca818\"", "article_summary": "Medicare, the taxpayer-paid insurance that covers those 65 and older as well as some disabled people, has been partially privatized with Medicare Advantage plans.\n\"I always like finding things I can make better,\" Guertin said.\nMedicare Advantage was the No.\nAetna has announced plans to buy health insurer Humana, and Anthem intends to purchase Cigna.\nSchenker asked Cordani how Cigna manages to control medical inflation among its patient population better than any other company."}
