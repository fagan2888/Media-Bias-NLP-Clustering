FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) — A teen fugitive who’s known for using an “affluenza” defense in a trial for a deadly drunken-driving wreck is being detained in a Mexico City immigration facility while his mother is jailed in Los Angeles after being deported from Mexico. Here’s a look at what has happened so far and what could happen in coming days or weeks:

ARREST IN MEXICO

Tonya Couch and her 18-year-old son, Ethan, were taken into custody this week in Mexico, where authorities believe the pair fled to in November as Texas prosecutors investigated whether he had violated his probation.

Ethan Couch was driving drunk and speeding near Fort Worth in June 2013 when he crashed into a disabled SUV, killing four people and injuring several others, including passengers in his pickup truck. He pleaded guilty to four counts of intoxication manslaughter and two counts of intoxication assault causing serious bodily injury and was sentenced to 10 years’ probation.

During the sentencing phase of his trial, a defense expert argued that Couch’s wealthy parents had coddled him into a sense of irresponsibility — a condition the expert termed “affluenza.” The condition is not recognized as a medical diagnosis by the American Psychiatric Association, and its invocation drew ridicule.

Texas prosecutors believe the mother and son fled the state after a video surfaced that appears to show Ethan Couch at a party where people were drinking. He then missed a mandatory Dec. 10 appointment with his probation officer.

The mother and son were arrested Monday after using a phone to order pizza that was traced to a condominium complex in the resort city of Puerto Vallarta.

DELAY IN DEPORTATION

Ethan Couch won a delay in deportation on Wednesday, a ruling that could lead to a drawn-out court process if a Mexican judge decides Couch has grounds to challenge his deportation based on arguments that kicking him out of Mexico would violate his rights.
