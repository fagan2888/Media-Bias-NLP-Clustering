We must ask ourselves how we reached the point where a parent\u2019s biggest fear is that government officials will literally seize our children off the streets as they walk in our neighborhoods. The Meitivs intend to fully vindicate their rights as parents and their children\u2019s rights, and to prevent this from happening to their children again. The CPS investigations and actions here are premised on a fundamental misapplication of the law and are contrary to the constitutional rights of these parents to raise their children as they see best.\u201d The actions of Maryland CPS and Montgomery County Police violate the fundamental rights parents have in raising their children. In Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 75 (2000), the Court explained that \u201cthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.\u201d This fundamental, constitutional right of parents cannot be infringed simply because certain governmental employees disagree with a parent\u2019s reasoned decision on how to raise his or her children. The Meitivs are troubled by the county\u2019s discretionary use of power to subject this happy, healthy and independent family to invasive, frightening and unnecessary government oversight, when there are other pressing challenges for county families in need.\n\nRead the rest here.\n\nThe police report on Sunday night\u2019s seizure of the Meitiv kids is also available here. Quick question: Aren\u2019t prisoners allowed one phone call, or is that just on TV? Because the Meitiv kids weren't able to contact their parents in the six hours they were held by the authorities.\n\nHat tip: The Washington Post", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The Meitivs get a lawyer", "title": "'Free-Range' Parents Will Sue CPS for Grabbing Their Kids", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/04/14/free-range-parents-will-sue-cps-for-grab", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14290413509092.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14290413509092.jpg", "title": "'Free-Range' Parents Will Sue CPS for Grabbing Their Kids", "description": "The Meitivs get a lawyer", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@reason"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-04-14T20:12:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/lenore-skenazy"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf982\"", "article_summary": "Because the Meitiv kids weren't able to contact their parents in the six hours they were held by the authorities.\nThe Meitivs intend to fully vindicate their rights as parents and their children\u2019s rights, and to prevent this from happening to their children again.\nThe Meitivs are lawyering up, and will file some kind of lawsuit against Montgomery County, Maryland, officials who took their children while the youngsters were walking outside by themselves.\nThe CPS investigations and actions here are premised on a fundamental misapplication of the law and are contrary to the constitutional rights of these parents to raise their children as they see best.\u201d The actions of Maryland CPS and Montgomery County Police violate the fundamental rights parents have in raising their children.\nThe police report on Sunday night\u2019s seizure of the Meitiv kids is also available here."}
