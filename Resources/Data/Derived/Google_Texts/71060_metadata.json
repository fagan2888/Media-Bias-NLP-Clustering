That\u2019s something that could be a distinct possibility for us, especially coinciding with the 20-year anniversary.\u201d\n\nA stadium game would be played at Denver\u2019s Coors Field, Sports Authority Field at Mile High or Folsom Field in Boulder, but Kroenke declined to speculate which venue is the leading candidate. He said having a college hockey game would be a natural fit for the event, as is the case with most Winter Classics or NHL Stadium Series.\n\nThe Avs open this season \u2014 Year 2 of the Joe Sakic/Patrick Roy era \u2014 Thursday at Minnesota. On Tuesday Kroenke sat between the two Hall of Famers at a news conference.\n\nKroenke doubts the Avs will match the 112 points and Central Division title they amassed last season but expects the team to be better prepared for the playoffs, where they were ousted in the first round.\n\n\u201cMy family is very excited about the growth that we saw our hockey club take last season, and we\u2019re excited to keep building on it,\u201d Kroenke said. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to play some real games to where they actually count. After talking to these guys (Sakic and Roy), they\u2019re pleased with what they saw at different times. While our record didn\u2019t show it (1-5-2 in exhibition games), certain players took steps towards being better overall players.\u201d\n\nRoy\u2019s top two lines Tuesday again had center Matt Duchene with veteran wingers Alex Tanguay and Jarome Iginla, and with Ryan O\u2019Reilly between Gabe Landeskog and Nathan MacKinnon. Those combinations were formed during Saturday\u2019s 3-2 shootout victory against the Los Angeles Kings in Las Vegas.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how we\u2019re going to start Thursday, but don\u2019t be surprised, we\u2019re going to try a lot of things,\u201d Roy said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much talent, so much possibility with this group. We\u2019re going to try (different combinations) for sure.\u201d\n\nThe Avs were outscored 22-10 in regulation and overtime in the preseason, but Sakic said that statistic should not be alarming.\n\n\u201cI was very happy with the way the guys played in the preseason. We didn\u2019t play bad. Our record maybe doesn\u2019t show it, but for the most part the guys had a good camp,\u201d Sakic said. \u201cWe had trouble at times scoring goals, but the scoring chances were there, and with the guys we have on our team I\u2019m not worried about goal scoring.\u201d\n\nOne of Sakic\u2019s primary goals during the offseason was to improve depth at forward and that has paid off. Center/wing John Mitchell has been plagued with migraines and hasn\u2019t played an exhibition game, and forward Jesse Winchester is recovering from a concussion. Fourth-line enforcer Patrick Bordeleau had offseason back surgery.\n\nYet, the current third and fourth lines prove this is a competitive group of forwards.\n\n\u201cWhen we have our full lineup together, we see a lot of good possibilities, and like Patrick said, there\u2019s a lot of different line combinations you can come up with,\u201d Sakic said.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avalanche owner Josh Kroenke pushing for outdoor game in 2015-16", "title": "Avalanche owner Josh Kroenke pushing for outdoor game in 2015-16", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/07/avalanche-owner-josh-kroenke-pushing-for-outdoor-game-in-2015-16/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141007__kronekep1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141007__kronekep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-07T15:00:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T14:41:57+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec34\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe have been working hard with the league and pushing the league quite hard to get an outdoor game,\u201d Kroenke said.\nAvalanche president and governor Josh Kroenke said he is optimistic that Colorado\u2019s 20th anniversary season in 2015-16 will include hosting the Winter Classic or NHL Stadium Series game.\nAfter talking to these guys (Sakic and Roy), they\u2019re pleased with what they saw at different times.\n\u201cI was very happy with the way the guys played in the preseason.\n\u201cThat\u2019s how we\u2019re going to start Thursday, but don\u2019t be surprised, we\u2019re going to try a lot of things,\u201d Roy said."}
