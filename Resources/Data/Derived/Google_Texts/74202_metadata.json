The country\u2019s security forces are increasingly weak and a dwindling revenue stream has been mostly sucked dry by corruption and fraud.\n\nRelated: $65 Billion Later, U.S. Hands the Reins to a Weak Afghan Army\n\nThe grim outlook in Afghanistan is documented frequently by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), whose gloomy reports cast a dark shadow over the U.S.\u2019s hundred billion dollar efforts.\n\nLast week, SIGAR reported that despite spending $65 billion to train and equip Afghan Security Forces, the troops have shrunk to their lowest level in years. The country and its civilians are increasingly vulnerable to insurgent attacks since NATO troops have ceased their combat mission.\n\nNow auditors are sounding alarms over the country\u2019s desperate economic outlook. They blame Afghanistan\u2019s declining revenue on a failed U.S. anti-corruption strategy.\n\nIn a letter to U.S. officials, IG John Sopko expressed concern that Afghanistan would not be able to meet its budgetary obligations next year or in the years to come because its domestic revenue has plummeted.\n\nRelated: What the Pentagon Is Hiding from its Auditors\n\nThe reason? Half the revenue generated by customs has reportedly been stolen.\n\n\u201cThe Afghan government\u2019s ongoing challenges in collecting customs revenue are of great concern, given that customs revenue regularly accounts for over a third of the Afghan government\u2019s domestic revenue,\u201d the auditors said in their new report.\n\nHiking the government\u2019s collection of domestic revenues has been a main goal of both Afghanistan and the U.S. Homeland Security\u2019s border management task force was designated to help weed out corruption on the border and train Afghan border police and customs police.\n\nHowever, when U.S. forces left the border last November, customs collections declined drastically.\n\nRelated: 7 Threats to U.S. Rebuilding Efforts in Afghanistan\n\n\u201cTheir departure coincided with the lowest customs revenue collection in at least the last four years,\u201d the auditors said. \u201cWhen there is a U.S. presence at the [Afghan] border, [that presence can] provide additional oversight and advisory services to Afghan officials, which helps to stem corrupt activities\u2026 When U.S. officials are not physically present at border crossings, corrupt and criminal activities often resume.\u201d\n\nWith the U.S.\u2019s attempt to secure and sustain the border falling short, it\u2019s likely even more customs revenue will be lost to corruption.\n\nAfghanistan has one of the lowest rates of revenue collection in the world. If a sizeable portion of its total annual revenue collection is being stolen \u2013 that\u2019s an ominous sign for its budget deficits.\n\nSince revenues were so low and Afghanistan couldn\u2019t meet its budget obligations last year, the U.S. provided $100 million to keep the government running. Now it may need to step in again next year. \u201cThese continued economic conditions could lead to another shortage in revenue that would likely require the Afghan government to obtain additional assistance from the international community and the U.S. government,\u201d said SIGAR.\n\nSo even though American troops have largely left \u2013 Afghanistan likely won\u2019t be financially independent from the U.S. for too long.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The U.S.", "title": "U.S. Still Giving a Corrupt Afghanistan a Blank Check", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/11/US-Still-Giving-Corrupt-Afghanistan-Blank-Check", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/afghanistan-blast_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/11/US-Still-Giving-Corrupt-Afghanistan-Blank-Check", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/afghanistan-blast_2.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The U.S.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdde53\"", "article_summary": "Rebuilding Efforts in Afghanistan\u201cTheir departure coincided with the lowest customs revenue collection in at least the last four years,\u201d the auditors said.\nIf a sizeable portion of its total annual revenue collection is being stolen \u2013 that\u2019s an ominous sign for its budget deficits.\nAfghanistan has one of the lowest rates of revenue collection in the world.\nHomeland Security\u2019s border management task force was designated to help weed out corruption on the border and train Afghan border police and customs police.\nSo even though American troops have largely left \u2013 Afghanistan likely won\u2019t be financially independent from the U.S. for too long."}
