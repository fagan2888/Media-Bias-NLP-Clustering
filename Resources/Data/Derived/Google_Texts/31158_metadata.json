But we\u2019re bad at some things\u2014including rugby, geography, and non-racist criminal justice. Our military succeeds at lots of things, too\u2014our soldiers shoot straight, maneuver with speed and precision, and fly helicopters well. But our military, too, is not perfect. One consequential task it\u2019s been bad at has been training other militaries. If it\u2019s any consolation, that\u2019s a lot tougher than growing wheat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe failings of the Afghan military, which we trained, has been identified as a key reason for why 5,500 American troops will remain in Afghanistan through the end of 2016 and President Obama\u2019s term. Fred Kaplan illuminates why we failed to adequately train Afghan soldiers, and why we\u2019ve failed to do so historically, in Aleppo and Baghdad, and decades ago in Saigon. With everything a national military needs to do and do well on its own, it\u2019s naive to imagine a short, successful exit strategy that relies on a competent, independent military that didn\u2019t exist before we invaded. Maybe we should rethink this whole invading countries thing\u2014unless we can find a way to stabilize war-torn countries by teaching them to cook pizza.\n\nCanada\u2019s new prime minister is a handsome man, but he\u2019s not just a hot piece of venison. He could change the world, too.\n\nWhy should you care about the Canadian election? For one thing, the prime minister designate is a fox. For another, the victory of Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberal Party might mean a greener North America. While Trudeau\u2019s predecessor was a vehement supporter of the Keystone XL pipeline, the new leader\u2019s enthusiasm for it is tepid, he openly opposes other pipelines, and he\u2019s against subsidies for the fossil fuel industry. Trudeau will bring a different Canada to global climate talks in December, and he has vowed to invest in green energy. He\u2019s signaled major changes to Canadian foreign policy, too, including the Great North\u2019s contributions to fighting ISIS, to diplomacy with Israel, and to confronting the Syrian refugee crisis. So sure, Justin Trudeau has flowing brunette locks, but if his hair and jaw don\u2019t do it for you, maybe his foreign policy will.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nMore wars: Of the star variety, over wine during pregnancy, and over streaming music.\n\nThe new Star Wars trailer is awesome. It hints at plot points from the expanded universe of books and comics, and has great music, too. This movie will make more money than has ever been printed anywhere in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nA glass of wine is probably safe for pregnant women. So why are they being told otherwise?\n\nApple music might be a total failure, or it might just be a disappointment.\n\nDo, or do not,\n\nSeth Maxon\n\nHome page editor for nights and weekends", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "Plus, the new Star Wars trailer rules.", "fb-share": "Plus, Justin Trudeau's beauty and STAR WARS.", "sailthru.author": "Seth  Maxon", "description": "Bonjour Slate-ecois, When it comes to cooking pizza, slamming dunks, and growing wheat, America succeeds.
