We\u2019re poolside, of course\u2014or at least at a picnic table on a sun deck overlooking a pool. Lydon belches loudly and says, \u201cJazz tones. Why didn\u2019t I put them on the record? Oh, hello. I did.\u201d The record he\u2019s talking about is the latest Public Image Ltd. extravaganza, entitled fill-in-the-blank style as What the World Needs Now\u2026 Famed torch singer Jackie DeShannon would clearly replace the ellipses with \u201cis love\u201d as she did on her soapy 1965 hit, but it seems unlikely that the former Sex Pistol is leaning toward anything quite so maudlin. Then again, you might be surprised: A quarter-century of living in America and untold decades of listening to reggae can change a person irreversibly. As such, the artist formerly known as Johnny Rotten isn\u2019t quite the angry young man who hoisted two upright fingers in the Queen\u2019s direction back in 1977. These days he\u2019ll hurl his best epithets from sunny California, because Johnny Rotten is now a U.S. citizen. And he\u2019s got plenty to say about it.\n\nRecommended Never Mind the Interest Rate, Here\u2019s the Sex Pistols Credit Card\n\nMajor Label Debut: Punk\u2019s \u201cSell Out\u201d Albums Revisited\n\n50 Things That Are Definitely, 100 Percent Confirmed PUNK\n\n\n\nBootboy Glam and Football Chants: Proto-Oi! in the 1970s United Kingdom\n\nNOISEY: You\u2019ve been doing interviews for nearly 40 years now. How do you feel about the process at this point?\n\nJohn Lydon: I like it very much. The British being what they are, I had to get over a few things when I started. It was usually resentful intelligentsia trying to tear me down. But those days are gone, and by sheer endurance I\u2019ve worn all that out. Now it\u2019s more like really good conversations with people, and I learn as much from them as they do from me. It sets me up well with the world.\n\nEven back in the early Sex Pistols interviews you gave as a very young man, you seemed to have a media savvy that most 20 to 21-year olds don\u2019t have. What do you attribute that to?\n\nWow. [Laughs] Well, I have amazing defensive strategies. That goes back to surviving a childhood illness that almost killed me. I lost my memory and spent so long recovering who I was and finding my personality that I think it set me up really well for the future. To my mind, recovering from spinal meningitis between ages seven and eleven made me what I am today. It was a punishing regime to go through at the time, but in the end it was a reward. In life, I don\u2019t endure self-pity, and I don\u2019t like it in others. You have to win through whatever life presents you because the only thing you\u2019re given in life is life itself. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any heaven, but I agree with Bob Marley: Heaven is on this earth. And I\u2019m resilient internally. I\u2019m physically dilapidated, but mentally efficient. [Laughs] Until that stops, the sheer enjoyment of life will continue.\n\nI understand you recently became an American citizen.\n\nYeah, two years back. And I\u2019m very, very glad. I\u2019ll tell you what amazes me, though. Talking to American journalists, I\u2019ve not heard, \u201cWell done\u201d or anything like it! It\u2019s just this negative wall, and I want to know what that means. Because let\u2019s face it: I\u2019m no friend of any government in the world, but if the American government accepted me\u2014of all the people in the world that could cause trouble for you\u2014aren\u2019t you happy for me?\n\nOf course, but it is surprising. As an American travelling to the UK or Europe\u2014especially during the Bush years\u2014I got the distinct impression that no sane, politically minded Briton or European would want to align themselves with the U.S.\n\nOh, I would\u2019ve never done it during the Bush years. The way America presented itself abroad\u2014as greedy, egotistical, violent monsters\u2014was horrible. And cowardly ones, too\u2014always hiding behind missiles and far-fetched weaponology. But the reality is a little different now. America has the potential to be a nation that actually cares for its afflicted and wounded and ill and disenfranchised. That\u2019s what Obamacare has brought into the agenda. So it was Obama that changed my mind. No matter how insanely the Republicans yak on about it, I don\u2019t see how they can take that back. And you know what? I can vote now.\n\nWill you?\n\nYeah, I will. And I\u2019ll vote properly. I\u2019ll vote for anyone who will not dismantle all those goods that people need. I don\u2019t mind spending my tax on my fellow human beings.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Paul Heartfield\n\nAs in the UK, you\u2019re not presented with much of a choice here in terms of candidates.\n\nIn England it\u2019s a small-time circus as opposed to the bigger clowns here. [Laughs] Do you really want the world run by a real estate agent who has a very low opinion of his fellow human beings but a very high opinion of himself? That\u2019s worrying. As opposed to an old biddy who doesn\u2019t know how to use a fax machine? [Laughs] I\u2019m spoilt for choice, aren\u2019t I?\n\nOn that note, let me be the first American journalist to welcome you to America.\n\n[Laughs] In Europe, I\u2019m being really ill considered for this because nobody stands up for America. But I do. I love the people here. It\u2019s a new country, and there\u2019s the possibility of changing everything for the better. You\u2019re not riddled with feudalism and ancient calamities.\n\nSuch as?\n\nMonarchy. Religion. Well, you do have a version of religion, but\u2014and I\u2019ve been in America for a long time now\u2014I think you also instinctively have an aversion to it. I can\u2019t speak for everyone who lives in a trailer, but that seems to be the people who are listening the least. And that\u2019s a terrible thing. We\u2019ve gotta change that. It\u2019s an education problem. Give people the facts and they\u2019ll work it out for the better. So our new song \u201cC\u2019est La Vie\u201d is my anthem to becoming an American. And then we have a song called \u201cBettie Page,\u201d about a woman who was denigrated as a stripper. But I think she was absolutely emperor in her approach to life. She had to endure all manner of hell of on earth. I also threw in Mae West and Robert Mapplethorpe. I remember when I first came to New York he was so hated for his photographs. But I thought they were hilarious and beautifully done. What the hell\u2014it\u2019s just human bodies! What is the frightening thing about human sexuality? We\u2019ve gotta get over that. It\u2019s always the Republicans that are railing against this stuff, and yet it\u2019s them that wear this [bondage] gear late at night when we\u2019re not watching. [Laughs]\n\nJust like it\u2019s always the right-wingers who insist homosexuality is evil but then get caught smoking meth in a hotel room with a male prostitute.\n\nThese right wingers are just nonstop humor. They espouse family values but have no idea what that really means. My fellow human beings are my family. As long as you don\u2019t steal from or denigrate your fellow human beings, it\u2019s fine by me. Sexuality, who cares? I draw the line at child molestation and pedophilia, but everything else? There\u2019s no harm in it, and it\u2019s none of your fucking business, quite frankly. Even the term\u2014gay, straight\u2014it doesn\u2019t make sense in the modern world. We need to stop thinking in terms of categories and clich\u00e9s. We need to understand that as human beings, we\u2019re all individuals. So there it is: Open minds. And if you\u2019re lucky, open legs! [Laughs]\n\nIs becoming an American citizen a subversive act for you?\n\nNo, I don\u2019t think so at all. I\u2019ve lived here for 25 years, so why not? I can\u2019t carry on paying tax abroad while enjoying America. I now want to pay tax back to the country that\u2019s giving me the joy I find in life.\n\nWhat was it that drew you here 25 years ago?\n\nWell, we couldn\u2019t get any gigs in Europe because of consistent banning and\u2014again\u2014the class system. No matter what I did or said, it would never be listened to properly. It was always the same old media claiming the same old \u201cfilth and fury\u201d nonsense and hammering me down for being an \u201coik\u201d and an \u201cignoramus\u201d and a member of the working class. So I found myself becoming a natural rebel\u2014and if you think about it, America is the home of rebellion. Look what you did with the royal family! [Laughs] Hello, that\u2019s the place for me. The only mistake of course was throwing all that tea into Boston Harbor. You could\u2019ve flogged it, you know\u2014that\u2019s money down the drain.\n\nThe new PiL album is called What The World Needs Now\u2026 How did you decide on the title?\n\nWell, the title has not much to do with the song called \u201cShoom\u201d which uses that line in the chorus. That song is from my father\u2019s point of view. It\u2019s like a requiem for him. I\u2019ve never written a song about my dad, but I miss him dearly. He was a very awkward fellow to live with, but he had a wonderful sense of comedy and humor that I only got used to in his later years of life. Actually, it wasn\u2019t until he kicked me out that we became friends. [Laughs] I\u2019m sure he\u2019d say what the world needs now is another \u201cfuck off.\u201d But that\u2019s his sense of humor. I don\u2019t think it needs another fuck off. It needs an opening, a transparency, a sharing of thought and empathy. You don\u2019t need enemies. Why keep making them?\n\nWhat do you think the Johnny Rotten of 1977 would say the world needs now?\n\nExactly the same. I have a sense of values that won\u2019t change because they\u2019re based on my life experiences. For example, I will never vote Republican. [Laughs] Sorry, I just can\u2019t consider that war-mongering philosophy as being of any use to me at all. And anything wrapping itself up in religious morality is a crime against nature. [Belches] They mean no good to any of us.\n\nYou made a behind-the-scenes video for the song \u201cDouble Trouble\u201d that shows the band in the studio. You look like you\u2019re having a lot of fun.\n\nYeah, that\u2019s exactly the idea. That\u2019s how cohesive and friendly we are with each other. That\u2019s reality there. And that\u2019s what Johnny Rotten of the 70s would have wanted, you know. But unfortunately he had to deal with the circumstances he found himself in. When I started PiL, I always wanted it to be this way. It took a long time to get here, but hello\u2014landed lucky.\n\nThe flipside of the \u201cDouble Trouble\u201d single includes a non-album track called \u201cTurkey Tits.\u201d We haven\u2019t heard it, so what can you tell us about it?\n\n[Laughs] Oh, it\u2019s a wonderful jazz-fusion laugh. After dinner one night I went into the studio on my own and just laid down this rant which was kind of a summary of something we were discussing over dinner about that early period of punk. It turned into this devastating deluge on Vivienne Westwood. [Laughs] She put a book out, and she\u2019s being sued now in Britain for plagiarism. Whole chapters are taken from other works. It amazed and amused me because she\u2019d taken a lot of my clothes idea when I was younger and stuck her name all over it. So I was used to that from her. The song is the only time in my life that I would acknowledge the word \u201crant,\u201d but it\u2019s done with a kind of endearing humor because I still have fond memories of her. In my heart and soul, I just want to give her a big hug and say, \u201cIt\u2019s alright. A bit of meat won\u2019t do you any damage.\u201d [Laughs]\n\nSpeaking of clothing, Sex Pistols t-shirts have become practically ubiquitous over the last 20 or so years. How do you feel about that?\n\nThis whole Sex Pistols industry is very dangerous because I have to keep a constant eye on it. It\u2019s expensive to do this sort of monitoring, but I don\u2019t want the legend and the quality of what we did to be denigrated into, say, what KISS so fondly seek. That\u2019s great for them, and I love what they do because their records are rubbish and they know it. So they sell more rubbish, and that\u2019s the fun of wearing a KISS t-shirt. [Laughs] You\u2019re having a word, aren\u2019t you? \u201cRubbish is good this year!\u201d But the Pistols are something else. The challenges we threw up to society were so deadly serious and carried such severe consequences that I don\u2019t want that to be lost in a quagmire of \u201cKISS me quick\u201d hats and seaside junk. I want to keep the younger audience aware of what we\u2019ve done for them. A lot of the freedoms people now take for granted are things that we had to endure an awful lot of tension and stress for. I was openly discussed in the Houses of Parliament under the Traitors and Treason Act, which carried a death penalty. Now tell me who\u2019s king of the punks? Pretentious moi? I\u2019m not being pretentious. I was facing imminent death\u2014or at least long-term lockup\u2014and that is not about a joke key ring.\n\nSo what do you think of something like the Warped Tour, an annual event that touts punk values but seems to have little in common with the ethos that you espoused?\n\nYou\u2019d have to explain what the Warped Tour is. [Laughs]\n\nI\u2019ll ask the question another way: Do you feel your legacy has been perverted?\n\nYes, it definitely was. One the one hand it\u2019s become violence and thuggery and moronic behavior, and on the other hand you have Green Day, who are coat hangers for studded leather jackets. Both aspects are vile and terrible, and both resent me for being the very person who gave them the voice and opportunity. That\u2019s a bizarre world for me to deal with. You start something with all the good intention you can possibly conceive of in the world and it becomes denigrated into this bottomless viper pit of resentment and dullness and blunt thought and macho nonsense. I was working class long before I was king of the punks, and my ideology has always been to improve my culture\u2019s situation in the world.\n\nDo you feel like you can\u2019t be responsible for what the next generation does with your legacy?\n\nI have to be responsible. I have to answer to it, because every time I run into one of these types of people, they\u2019re very volatile with me.\n\nIn what way?\n\nThey\u2019re plain outright nasty, and sometimes even physical, so deep is their resentment.\n\nWhy do you think that is?\n\nThe most basic instinct a human has\u2014and the lowest\u2014is jealousy. It is the root of the seven deadly sins. Which, amazingly, is fantastic subject matter for Public Image. So I\u2019m mocking the situation, but I\u2019m not really because it\u2019s a reality of how human beings can let you down and not want to listen. They just want to grab the first thing they can imitate and then stick with that. But that\u2019s not good enough. It\u2019s unhealthy. There can only be one Johnny Rotten. Why would you want to be anything like me? Why don\u2019t you share your life\u2019s experiences with us? Don\u2019t try to duplicate mine. It\u2019s like devil-worshippers: Satan would be shocked and surprised by his followers. And they\u2019d be so stupid as to not understand or accept him.\n\nTo what extent was PiL formed as a reaction to the Sex Pistols?\n\nNot a reaction\u2014an automatic indulgence, really. I just got fed up with the nonsense and the press that [Sex Pistols manager] Malcolm [McLaren] became so addicted to. It was a fiasco. He wasn\u2019t taking it serious, and I knew what I was writing needed to be taken serious. I wasn\u2019t putting these words together as flippant, glib acts of trivia. It was inevitable that we\u2019d split, so we did. I needed to move on and not duplicate what I\u2019d already done. So: PiL. I tried to involve my friends. It didn\u2019t always work out. Some of those friends stayed friends and some of those friends became enemies. This is the lesson in life you learn. But PiL is heart and soul for me. It\u2019s to tell it as it absolutely, truly is. And before I point the finger at others, I give myself a bloody good hiding and kicking for what I think might be my own faults. I have them, too.\n\nYou\u2019ve been the only consistent member of PiL since the band\u2019s formation in 1978, with a long line of ex-members between then and now. Do you feel like the last man standing?\n\nI\u2019ve called myself the last man standing, but that\u2019s in reference to the punk movement. I don\u2019t think the movement itself continued as a movement. It became very static and staid. It almost trapped itself in its own bubble and disciplined itself out of existence by rigid adherence to a strict punk look. Beyond that, [it adopted] the moronic idiocy of resorting to violent tactics rather than dealing with things intelligently. For me, the word is always going to be more powerful than the sword. [Belches]\n\nOne of my favorite guitarist, John McGeoch, was in PiL from 1986 to 1992\u2026\n\nWasn\u2019t he stunning? And that wonderful band Magazine that he was in. He was so good. He was a great friend, but we fell out because he got too involved with alcohol in such a seriously damaging and ridiculous way. These things happen. Sometimes people make mistakes and you do your best to pull them away from it, but they won\u2019t have it. I\u2019ve lost so many friends in music\u2014Sid [Vicious], McGeoch\u2014they become self-absorbed. You mustn\u2019t do that. You\u2019ve gotta have the capability to laugh at yourself. That\u2019s how you get out of those entrapments and actually analyze yourself. When you can laugh at yourself you realize when you\u2019re being a bit foolish. The ironic thing about John is that he could be very, very funny. But then he\u2019d go morose as soon as too much alcohol hit him. He loved the martinis. Once he got up to six, seven, eight\u2014that was it. Something in his character would switch and you\u2019d have to get up and walk away from him. But I loved working with him.\n\nDo you feel John and Sid\u2019s deaths were inevitable because of their lifestyles?\n\nNo\u2026 well, it wasn\u2019t inevitable that that would be their lifestyles, but once they chose that direct, easy way out, death became inevitable. They kind of pushed themselves into it. They cut off all their options\u2014deliberately so. That\u2019s very difficult to cope with. It leaves the friends, the survivors, feeling somewhat guilty and thinking, \u201cWhat more could I have done?\u201d That kind of suicide option is one of the most amazingly selfish things you can do. You so damage and spite your friends. It shouldn\u2019t be an option at all.\n\nFormer PiL bassist Jah Wobble once said that most of the people in the band were \u201cdislikable little shits, including myself.\u201d Do you agree?\n\nI\u2019m sure that\u2019s my quote. [Laughs] I think it is, actually. But it\u2019s still applicable. It\u2019s that sense of self-doubt you have. I think it\u2019s a valuable tool, actually, to consistently question yourself so your ego doesn\u2019t take over.\n\nDoes PiL mean the same thing to you today as it did when you started the band nearly 40 years ago?\n\nIt\u2019s what I wanted it to be. It\u2019s that inner trust and belief in the capabilities of your fellow passengers in life. There\u2019s great comfort to be drawn from that because when you make mistakes, they\u2019re there to pull you back up. I love the camaraderie of being in a band. It\u2019s essential, really. I grew up as a bit of loner because of childhood illness. I didn\u2019t really have any friends at all until I went to secondary school at age 11, and then things changed because it was entirely different people. But I discovered the school had a file on me carried over from my previous school saying nasty things about me because I wasn\u2019t a good Catholic and I\u2019m left-handed. [Laughs] That\u2019s how serious adults run our world! It\u2019s a good education, I\u2019ll tell you. It hardens you up, solidifies the armor and prepares you well for the future. So I developed this incredibly brilliant suit of armor that allowed me to handle interviews with all manner of comedians and intellectuals. But now I\u2019m 60 years old and I can\u2019t be bothered with defenses anymore. I\u2019ve got nothing to defend because I\u2019ve done no harm to anyone. So now I just speak from the heart.\n\n\n\nJ. Bennett is more of an antichrist than an anarchist.
