Scott Applewhite\n\nA flag on the Supreme Court building's front plaza flies at half-staff on February 25, 2016, in honor of Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nEndnotes and citations are available in the PDF and Scribd versions.\n\nDownload the report:\n\nPDF\n\nPDF Read it in your browser:\n\nScribd\n\nWithin an hour of the news of Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s passing on February 13, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said the Senate should not consider any U.S. Supreme Court nominee until the next president is inaugurated in 2017. Since then, most Senate Republicans have signed on to Sen. McConnell\u2019s obstructionist threat, including Judiciary Committee Chair Charles Grassley (R-IA). This dereliction of constitutional duty is unprecedented. The longest it has ever taken for a Supreme Court nominee to reach a confirmation vote is 125 days.\n\nIn 2012, the American people re-elected President Barack Obama to do his job for another four years, and that job includes fulfilling his constitutional obligation to fill any vacancies on the Supreme Court. Likewise, the Senate must do its job and \u201cadvise and consent\u201d on the nominee. The Constitution contains no exception to those obligations for presidential election years.\n\nDown one justice, any 4-4 tied votes from the Court would result in a default upholding of decisions by regional circuit courts or state supreme courts. Some circuit courts could make federal law for the entire nation. In other areas of the law, Americans could have different constitutional rights in different parts of the country. The U.S. Supreme Court could hold some of these cases over until its next term\u2014which starts in October\u2014leaving millions of Americans waiting for justice.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court cannot decide the nation\u2019s most critical and divisive issues, countless lives hang in the balance. Tens of millions of women live in states with laws that are shutting down abortion clinics. More than 6 million Americans have loved ones who are unauthorized immigrants fearing deportation. There are millions of students graduating high school unsure of whether the Supreme Court will allow states to choose affirmative action to diversify colleges. The Court\u2019s redistricting cases could affect millions of voters or even the entire country. Millions of public employees who rely on strong unions could have their economic security threatened. Thousands of Americans work for religious employers that are arguing that their right to religious freedom outweighs the rights of their employees to access the contraceptive health care to which they are legally entitled.\n\nMore than 100 million Americans are waiting for the Supreme Court to decide critical issues that affect their lives: United States v. Texas: More than 6 million U.S. citizens with family members who are unauthorized parents or DREAMers\n\nWhole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt: Around 18 million women of reproductive age in 12 states with targeted regulation of abortion providers, or TRAP, laws\n\nZubik v. Burwell: Hundreds of thousands of Americans who work for religious institutions and their families, including more than 750,000 employees of Catholic hospitals alone\n\nFisher v. University of Texas at Austin: Around 1.5 million students of color who graduate high school each year\n\nWittman v. Personhuballah: 1 million voters in Virginia and 2 million in North Carolina\n\nEvenwel v. Abbott: 75 million children and 11 million unauthorized immigrants\n\nFriedrichs v. California Teachers Association: More than 7 million public-sector workers\n\nAmericans cannot afford to wait another year for answers to these crucial questions. As senators refuse to act, the public pays the price of obstructionist politics. If these senators follow through on their threat and refuse to vote on any Supreme Court nominee until 2017, their blatant obstruction could harm the Court\u2019s ability to make decisions for two terms. The millions of Americans whose lives and livelihoods are on the line would have to wait for justice.\n\nMore than 6 million family members of unauthorized immigrants and DREAMers\n\nThe Supreme Court is reviewing a ruling from the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in United States v. Texas that struck down the Obama administration\u2019s Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA, and expanded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, plans. These plans would allow nearly 4 million unauthorized parents and DREAMers to request temporary protection from deportation and authorization to work. This would ensure that the 6.3 million family members of these immigrants are not torn from their loved ones.\n\nExpanded DACA applies to unauthorized immigrants who entered the United States before 2010 and before their 16th birthday. DAPA applies to parents of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents who have lived in the country since 2010. Both plans exclude immigrants with criminal records.\n\nThe 5th Circuit\u2019s order to block the plans was unusual in that it halted implementation across the entire nation, not just within the 5th Circuit. The court claimed that a nationwide injunction was required because of the Constitution\u2019s mandate of a \u201cuniform rule\u201d for immigration across the country\u2014and the two-judge majority in the case took it upon itself to decide the scope of this rule.\n\nUnauthorized parents and children are languishing in a cruel limbo of uncertainty. Two Colorado parents who represent the millions who could benefit from DAPA, Alejandro and Estrella, have three children who are U.S. citizens. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad when your children know this struggle,\u201d said Estrella, \u201cWhen you have to explain to your kids what would happen if you\u2019re taken away. \u2026 You know your children shouldn\u2019t have to go through that. They should be worry-free.\u201d\n\nThe Center for American Progress found that implementing DAPA and the new DACA, along with the original DACA policy from 2012, \u201cwould dramatically raise the wages of all Americans by a cumulative $124 billion over a decade\u201d and add an estimated $230 billion to the country\u2019s gross domestic product in 10 years:\n\nWhen approximately 5.2 million individuals are able to work legally and live without fear of deportation, they will have greater opportunities to find new jobs that match their skillsets and will be even more economically productive. Their lawful work authorization will make them less vulnerable to wage theft and workplace exploitation. These factors all lead to higher wages and more job security, which translate into more tax revenue generated and more economic activity across the nation.\n\nDespite these high stakes, the 5th Circuit stretched the law to strike these plans down when it ruled that Texas had standing, the kind of \u201cconcrete\u201d injury that the Constitution requires to bring a lawsuit. Since Texas law allows unauthorized immigrants with \u201clawful status\u201d to obtain driver\u2019s licenses, the 5th Circuit reasoned that the costs of issuing these licenses amounted to a concrete injury to the state.\n\nThe dissenting judge noted that nothing requires Texas to offer such licenses, and she quoted a 1993 law review article by future Chief Justice John Roberts arguing that a lower burden for standing when states sue the federal government would transform courts into \u201combudsmen of the administrative bureaucracy, a role for which they are ill-suited.\u201d The dissent argued that the majority\u2019s approach effectively allows \u201cthe states, through the courts, to second-guess federal policy decisions.\u201d\n\nTexas\u2019 argument also ignores precedent and a long history of deferring to the executive branch on immigration decisions. In 1999, the Supreme Court said that at each stage of the removal process, \u201cthe Executive has discretion to abandon the endeavor, engaging in a regulator practice (which had come to be known as \u2018deferred action\u2019) of exercising that discretion for humanitarian reasons or simply for its own convenience.\u201d Congress also granted the president explicit authority to establish \u201cnational immigration enforcement policies and priorities\u201d in 2002. A 2012 ruling authored by Justice Anthony Kennedy said the \u201cbroad discretion\u201d entrusted to immigration officials extends to \u201cwhether it makes sense to pursue removal at all.\u201d\n\nWithout nine justices, the Supreme Court could be unable to muster a majority in this case, leaving millions of families across America waiting for an answer.\n\n18 million women of reproductive age in 12 states\n\nThe Supreme Court is reviewing another 5th Circuit case this term involving Texas\u2019 targeted regulation of abortion providers, or TRAP, law. Eleven other states have similar laws, and together, these laws could limit access to constitutionally protected abortion care for the 18 million women of reproductive age in those states. Nearly 1 million women in Texas could live farther than 150 miles from a clinic that provides abortion services, thanks to a Texas law that requires clinics to both have doctors with admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and meet the same standards as ambulatory surgical centers.\n\nSince 2010, TRAP laws have become a popular strategy to attack women\u2019s reproductive rights by imposing medically unnecessary and often impossible-to-meet regulations on abortion clinics under the guise of protecting women\u2019s health and safety. In reality, these laws have one purpose: eroding women\u2019s reproductive rights by shutting down abortion clinics. Rights without access are meaningless for millions of women in states with TRAP laws.\n\nThe Supreme Court should find Texas\u2019 law unconstitutional because it erects an \u201cundue burden\u201d on women\u2019s right to abortion. Determining whether a burden is \u201cundue\u201d requires weighing the harm to women\u2019s rights against any benefits the law provides. When a federal court struck down Wisconsin\u2019s TRAP law, the judge found that the law\u2019s \u201conly purpose \u2026 was to restrict the availability of safe, legal abortion.\u201d\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg lamented that \u201cwomen of means\u201d in states with TRAP laws will have a right to an abortion because they can \u201cafford a plane ticket, a train ticket, or even a bus ticket.\u201d Abortion access should be available to all women, not just a wealthy few.\n\nOne hundred and thirteen female attorneys filed a brief with the Court describing their own abortions. One of the attorneys, a public defender, describes how she broke her family\u2019s intergenerational cycle of teenage pregnancy:\n\nIf I had not had an abortion, I would have never been able to graduate high school, go to college, [or] escape my high-poverty rural county in Oregon. \u2026 I have seen the effects of teenage motherhood for women in my family, my friends, and loved ones. I have seen all the dreams deferred, the plans derailed, the poverty endured.\n\nUntil there is a majority decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to settle this issue, the scope of a woman\u2019s constitutional right to an abortion will essentially depend on where she lives and whether she can afford to travel. Millions of women are waiting for certainty. Until then, some states will continue to respect women\u2019s constitutional rights, while others will keep eroding Roe v. Wade by making it virtually impossible for some women to access abortion care.\n\nHundreds of thousands of employees of religious institutions\n\nThe Supreme Court is also hearing a challenge to the accommodation provided to religious employers that object to the employer-provided contraception coverage requirement in the Affordable Care Act, or ACA. The lawsuit, Zubik v. Burwell, claims that merely requesting the accommodation, which would allow employees to access contraception coverage through a third party if their employer has a religious objection, represents a substantial burden on the employer\u2019s religious beliefs. The religious nonprofits in Zubik \u201cclaim that submitting a form stating that they have a religious objection makes them complicit in the government providing insurance coverage that they find objectionable.\u201d\n\nThe case could affect hundreds of thousands of employees of religious institutions and their families if these employers choose to assert religious freedom in order to justify exceptions to the law. More than 750,000 Americans work for Catholic hospitals alone. Lawsuits claiming that the contraception mandate violated the right to religious freedom were filed by more than 100 employers, 70 of which employ more than 9,000 workers in total.\n\nIn Hobby Lobby v. Burwell, the Supreme Court ruled that the ACA contraception mandate violated the religious rights of closely held, for-profit corporations, extending religious rights to corporations for the first time in history. The Court allowed closely held corporations to assert religious rights under federal law, and it decided that these newly created rights trumped employees\u2019 rights to the health care to which they are legally entitled.\n\nIf the Court puts the rights of employers above the rights of employees in Zubik, the consequences would stretch far beyond the millions of women who could lose ACA-covered access to contraception to the dependents of these employees.\n\nSince Hobby Lobby, businesses and individuals opposed to marriage equality have also asserted religious freedom to justify discriminating against LGBT individuals and others whose lives they find objectionable. The Center for American Progress argues that \u201coverly broad religious exemptions that impose costs on third parties \u2026 are false protectors of religious liberty and cause significant harm.\u201d\n\nEight out of the nine circuit courts that have considered these lawsuits rejected the claim that merely signing the accommodation form violates an employer\u2019s religious freedom. But until there is a definitive word from the Supreme Court, nothing is certain. The rights of employees of religious institutions hang in the balance of an eight-member Supreme Court.\n\n1.5 million high school graduates of color each year\n\nThe issue of affirmative action is back before the Supreme Court this term in a case that could affect the millions of students of color who will graduate high school in the coming years. The Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education estimates that a little more than 3 million students will graduate high school annually for the next several years, starting in 2019. The commission also estimates that 45 percent of these graduates, around 1.5 million individuals, will be students of color.\n\nAlthough the 14th Amendment was passed to protect the rights of African Americans after the end of slavery, the plaintiffs in Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin argue that affirmative action violates white students\u2019 rights to equal protection under the 14th Amendment. The Court sent Fisher back to the 5th Circuit in 2013 and ordered it to examine the program under \u201cstrict scrutiny,\u201d the toughest standard for constitutional analysis.\n\nThe Court\u2019s conservative justices generally argue that the Constitution prohibits any race-based government decisions, even those made to ensure educational diversity or help students of color. Justice Clarence Thomas has even compared the arguments in favor of affirmative action to historical arguments for slavery and racial segregation. In 2007, Chief Justice Roberts said, \u201cthe way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\u201d In that case, the Court struck down school busing plans in two school districts that were de facto segregated but had not engaged in official Jim Crow-style segregation.\n\nAffirmative action helps level the playing field for students from historically marginalized communities, and in doing so, it ensures that the American dream of upward mobility is available to all. Other college admissions policies, such as those for legacy admissions, are less likely to benefit nonwhite students.\n\nBlack and Latino students are less likely to attend good high schools because of the severe inequities in school funding, and states that have banned affirmative action in college admissions have seen a dramatic decrease in college enrollment by students of color. The University of California, Berkeley experienced a 61 percent drop in admissions of black, Latino, and Native American students after the state banned affirmative action, and the University of California, Los Angeles saw a 36 percent decline. Within three years of Michigan\u2019s affirmative action ban in 2008, only 5 percent of first-year students at the University of Michigan were black, even though black students made up nearly one-fifth of the state\u2019s college-age population.\n\nThe Court will decide Fisher without Justice Elena Kagan, who recused herself because she helped defend the affirmative action program while working for the U.S. Department of Justice. If the vacant seat remains unfilled, a seven-member Court could decide the case or delay a resolution of the case yet again. Renowned American legal scholar Garrett Epps wrote that Justice Anthony Kennedy \u201cdoes not like affirmative action and has never voted to affirm it. On the other hand, he has a horror of the kind of bright-line opinion outlawing affirmative action the conservatives would favor.\u201d\n\n3 million voters in North Carolina and Virginia\n\nThe Supreme Court is reviewing lower-court rulings that redistricting maps in Virginia and North Carolina illegally packed black voters into certain legislative districts. In 2008, both Virginia and North Carolina voted for President Barack Obama thanks in part to record turnout by black voters. Since then, legislators in both states have passed laws that would disenfranchise and silence black voters. Reva McNair, a black voter in North Carolina, said that \u201cinstead of encouraging people to work together across traditional social divides, the [redistricting] maps segregate voters by race when they wind through communities.\u201d\n\nWhen politicians in these two states drew the now-challenged maps after the 2010 census, they used the Voting Rights Act, or VRA, as an excuse to pack black voters into certain districts. At the time, the VRA required states with a history of voting discrimination to ensure that voters of color can elect their \u201ccandidates of choice.\u201d Virginia politicians claim that this required them to increase the percentage of black voters in a congressional district to 55 percent, and North Carolina\u2019s legislature sought two districts with more than 50 percent black voters.\n\nBut the Supreme Court said last year that the VRA does not require \u201ca particular numerical minority percentage.\u201d Legislators must begin by asking how to maintain political influence for voters of color. Otherwise, a racial gerrymander might \u201charm the very minority voters that \u2026 the Voting Rights Act sought to help.\u201d The Virginia NAACP pointed out that black voters have always been able to elect their candidate of choice in the district at issue.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court ruling, Virginia moved more than 1 million voters into districts that were not drawn according to race. Legislators in North Carolina composed a new map that reassigns 2 million voters based on past voting history instead of race.\n\nThe new maps could again be reviewed by the Supreme Court this term, and the fate of these voters could rest in the hands of a short-staffed Court. With key elections happening this year, millions of voters are waiting for the Court to decide whether states can segregate them by race.\n\n75 million children and millions of unauthorized immigrants\n\nEvenwel v. Abbott, another redistricting case, could have a nationwide impact on how people count for purposes of political representation in state governments. The plaintiffs argue the Constitution requires that representatives be apportioned based on the number of eligible voters instead of total population\u2014a radical change in how legislative districts are drawn.\n\nA ruling for the plaintiffs would mean that legislators only represent actual voters instead of everyone in their district. Large segments of the population would become \u201cinvisible or irrelevant to our system of representative democracy,\u201d the Obama administration argued. Seventy-five million children would no longer be represented in state legislatures, which would lead to \u201cless access to critical resources, including quality education, health care, and services supporting children living at or below the poverty line,\u201d according to a brief from the Children\u2019s Defense Fund and others.\n\nThis change would have a disproportionate impact on communities of color, particularly Latino and Asian communities, in which more than half of the population is not eligible to vote, according to the Pew Research Center. An estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants would no longer be represented in state government. Although these people cannot vote, they deserve to be represented in America\u2019s democracy.\n\nFor decades, states have apportioned representatives by dividing total population by the number of seats to obtain roughly equal population across districts, according to the Court\u2019s \u201cone person, one vote\u201d rule. Thus, a lower court said the plaintiffs were \u201crelying upon a theory never before accepted by the Supreme Court or any circuit court.\u201d But if the Court cannot make a definitive decision, the future of \u201cone person, one vote\u201d will remain uncertain.\n\nMore than 7 million public employees\n\nIn Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, so-called right-to-work activists are attempting to harm public-sector unions\u2014which have strengthened the economy for everyone and helped build the middle class\u2014by directly threatening the economic security of more than 7 million public-sector workers and their families. This effort is part of a larger strategy to systematically limit the rights of workers and the unions that represent them.\n\nBecause unions are required to bargain on behalf of all employees\u2014even those who opt out of membership\u2014they are allowed to collect \u201cfair share\u201d fees from nonunion workers that go solely toward the costs of bargaining. Conservative activists are challenging these fees as unconstitutional, and a win for them would incentivize so-called free riders who benefit from union representation without contributing to the costs of bargaining.\n\nA Center for American Progress report assessed the impact of the decades-long decline in union membership and found that \u201cthe decline in union coverage accounts for 35 percent of the falling share of middle-class workers.\u201d Another report found that the children of union members have better health, earn more money, and obtain more education than the children of nonunion parents.\n\nIf an eight-member Court is unable to issue a final ruling, the economic security of millions of workers and their families will remain in jeopardy.\n\nConclusion\n\nMillions of Americans are waiting for the Supreme Court to settle important constitutional questions that will directly affect their families. Some of these questions could be decided by the Court this year\u2014but only if the Senate does its job.\n\nThe refusal of obstructionist senators to carry out their constitutional duty to consider Supreme Court nominees is unprecedented. The Senate has never denied a hearing for a Supreme Court nominee.\n\nIf Senate Republicans follow through with their threats of obstruction, it would damage the Court and its ability to answers the country\u2019s most pressing constitutional questions. But it would be even more damaging for the millions of Americans whose lives and livelihoods sit in legal limbo, dependent on an eight-member Supreme Court that may be deadlocked and unable to set precedent.\n\nThe framers of the Constitution intended the federal judiciary to be a stable body that ensures the rule of law by setting precedent that creates consistency and predictability across the country. They could not have imagined that so many senators would put partisan priorities above their responsibility to govern by holding the Supreme Court hostage. Millions of Americans are waiting for justice\u2014and waiting for the Senate to do its job.\n\nMichele L. Jawando is the Vice President for Legal Progress at the Center for American Progress.
