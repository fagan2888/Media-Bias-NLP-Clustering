Florida civil rights activists are calling on Duval GOP Secretary Kim Crenier to resign after she tweeted Monday night that officials should blast fire hoses at “thugs” in Ferguson, Missouri.

“A suggestion for Ferguson- fire hoses. Grt big fire hoses, serious water pressure. Kn0ck those thugs over. They probly need a shower anyway [sic],” Ms. Crenier posted on Twitter, a local CBS affiliate reported.

She later explained to the station that “when you put it into context, there is nothing sinister.”

But leaders of the local Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Jacksonville Progressive Coalition are not accepting her excuse.

“That’s insensitive, it’s racist,” said Pastor R.L. Gundy, of the SCLC. “To make a comment like ‘thugs’ you might as well call somebody [an N-word].”

Wells Todd with the Jacksonville Progressive Coalition told the station that Ms. Crenier’s comments have deeply divided the community.

“When you make comments like this, what you’re trying to do is divide the culture and divide the citizenry of the city along racial lines,” he said.

Ms. Crenier said the comments were her own personal opinions and that she was not speaking for the Republican Party.

“I’m not going to change their mind, but that’s my story and I’m sticking to it,” she said, adding that she has no plans of stepping down.

Duval County GOP Chairman Rick Hartley said Ms. Crenier will remain in her position. The civil rights leaders demand he step down too if he does not force Ms. Crenier to resign.
