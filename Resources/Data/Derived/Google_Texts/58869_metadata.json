But Salon points out one argument we had not heard yet:\n\nRepublican Rep. Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina voted against the Senate\u2019s debt deal in part because he somehow thought it provided funding to Joseph Kony, Ugandan despot and leader of the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army.\n\nA statement from Mulvaney said:\n\n\u201cFinally, the \u2018deal\u2019 is full of pork. A dam project in Kentucky got extra money; the state of Colorado got money to help with its flooding; and the \u2018Lord\u2019s Resistance Army\u2019 received special funds. Those may be worth discussing, but that will never happen now, as they were crammed into this \u2018deal\u2019 in order to help it pass.\u201d\n\nWhat Mulvaney is essentially saying here is that he\u2019d be totally into funding Joseph Kony if you\u2019d just let him discuss it first!\n\nActually, as notes, HuffPo, the bill provided funding for the Pentagon to fight against the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army.\n\nThat should give you some indication of the brainpower behind this shutdown effort.
