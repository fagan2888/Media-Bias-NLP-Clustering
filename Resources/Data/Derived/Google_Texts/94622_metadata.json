The products included fruit, cereals, mayonnaise and tinned fish \u2013 types of foods where errors have been spotted in the past.\n\nHave you spotted any incorrect unit prices on Tesco\u2019s, or any other shop\u2019s, website? If so, let us know by leaving a comment on our Which? Conversation unit pricing post.\n\nMisleading Tesco fruit\n\nStrawberries were a baffling case \u2013 of two 400g punnets, the cheaper one was listed as having a higher unit price. 400g of Tesco British Strawberries costs \u00a32, so is clearly pricier than 400g of Tesco Everyday Value Strawberries costing \u00a31.75. But the former was listed at \u00a35.72/kg and the Everyday Value pack at \u00a35.84/kg. The correct unit prices should have been \u00a35/kg and \u00a34.38/kg, respectively.\n\nIn some cases, products were listed as cheaper than they actually were. A 150g punnet of Tesco Finest Raspberries costing \u00a33 was priced at \u00a315/kg, but the actual cost was \u00a320/kg. A 125g punnet of Tesco Organic Raspberries for \u00a32.50 was displayed as costing \u00a316.67/kg - the correct price is also \u00a320/kg.\n\nTesco must fix errors\n\nWe asked Tesco why there were so many errors, and how it calculated the unit prices on its website. It said: 'We\u2019re urgently addressing these technical issues and would like to reassure customers that no one would have been charged more than the item price for any product they\u2019ve bought on tesco.com.'\n\nThough supermarkets have committed to making unit pricing clearer, there's no excuse for unit prices being completely wrong. We\u2019ll be checking back to make sure that Tesco corrects these errors \u2013 and will take further action on this issue if it doesn\u2019t.\n\nMore on this...", "article_metadata": {"description": "A number of the unit prices on Tesco\u2019s website are incorrect and could cause consumers to unknowingly buy a more expensive product, Which? has found.", "sectionName": "News", "og": {"url": "http://www.which.co.uk/news/2014/06/unit-prices-on-tesco-website-misleading-customers-371245/", "image": "http://www.staticwhich.co.uk/media/images/in-content/tesco-finest-raspberries-371252.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "A number of the unit prices on Tesco\u2019s website are incorrect and could cause consumers to unknowingly buy a more expensive product, Which? has found."}, "contentId": 371245, "robots": "NOODP", "categoryId": 213176, "omniturePageName": "home: news: 2014: June: unit prices on tesco website misleading customers, 23 June 2014", "fb": {"pages": 141323599261898}, "timestamp": 160525134348, "omniturePageType": "news", "categoryIds": "191885,294372,305418,", "categories": "news,which?-home", "omnitureAccount": "whichdev"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf8ae\"", "article_summary": "Unit prices on Tesco website misleading customers Which?\nTesco must fix errorsWe asked Tesco why there were so many errors, and how it calculated the unit prices on its website.\nThough supermarkets have committed to making unit pricing clearer, there's no excuse for unit prices being completely wrong.\nHave you spotted any incorrect unit prices on Tesco\u2019s, or any other shop\u2019s, website?\nWe checked the unit prices on 127 products on the site, and found a quarter were incorrect."}
