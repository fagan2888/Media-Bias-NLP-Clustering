A barricade situation in Chicago's Belmont Heights neighborhood ended without any injuries at about 10 a.m., Cmdr. Maria Pena said.

Pena said authorities responded to the 3000 block of North Harlem Avenue at about 6:20 a.m. after getting called about a man with a gun. She said the man, whose name she did not reveal, had kicked his wife out of the apartment but remained inside with two small children, ages 4 and 9 years.

The man came out with the children after "several conversations," she said, and was taken into custody.

Emergency personnel checked the children, a boy and a girl, to make sure they were OK.

A handgun was recovered at the scene, Pena said.
