These are firms with 50 or fewer employees, those exempted from the individual mandate.\n\n\u2014 Obamacare exchanges in disarray months before rollout: The Washington Examiner reports this morning that a senior Department of Health and Human Services official warned in May of serious problems with the Obamacare exchanges. \u201cA senior Health and Human Services official was so frustrated last May over the White House\u2019s \u2018disarray\u2019 on health care before the launch of Obamacare insurance exchanges that he warned of needing a \u2018come to Jesus meeting\u2019 with his counterparts,\u201d reports the Examiner. \u201cThe comment from Anton Gunn, then-HHS director of external affairs, came in an email exchange with Anne Filipic, the president of the outside group Enroll America, a nonprofit with close ties to the White House that was formed to promote the fall Obamacare rollout and boost enrollment \u2014 an effort the two were working on closely.\u201d\n\n\u2014 HHS wants to monitor your tweets: Gah! What is it with government? It\u2019s not like the NSA is retaining data on us or anything, now the Department of Health and Human Services wants a real-time look at social media accounts. \u201cThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is seeking a \u2018social media analytic tool\u2019 that will give the government access to \u2018full Twitter historical data,\u2019 according to a solicitation released on Tuesday,\u201d the Free Beacon notes. \u201cThe agency requires an archive that goes back at least five years of \u2018full Twitter historical data.\u2019 The government will also need \u2018access to multiple account log-ins,\u2019 \u2018real-time alerting,\u2019 the \u2018ability to construct lengthy Boolean searches,\u2019 and a function that can filter search results based on the location of a Twitter user.\u201d So\u2026more snooping and you\u2019re footing the bill.\n\n\u2014 Keystone XL and property rights: There are many arguments against Keystone XL, though most of them are based on misguided radical environmentalist dogma, but Tim Carney has brought up one that supporters of the oil pipeline should strongly consider. \u201cIf somebody else is trying to build something literally through your back yard, shouldn\u2019t you have the right to say no?\u201d wrote Carney at the Washington Examiner. \u201cAnd from north to south, that\u2019s exactly what Keystone XL\u2019s owners are doing: working with state governments to use eminent domain and force reluctant landowners to allow the pipeline through their property.\u201d Let\u2019s remember that property rights are the cornerstone of freedom, making Keystone XL not as cut and dry as some, including this author, would like to believe.\n\n\u2014 Defense spending cuts a step in the right direction: That what Christopher Preble of the Cato Institute argued after seeing media reports on the Defense Department\u2019s budget proposal. \u201cTrue, the Army will be smaller, declining from a post-Iraq high of 566,000 in 2011, to perhaps as few as 440,000 active-duty troops, about 40,000 fewer than the late 1990s average. But the force retains enormous capabilities across a range of contingencies. In the words of the senior Pentagon official, this \u2018very significant-sized Army\u2019 is \u2018going to be agile. It will be capable. It will be modern. It will be trained,\u2019\u201d noted Preble. \u201cThat sounds like the kind of force that Americans want and expect. Given rapidly rising personnel costs, and the great political difficulty of reining them in, the only way to achieve actual savings may be a smaller active-duty force. That is what Ben Friedman and I suggested over three years ago, and with this latest proposal, we might actually be heading in that direction.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Rise of the machines: Could an increase in the federal minimum wage lead to business investment into automation? James Pethokoukis warns that some industries may have no choice. \u201cAs MIT\u2019s Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, authors of The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies told me recently: \u2018There\u2019s no economic law that says everyone\u2019s going to benefit from technological progress, even as the pie gets bigger. It\u2019s possible for some people, even a majority of people, to be made worse off.\u2019 While some low-skill jobs might be automation proof, what about retail and fast food?\u201d wrote Pethokoukis. \u201cIndeed, Brynjolfsson and McAfee support helping workers via a greatly expanded [Earned Income Tax Credit]. Subsidize work, don\u2019t raise the cost of hiring.\u201d\n\n\u2014 GOP-connected lobbyist wants to ban openly gay football players: Sadly, folks, this story isn\u2019t from The Onion, nor did The Hill begin writing satire. Jack Burkman, a lobbyist connected to the GOP, is drafting legislation that would ban openly gay players in the NFL, saying in a statement that \u201c[i]f the NFL has no morals and no values, then Congress must find values for it.\u201d Sigh. Just\u2026stop.\n\n\u2014 War all of the time: That pretty much sums up House Majority Leader Eric Cantor\u2019s (R-VA) foreign policy views, as described in a recent speech. Conor Friedersdorf took a look at Cantor\u2019s speech and is, well, troubled by the themes. \u201cSo Cantor believes that the United States is paying insufficient attention to China, North Korea, and our Pacific allies \u2026 even as he insists the U.S. should still be fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, that the U.S. should have used more U.S. force in Libya, that it should be more involved in Syria\u2019s civil war, and that we should be prepared to wage war on Iran,\u201d wrote Friedersdorf. \u201cLittle surprise that he calls for more defense spending. We\u2019ve got the largest military in the world by a significant margin, but it isn\u2019t even close to big enough if we\u2019re going to fight at least four wars in a region that he doesn\u2019t even regard as our focus!\u201d\n\n\u2014 Pope Francis is against human progress: Though our religious friends, particularly those who are Catholic, may be fans of Pope Francis (and those who are not religious do like a lot of what he\u2019s saying in regards to controversial social issues), Marian Tupy of the Cato Institue and HumanProgress.org argues that the Vatican\u2019s animosity toward free markets and capitalism contradicts its desire to lift people out of poverty.\n\n\u2014 Ghostbusters is the best libertarian movie ever: Reflecting on the sudden death of Harold Ramis, Philip Klein argues that Ghostbusters is the best libertarian movie ever. Why? Because our four ghosthunting heroes took on the EPA. \u201c[T]he villain \u2014 a regulator from the Environmental Protection Agency \u2014 decides to interfere with the private business by cutting off their power, thereby releasing all of the captured ghosts. Here is the clip, wrote Klein. \u201cThe EPA agent orders the shut down of the ghost containment unit over the protests of Ramis\u2019 character, Dr. Egon Spengler, who says: \u2018Excuse me, this is private property!\u2019\u201d And Ashe Schow memorializes Egon (Ramis) in a meme.\n\nIf you work for a liberty-minded organization, think tank, or candidate, please send tips, news, or event information to jason-at-unitedliberty(dot)org.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "automation,Catholics,EPA,Eric Cantor,Foreign Policy,Ghostbusters,Harold Ramis,HHS,Keystone XL,libertarianism,minimum wage,NFL,ObamaCare,ObamaCare exchanges,openly gay,perpetual war,Pope Francis,property rights,Today in", "robots": "index,follow", "description": "&#8220;The great and abiding lesson of American history, particularly the cold war, is that the engine of capitalism, the individual, is mightier than any collective.&#8221; &#8212; Rand Paul &#8212; Small businesses to see health", "copyright": "(c) 2005-2013 United Liberty", "DC.Title": "Today in Liberty: HHS official warned of Obamacare \"disarray,\" Ghostbusters and libertarianism"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6bd4\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 Obamacare exchanges in disarray months before rollout: The Washington Examiner reports this morning that a senior Department of Health and Human Services official warned in May of serious problems with the Obamacare exchanges.\nIt\u2019s not like the NSA is retaining data on us or anything, now the Department of Health and Human Services wants a real-time look at social media accounts.\n\u2014 Keystone XL and property rights: There are many arguments against Keystone XL, though most of them are based on misguided radical environmentalist dogma, but Tim Carney has brought up one that supporters of the oil pipeline should strongly consider.\n\u201cA senior Health and Human Services official was so frustrated last May over the White House\u2019s \u2018disarray\u2019 on health care before the launch of Obamacare insurance exchanges that he warned of needing a \u2018come to Jesus meeting\u2019 with his counterparts,\u201d reports the Examiner.\n\u201cThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is seeking a \u2018social media analytic tool\u2019 that will give the government access to \u2018full Twitter historical data,\u2019 according to a solicitation released on Tuesday,\u201d the Free Beacon notes."}
