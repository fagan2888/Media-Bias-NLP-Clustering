Obama vows to bypass Congress on immigration

President Obama on Monday slammed Congress for failing to pass an overhaul of the nation's immigration laws, and announced that he would use executive actions to "fix as much of our immigration system as we can" starting by the end of the summer. Obama said he was directing immigration enforcement officials to focus on stopping a recent rise in the numbers of children crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally. "If Congress will not do their job, at least we can do ours," he said.
