Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) compared to the tepid crowds and poor honesty numbers for frontrunner Hillary Clinton.\n\nPanelist and author John Heilemann said the Clinton campaign should be worried about the numbers Sanders is drawing, such as the 15,000 people who came out to see him Saturday in Washington.\n\n\u201cYou cannot look at the enthusiasm for Bernie Sanders and not be worried if you\u2019re the Clinton campaign, and you can\u2019t look at her internal numbers, especially on honest and trustworthy \u2026 He could beat her in Iowa,\u201d Heilemann said. \u201cHe could beat her in New Hampshire.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s own campaign has acknowledged this possibility, something that seemed unthinkable when the race began. A recent poll showed Sanders just six points behind Clinton in New Hampshire, and Iowa is the site of Clinton\u2019s crushing loss to Barack Obama in 2008 that began the latter\u2019s catapult to the nomination.\n\nHeilemann said he felt Sanders couldn\u2019t beat Clinton in the long haul but added it would be terrible for her campaign if Sanders managed to top her in those early states.\n\nDemocratic strategist and Clinton supporter Donna Brazile acknowledged the impact Sanders is having.\n\n\u201cBernie Sanders is really hot,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s hot right now. Hot in terms of the passion of the Democratic Party, the passion of independents.\u201c\n\nShe went on to say she felt Clinton would re-gain the momentum she\u2019s lost since her announcement during the Democratic debates. The first one is scheduled for Oct. 13 in Nevada, and both Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley have criticized the lack of debate opportunities against the front-running Clinton.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Author John Heilemann says the Clinton campaign should be worried about the rise of Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary race.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "A constant theme of the 2016 Democratic nomination race popped up again Sunday on ABC's This Week: the massive enthusiasm for Democratic socialist Sen.
