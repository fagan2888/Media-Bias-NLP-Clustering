Compared to a year ago, the amount of federal student loans in default has increased by $15 billion.\n\nAs Jason Delisle, the director of the federal education budget project at the New America Foundation, tweeted, $121 billion of student loans have entered default.\n\n\u201cOver the past seven years, we have taken unprecedented steps to make college more affordable and to help borrowers manage their student loan debt,\u201d Secretary of Education John B. King, Jr. said in a press release.\n\nWhen looking into the data, however, borrowers have struggled to pay their loans. The $6 billion increase translates into almost 314,000 borrowers in default, a 19 percent increase from the previous quarter.\n\nDefault rates have fallen, but the amount has increased.\n\nEven the default rate improvement could be misleading. Borrowers aren\u2019t necessarily earning more; they\u2019re moving into income-based repayment options that lower their monthly payments. By December, income-based repayment enrollees increased 48 percent compared to a year previously, and 140 percent compared to December 2013. Almost 5 million borrowers are now in income-based repayment plans.\n\nThose plans have helped students avoid default, but the default rate decline doesn\u2019t mean that students have found better jobs or avoided financial hardship. Their position simply hasn\u2019t gotten worse.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to make more data available to shed light on student debt in America. As President Obama has said, \u2018Government should be transparent,\u2019\u201d King said.\n\nThe Department of Education, however, isn\u2019t admitting the deeper problem that their data show. It\u2019s \u201camazing spin,\u201d as Delisle said.\n\nIn a recent report from the Treasury Department, student loans have ballooned to 37 percent of government assets.\n\nDefault rates, delinquencies, and \u201chardship deferments\u201d have all fallen. The Department of Education isn\u2019t lying with statistics. However, by ignoring the underlying reasons behind those changes, they\u2019re misleading the public.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Shane Satterfield, a roofer who owes more than $30,000 in debt for an associate\u2019s degree in computer science from one of the country\u2019s largest for-profit college companies that failed in 2014, sits on the back of his pickup truck.
