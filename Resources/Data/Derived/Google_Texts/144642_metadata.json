That marked a third straight session decline for WTI oil.\n\nNovember Brent crude UK:LCOX5 traded on London\u2019s ICE Futures exchange fell 9 cents, or 0.2%, to $49.15 a barrel.\n\n\u201cOil is consolidating the sharp turnaround we saw early this week after last week\u2019s short covering rally through key resistance in the high $40s,\u201d said Tyler Richey, co-editor of The 7:00\u2019s Report. WTI crude prices climbed 9% last week.\n\nBut \u201coptimism around a renewed rally is fading as traders continue to eye a very healthy global supply situation,\u201d he said.\n\nTraders are in \u201cwait and see mode,\u201d he said, ahead of supply reports from the American Petroleum Institute due later Wednesday and the U.S. Energy Information Administration set for Thursday. Both will be released a day late this week because of Monday\u2019s Columbus Day holiday.\n\nAnalysts polled by Platts expect to see crude-oil stockpiles up by 1.8 million barrels in the week ended Oct. 9.\n\nU.S. production data will be key in the EIA report \u201cas the trend turned higher last week with the output figure in the lower 48 overtaking the 4-week moving average,\u201d said Richey. \u201cIf that continues, investors can expect more selling pressure in the near term.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. economic data were downbeat, which suggests weaker demand for energy. Retail sales barely rose and the producer-price index fell by a bigger-than-expected 0.5%. August business inventories were unchanged.\n\nOil is still in a downtrend, after WTI oil\u2019s rally from the August lows was halted last Friday at the 200-day moving average of $50.94, said Taki Tsaklanos, head of research at Secular Investor.\n\nFor now, crude oil is trading between its 50-day moving average at $44.73 and 200-day moving average at $50.94, he said.\n\nBack on Nymex, November gasoline US:RBX5 fell just over a half a cent to $1.308 a gallon, while November heating oil US:HOX5 rose 1.3 cents, or 0.9%, to $1.483 a gallon.\n\nNovember natural gas US:NGX15 tacked on 2 cents, or 0.8%, to $2.518 per million British thermal units.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Oil futures settle barely lower ahead of weekly U.S. petroleum-supply figures.", "creator": "@MktwSaefong", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CV898_crude__ZG_20141008072734.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Jenny W.
