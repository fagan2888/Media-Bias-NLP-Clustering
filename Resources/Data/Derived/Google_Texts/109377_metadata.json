Now Sheryl Sandberg wants us to \u201cBan Bossy.\u201d It\u2019s a word that undermines the ability of confident girls to reach their full potential as leaders.\n\nThe Facebook COO has launched a campaign with the help of Beyonc\u00e9, Jane Lynch, Condoleezza Rice, and Girls Scouts CEO Anna Maria Ch\u00e1vez to help us think twice about the \u201cother b-word\u201d and the biases beneath it.\n\n\u201cBossy\u201d is used to describe females four times more often than males, Sandberg explains, and has been in our language for over a century. Usage peaked when more women entered the workforce during the Depression era, and again during the 1970s. In short, it\u2019s a word used a lot when society feels threatened by women\u2019s progress.\n\nWe can debate whether we should rush to delete the word \u201cbossy\u201d from our dictionaries \u2014 and what word might take its place if we did. Or whether it\u2019s better to overcome the label than to banish it.\n\nBut we\u2019d be missing the point.\n\nThat\u2019s because the real takeaway from Sandberg\u2019s campaign is that labels matter. The subtext of \u201cbossy,\u201d \u201cpushy,\u201d and a host of other unflattering words for female leaders is often a deep-rooted gender bias that can inhibit the aspirations and achievements of girls and women.\n\nBy the time they reach middle school, for example, girls are less interested in leadership than boys are. Girls ages 8 to 17 say they avoid leadership roles because they\u2019re afraid of being labeled \u201cbossy\u201d or disliked by their peers, according to a survey by the Girl Scouts.\n\nAnd consider a study published recently in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that revealed clear gender discrimination in hiring for math- and science-related jobs. Three business school professors set up an experiment in which \u201cmanagers\u201d hired \u201cjob applicants\u201d to perform math-related tasks. In the first test, based solely on appearances, managers were twice as likely to hire a man over a woman. In a subsequent test, managers were shown hard evidence that the male and female applicants were equally skilled. They were still 1.5 times more likely to choose men. And here\u2019s an even more unsettling result: In a test where managers knowingly chose a lower performing candidate, two-thirds of the time they chose a male.\n\n\u201cMost leadership positions are held by men, so society continues to expect leadership to look and act male and to react negatively when women lead,\u201d Sandberg and Ch\u00e1vez wrote in a recent essay in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s why, despite earning a greater number of college degrees, women make up just 5 percent of Fortune 500 CEOs, 10 percent of heads of state, and 19 percent of the U.S. Congress, they add. What\u2019s more, at a time when the technology industry desperately lacks highly skilled workers, a recent survey reports that just 12 percent of the engineers hired by tech companies are women.\n\nMale-dominated industries \u2014 those with less than 25 percent female employees \u2014 face particular challenges when it comes to women\u2019s advancement, reports Catalyst. They are more vulnerable to pro-male biases when setting criteria for hiring and advancement, which can result in a less diverse workforce.\n\nIn contrast, companies with more female employees have distinct business advantages over their competitors, including improved performance, increased innovation, a healthier bottom line, and decreased turnover, according to a recent report from the Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology.\n\nSo while an all-out ban on \u201cbossy\u201d may not be practical, rethinking the labels we use for confident girls and women is definitely worth our time. As Sandberg and Ch\u00e1vez point out: \u201cHow are we supposed to level the playing field for girls and women if we discourage the very traits that get them there?\u201d\n\nPerhaps we can take a cue from Beyonc\u00e9, who simply states: \u201cI\u2019m not Bossy. I\u2019m the Boss.\u201d\n\nLisa Wirthman of Highlands Ranch is a frequent contributor to The Denver Post.
