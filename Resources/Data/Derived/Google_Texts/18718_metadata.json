They want to replace him with a \u201creal\u201d conservative, a \u201cConstitutional\u201d conservative, whatever that means, seeing as the people who espouse to be a Constitutional conservative show so little understanding of the actual Constitution.\n\nKen Cuccinelli (remember him? He wanted to ban oral sex as a Virginia gubernatorial candidate, which should give you a clue as to what the SCF means when they accuse someone of not being a \u201cConstitutional\u201d conservative), the President of the SCF, wants to recruit a new candidate to beat Senator McCain because he has allegedly dealt with Democrats. Not so much, but he did try to address our immigration problem in a somewhat reasonable fashion, and this won\u2019t be forgiven by the far right.\n\nFrom Mr. Cuccinelli of the SCF:\n\nJohn McCain (R-AZ)There are few Republicans who have betrayed our conservative principles more than John McCain. He wrote the McCain-Kennedy and \u201cGang of Eight\u201d immigration bills that offered amnesty to millions of illegal aliens. He voted for the Wall Street bailout, to fund the implementation of Obamacare, for the $600 billion \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d tax hike, and to raise the debt limit 14 different times! John McCain lost his way a long time ago and it\u2019s time to replace him with a strong conservative leader who will support and defend the Constitution.\n\nOf course money was involved in this play on emotions, as the SCF tells the reader that they need them to pledge financial support to McCain\u2019s conservative challenger if only they can find one.\n\nDoesn\u2019t Tea Party \u201cQueen\u201d Sarah Palin have a house in Scottsdale, Arizona? Or she did at one time, back when Republicans and the press seriously thought she might run for President in 2012. If Senator McCain\u2019s people think she\u2019s above that, they haven\u2019t been paying attention. Though to be fair, she\u2019s made it clear she\u2019s not here to work.\n\nThe SCF pledges to repeal Obamacare and claims to be pro-life while hilariously saying in the same breath that they exist to \u201cdefend the second amendment\u201d (aka, are NRA stooges). Defend it from what? Oh, never mind reality. The SCF also wants to abolish the IRS, which big business would surely appreciate \u2014 that is, until the roads went to crap, but too many big business leaders don\u2019t seem to think they should have to pay their part \u2014 that\u2019s your job, according to Republicans. The people should fund big business and subsidize them, so that big business will keep donating to Republicans. And so it goes. The SCF was started by former South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint in 2008.\n\nConservatives seem determined to hand the Senate back to the Democratic Party in 2016. We have seen the GOP\u2019s circular firing squad sabotage the party before. Republicans are already in fine form, showing off their penchant for self-destruction. John McCain has got to go, but the answer is definitely not replacing him with a Jim DeMint approved \u201cConstitutional conservative.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservatives seem determined to hand the Senate back to the Democratic Party in 2016, as they responded to John McCain's reelection announcement with a declaration of war.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Sarah Jones", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Conservatives seem determined to hand the Senate back to the Democratic Party in 2016, as they responded to John McCain's reelection announcement with a declaration of war.", "title": "The Republican Party Is Ripping Itself Apart As Conservatives Declare War On John McCain", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/04/07/mccain-announces-6th-term-conservatives-blood.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/John-McCain.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-07T20:33:10+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,Issues,Republican Party,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Republican Party", "published_time": "2015-04-07T15:36:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-07T20:33:10+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca6b4\"", "article_summary": "They want to replace him with a \u201creal\u201d conservative, a \u201cConstitutional\u201d conservative, whatever that means, seeing as the people who espouse to be a Constitutional conservative show so little understanding of the actual Constitution.\nSarah Palin\u2019s Tea Party is out to get her former top of the ticket running mate Senator John McCain again.\nJohn McCain has got to go, but the answer is definitely not replacing him with a Jim DeMint approved \u201cConstitutional conservative.\u201d\nThe people should fund big business and subsidize them, so that big business will keep donating to Republicans.\nFrom Mr. Cuccinelli of the SCF:John McCain (R-AZ)There are few Republicans who have betrayed our conservative principles more than John McCain."}
