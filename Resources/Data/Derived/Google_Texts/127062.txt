Zenefits — the upstart startup benefits company valued at $500 million after its last round of fundraising — is rolling out two more potential industry disruptors Wednesday in the form of Zenefits for Managers and Zenefits Business Intelligence.

The two products will be available for free, like much of the Zenefits software platform. The company makes money by acting as a benefits broker, a new model of middle entity between health insurance and payroll providers and employers.
