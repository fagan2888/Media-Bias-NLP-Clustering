The Island has 28 percent; citywide has 27 percent.\n\nCompare that to the best performing community district of Stuyvesant Town and Turtle Bay at 12 percent.\n\nWORK UP A SWEAT\n\nMid-Island adults seem to enjoy working out more so than the rest of the Island and city, with 81 percent of adults having had physical activity in the last 30 days.\n\nCompare that to Island wide \u2014 78 percent \u2014 and citywide \u2014 77 percent.\n\nIn the active community district of Clinton and Chelsea & Midtown, the best performing community district, 90 percent of adults said they have activity in the last 30 days.\n\nOBESITY IS HIGH, DIABETES IS LOW\n\n\n\n\n\nLOW RATE OF UNINSURED\n\nWith a citywide rate of uninsured adults at 20 percent, the South Shore is much better off, with 12 percent of adults having no health insurance, the same rate as Staten Island as a whole.\n\nThe South Shore is the best performing community district, with only 8 percent of people uninsured.\n\nThese numbers are from years before most major provisions of the Affordable Care Act went into effect in 2014. After, the percentage of people without health insurance declined to 14 percent citywide.\n\nGETTING DIAGNOSED FOR HIV\n\nWhile the mid-Island has had significantly fewer cases of HIV diagnoses than the rest of Staten Island and New York City, the data provided should be interpreted with caution due to a small number of events, the report said.\n\nIn the mid-Island, for every 100,000 population, there were 6.8 new cases, as compared to 11.8 Island wide and 30.4 citywide.\n\nLOW RATE OF STROKES\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP CAUSES OF DEATH\n\nLike the rest of America, heart disease and cancer are the leading causes of death in the mid-Island, Staten Island as a whole and citywide.\n\nHowever, death rates due to heart disease, lower respiratory diseases, drug use and accidents are higher than the city rates.\n\nLife expectancy is 80.3 years in mid-Island.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Staten Island, mid-Island, health, mid-island, news, tom-enterprise", "title": "Mid-Island health: Low child asthma, high adult smoking", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Mid-Island health: Low child asthma, high adult smoking\", \"link\": \"http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2015/12/mid-island_health_low_child_as.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.silive.com/home/silive-media/width620/img/latest_news/photo/19325371-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"17511734\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-12-05T12:08:30Z\", \"author\": \"Rachel Shapiro | rshapiro@siadvance.com\", \"tags\": [\"@mobile\",\"@river\",\"health\",\"mid-island\",\"news\",\"tom-enterprise\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.silive.com/home/silive-media/width620/img/latest_news/photo/19325371-standard.jpg", "creator": "@Writingrachel", "site": "@SIAdvance", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "While kids in the mid-Island are breathing easy, their parents are not as much."}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, December 06, 2015,  7:30 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.silive.com/latest_news/photo/allergies-6571f9e0ffbdd6a6.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"rachelshapiro\", \"author_nickname\": \"Rachel Shapiro | rshapiro@siadvance.com\", \"author_id\": \"12017825\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Staten Island Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "SILive.com", "description": "While kids in the mid-Island are breathing easy, their parents are not as much.", "title": "Mid-Island health: Low child asthma, high adult smoking", "url": "http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2015/12/mid-island_health_low_child_as.html", "image": "http://image.silive.com/home/silive-media/width620/img/latest_news/photo/19325371-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "SILive.com", "article": {"author": "http://"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, December 05, 2015,  7:00 AM", "article_author": "Rachel Shapiro | rshapiro@siadvance.com", "Description": "While kids in the mid-Island are breathing easy, their parents are not as much."}, "article_summary": "The city Department of Health and Mental Hygiene recently released its Community Health Profiles for 2015, highlighting health statistics for designated community districts.\nIt's one of only a few categories in the community health profiles that addressed children's health.\nCompare the mid-Island rate to Staten Island as a whole, which is more than twice the number \u2014 15.\nIn the active community district of Clinton and Chelsea & Midtown, the best performing community district, 90 percent of adults said they have activity in the last 30 days.\nCompare that to the best performing community district of Stuyvesant Town and Turtle Bay at 12 percent."}
