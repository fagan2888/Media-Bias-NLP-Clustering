On top of this, he has also scored four goals in a single match on three occasions for Madrid.\n\nRonaldo\u2019s latest scoring feat moved the Ballon d\u2019Or holder into fourth place on the Spanish league\u2019s all-time scoring list. His total of 231 goals takes him past Madrid greats Alfredo di Stefano (227) and Raul Gonzalez (228). Barcelona\u2019s Lionel Messi holds the record with 285.\n\n\u201cIn this case the numbers speak for themselves,\u201d said Madrid coach Rafa Benitez. \u201cI hope that Cristiano continues to score goals for both his benefit and ours. He could have scored even more today.\u201d\n\nMadrid bettered its 5-0 crushing of Real Betis from the last round - to go with a scoreless draw at Sporting Gijon in the season opener- before Barcelona visits Atletico Madrid later in a clash between the last two league champions.\n\nMadrid starts its Champions League campaign against Shakhtar Donetsk on Tuesday.\n\nRonaldo\u2019s first goal was set up by a long pass from Luka Modric, who spotted his run into the gap on the left flank. Ronaldo did the rest by slotting a right-footed shot inside the far post.\n\nGareth Bale set up three of Ronaldo\u2019s goals, starting with a spot kick after the Welshman was fouled by Alvaro Gonzalez in the area. Ronaldo fired in the penalty past outstretched goalkeeper Pau Lopez.\n\nBale then crossed for Ronaldo, who outmuscled Gonzalez and grabbed his third goal that put the result beyond doubt.\n\nBale also played a part in Benzema\u2019s goal in the 28th. Ronaldo received Bale\u2019s through ball and sent it across the goalmouth for Benzema to tap home. Benzema almost grabbed a second goal with a strike that hit the post two minutes before halftime.\n\nRonaldo was all alone to turn in Bale\u2019s pass in the 61st and take his fifth from substitute Lucas Vazquez\u2019s assist in the 81st.\n\nBoth teams wore T-shirts with the slogan \u201cSolidarity for the Refugees\u201d before the match in support of aid efforts to help refugees arriving in Europe.\n\nValencia also visits Sporting Gijon later, while Real Sociedad is at Betis.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals for Real Madrid for the second time in a 6-0 rout of Espanyol in the Spanish league on Saturday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals for Real Madrid for the second time in a 6-0 rout of Espanyol in the Spanish league on Saturday.", "title": "Ronaldo scores 5 goals as Madrid routs Espanyol 6-0", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/12/ronaldo-scores-5-goals-as-madrid-routs-espanyol-6-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/12/03cd495b0cd0ce29810f6a7067002da8.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/12/03cd495b0cd0ce29810f6a7067002da8.jpg", "description": "Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals for Real Madrid for the second time in a 6-0 rout of Espanyol in the Spanish league on Saturday.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Ronaldo scores 5 goals as Madrid routs Espanyol 6-0"}, "Author": "JOSEPH WILSON", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca7b3\"", "article_summary": "BARCELONA, Spain (AP) - Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals for Real Madrid for the second time in a 6-0 rout of Espanyol in the Spanish league on Saturday.\nRonaldo scored five goals for the first time in a 9-1 win over Granada on April 5.\nOn top of this, he has also scored four goals in a single match on three occasions for Madrid.\nHis total of 231 goals takes him past Madrid greats Alfredo di Stefano (227) and Raul Gonzalez (228).\nBenzema almost grabbed a second goal with a strike that hit the post two minutes before halftime."}
