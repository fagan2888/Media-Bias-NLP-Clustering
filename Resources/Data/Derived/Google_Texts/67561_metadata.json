Greenwald said he hopes the parties can work it out.\n\n\u201cThe state\u2019s role is if people resist,\u201d he said.\n\nBecause of the various sizes and strengths of municipalities and systems around the state, Greenwald said it would be difficult to handle the issue through legislation.\n\n\u201cFinding a balance is important,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could cripple the hospitals financially if they have to pay for the full value. On the other hand, if they pay nothing, then the burden on residents is significant.\u201d\n\nWhile municipalities are eager to benefit from settlements, the potential financial impact such settlements could have on the industry cannot be overlooked, said Michael Busler, an assistant professor of business studies at Stockton University.\n\nIf a hospital is viewed as a nonprofit, with no property taxes and no tax liability, it\u2019s a more attractive investment and it improves the cash flow of the hospital, allowing it to borrow at a reasonable rate, Busler said.\n\n\u201cIf the cash flow is decreased from property taxes, it becomes riskier for the investors,\u201d he said.\n\nWhich would be a big problem for systems.\n\n\u201cSome hospitals are barely making it,\u201d Busler said. \u201cIf you start adding taxes, and they are limited (by the Affordable Care Act) on how much they can raise rates, they might have to go under. It\u2019s a very serious threat. It adds a whole new level of uncertainty.\u201d\n\nAll of this comes at a time of great uncertainty and consolidation in the industry.\n\nVijar Kohli, portfolio manager at Golden Door Asset Management, said potential investment opportunities have played a role in mergers and acquisitions.\n\nNow it\u2019s in the IT departments, which have been lagging for years. Because of the requirements of electronic medical records, Kohli said health systems increasingly have needed to invest in overhauls of their IT systems.\n\nAll of this adds up to the uncertainty surrounding the industry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s yet another fiscal challenge for an industry already in the midst of an exceedingly complicated time,\" Managan said.\n\nBetsy Ryan, New Jersey Hospital Association CEO and president, said the industry has been getting ready for this moment.\n\n\u201cNJHA has been educating its members on the tax court\u2019s ruling and its potential implications, but no, we aren\u2019t advising them in any particular direction,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\"We\u2019ve formed a member task force to determine the best way to bring certainty to hospitals on this issue. We expect more than one bill to be introduced in Trenton, and we look forward to working with the Legislature and the Governor.\u201d\n\nRenee Steinhagen, with NJ Appleseed, said the settlement challenges the ways hospitals practice medicine, and is of special concern for physicians.\n\n\"it will be interesting to see if hospitals will move toward an employee-based system such as Cleveland Clinic, where doctors are (directly employed) not private practitioners,\" she said.\n\nThe model used by the clinic pays doctors through the clinic rather than allows them to remain small business which lease space within a health facility, or as in some hospitals, independent contractors.\n\nThe terms of the Morristown settlement were as follows:\n\nAtlantic Health will make the initial payment of $10 million, then pay another $5.5 million in penalties and interest in annual payments through the year 2025 to settle the years in dispute, 2006 to 2015.\n\nThe system also will begin making annual tax payments on 24 percent of the property, which was agreed to be valued at $40 million, through 2025. That will mean additional payments of $1.05 million a year for 10 years \u2014 making the total eventual tax payment more than $25 million.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NJBIZ", "description": "After Atlantic Health and the town of Morristown were able to announce a settlement regarding property tax issues that had been brewing since 2006, both sides had the same reaction.", "title": "Morristown hospital tax settlement figures to be first of many in the state | NJBIZ", "url": "http://www.njbiz.com/article/20151111/NJBIZ01/151119929/morristown-hospital-tax-settlement-figures-to-be-first-of-many-in-the-state", "image": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20151111/NJBIZ01/151119929/AR/0/AR-151119929.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "njbiz.com", "description": "After Atlantic Health and the town of Morristown were able to announce a settlement regarding property tax issues that had been brewing since 2006, both sides had the same reaction.", "title": "Morristown hospital tax settlement figures to be first of many in the state | NJBIZ", "image": {"src": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20151111/NJBIZ01/151119929/AR/0/AR-151119929.jpg"}, "site": "@njbiz", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "After Atlantic Health and the town of Morristown were able to announce a settlement regarding property tax issues that had been brewing since 2006, both sides had the same reaction.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Greenwald said towns and hospital systems around the state have had similar discussions since Tax Court Judge Vito Bianco ruled last June in favor of Morristown.\nAfter Atlantic Health and the town of Morristown were able to announce a settlement regarding property tax issues that had been brewing since 2006, both sides had the same reaction.\nBecause of the requirements of electronic medical records, Kohli said health systems increasingly have needed to invest in overhauls of their IT systems.\nThe system also will begin making annual tax payments on 24 percent of the property, which was agreed to be valued at $40 million, through 2025.\nThat will mean additional payments of $1.05 million a year for 10 years \u2014 making the total eventual tax payment more than $25 million."}
