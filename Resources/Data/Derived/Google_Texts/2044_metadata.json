But for the White House, the New Year\u2019s resolution on Millennials\u2019 minds should be to sign up for Obamacare.\n\nAppearing on Sirius XM Radio\u2019s \u201cThe Joe Madison Show\u201d on Thursday morning as part of the White House\u2019s blitz to market the Affordable Care Act, First Lady Michelle Obama capitalized on the holiday season and encouraged Millennials to sign up for Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThis act provides a safety net for millions and millions of Americans but we have to take the next step to go check it out, sign up and make sure that we\u2019re covered,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThat should be our New Year\u2019s resolutions to ourselves. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nAfter dismal enrollment figures for the months of October and November \u2014 a mere 365,000 enrolled in both the state and federal marketplaces \u2014 the White House began a marketing blitz to encourage consumers to sign up for healthcare through the Affordable. Care Act. The Obama administration projects approximately 3.3 million would purchase plans by Dec. 30.\n\nObama went on to note the importance of signing up for health coverage, telling listeners they should be wary of the consequences of falling ill when they don\u2019t have health insurance.\n\n\u201cPeople do think they\u2019re invincible and then they are hit by an unexpected medical emergency and they are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got bill collectors chasing them down right now.\u201d\n\nThe First Lady\u2019s appearance Thursday morning was the first of three radio interviews planned before the Dec. 23 enrollment deadline for consumers to receive coverage by Jan. 1.\n\nIn addition to radio spots, the First Lady and President Barack Obama met with mothers in the West Wing on Wednesday to explain the role they play in encouraging their families to be proactive with healthcare decisions. The White House has also joined forces with California\u2019s state exchange, Cover California, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Enroll America to promote a new campaign called \u201cTell a Friend \u2014 Get Covered,\u201d which includes celebrity endorsements and social media blitzes.\n\nFor the cost of premiums to remain low for all receiving coverage through Obamacare\u2019s exchanges, more than 2.7 million young Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 need to enroll. The White House, though, has yet to release enrollment figures based on age demographics. However, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said during a press briefing yesterday the administration didn\u2019t yet have access to such figures.\n\nh/t The Washington Examiner", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Lose weight, eat healthier and save money are often popular promises young Americans make to themselves as they ring in the New Year.
