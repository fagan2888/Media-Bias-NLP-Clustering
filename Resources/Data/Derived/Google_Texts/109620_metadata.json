Mitt Romney took the stage in Salt Lake City, weighing in with an anti-endorsement of Donald Trump. Two hours later, Chris Christie held a press conference in New Jersey. His message: Donald Trump is not holding me hostage.\n\nSarah Palin and John Kasich jumped into the fray, too. And Trump \u2014 as you might expect \u2014 also had something to say.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll this on an already big day for Republicans; the Fox News Channel Republican debate is scheduled for tonight in Detroit.\n\nHere are the moments of the day so far:\n\nMitt Romney speaks about Donald Trump\n\n1. Mitt Romney, elder statesman of the GOP, put it in no uncertain terms: \u201cIf we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished.\u201d He went on to indict Trump\u2019s business record, personal demeanor, foreign policy proposals, and more. Among his closing words: \u201cHere\u2019s what I know. Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. He\u2019s playing the American public for suckers: He gets a free ride to the White House and all we get is a lousy hat.\u201d\n\nJeff Zelevansky/Getty Images New Jersey Governor Chris Christie fielded questions at a news conference in Trenton, N.J.\n\n2. Chris Christie, speaking in New Jersey, reminded the world he was still governor of New Jersey, said he won\u2019t resign from that office, and asserted his independence from Trump. \u201cI am not a full-time surrogate for Donald Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cI am an endorser of Donald Trump. . . . I\u2019ve known him personally for 14 years, and I believe he is the best person to beat Hillary Clinton.\u201d Of the cyber-reaction Christie faced following his appearance at Trump\u2019s Super Tuesday address, Christie said, \u201cI was standing there listening to him. . . . No, I wasn\u2019t being held hostage. No, I wasn\u2019t sitting up there thinking \u2018Oh my God, what have I done?\u2019 \u201d\n\n3. Sarah Palin, moments after Romney\u2019s speech, posted a Romney attack ad on Facebook. The cuts of his record on amnesty, the Affordable Care Act, abortion, bailouts, and global warming might make you think that Romney is running in the 2016 campaign. Worth noting: The end of the video states \u201cPaid for by Donald J. Trump for President.\u201d\n\nCarlos Barria/REUTERS Republican presidential candidate John Kasich delivered a statement at a hotel in downtown Detroit, Mich.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. John Kasich lightly took on Trump at a press conference in Detroit. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to go and talk about the size of his hands or what kind of a tan he has, I mean, that\u2019s not the way to get this done,\u201d he said. Kasich walked out of his press conference nodding to Ohio. \u201cWe are going to go all-out to win Ohio,\u201d he said. \u201cI am going to win Ohio, plain and simple. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\n5. John McCain was more direct. In a statement today he said: \u201cI share the concerns about Donald Trump that my friend and former Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, described in his speech today. I would also echo the many concerns about Mr. Trump\u2019s uninformed and indeed dangerous statements on national security issues that have been raised by 65 Republican defense and foreign policy leaders.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump fires back at Mitt Romney\n\n6. And then there was Trump this afternoon. In Maine. Firing back at Romney. \u201cMitt is a failed candidate. He failed. He failed horribly,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat was a race [in 2012] that should have been won. And I don\u2019t know what happened to him. He disappeared.\u201d Of his endorsement of Romney, Trump said, \u201cI could have said, \u2018Mitt drop to your knees,\u2019 and he would have dropped to his knees.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.2679416670", "eomportal-id": 506715, "description": "Mit Romney, Donald Trump, Sarah Palin, Chris Christie, and John Kasich move on from Super Tuesday with attack politics on the agenda.", "eomportal-instanceid": 17, "og": {"site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "Mit Romney, Donald Trump, Sarah Palin, Chris Christie, and John Kasich move on from Super Tuesday with attack politics on the agenda.", "title": "First Super Tuesday, then Outrageous Thursday - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/03/03/first-super-tuesday-then-outrageous-thursday/ff4o6U3US7xeoBwbxkxjHO/story.html", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2016/03/03/BostonGlobe.com/Metro/Images/513533284[1]-11045.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Thu May 26 10:54:13 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "5bb40338-e18c-11e5-a6bc-eb92cca2d548"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd27a5\"", "article_summary": "Mitt Romney took the stage in Salt Lake City, weighing in with an anti-endorsement of Donald Trump.\nHis message: Donald Trump is not holding me hostage.\nSarah Palin and John Kasich jumped into the fray, too.\n\u201cI am not a full-time surrogate for Donald Trump,\u201d he said.\nDonald Trump is a phony, a fraud."}
