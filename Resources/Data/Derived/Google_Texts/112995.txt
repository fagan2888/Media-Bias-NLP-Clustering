The open enrollment period for health insurance doesn’t apply to Medicaid recipients, Nevada officials said on Thursday.

Open enrollment, which begins Saturday and goes through Feb. 15, applies to people signing up for subsidized coverage under the Affordable Care Act through the Nevada Health Link insurance exchange.

However, many Medicaid-eligible Nevadans will receive a form in the mail before March for redetermination of eligibility, said Miki Allard of the state’s Division of Welfare and Supportive Services.

People will need to complete and return the form within the specified time frame, she said.

Those who are no longer eligible for Medicaid after open enrollment for subsidized coverage has closed will still be able to join a plan.

They will have 30 days to apply through the Nevada Health Link for a qualified health plan, Allard said.

“We anticipate additional enrollment activity because people will be looking at the Affordable Care Act and some people will be eligible for Medicaid,” Allard said.

The Division of Welfare and Supportive Services also has a new call center to help with enrollment and answer Medicaid and welfare-related questions. The call center can be reached at 702-486-1646 or 775-684-7200.
