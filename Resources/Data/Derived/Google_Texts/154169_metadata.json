Bernie Sanders of Vermont in pledging to oppose cuts in the national retirement program and support an expansion of benefits for Americans across the board.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t cut Social Security,\u201d Clinton wrote Feb. 5 in a tweet in response to Sanders\u2019 criticism of her for hanging back in taking a tough stand. \u201cAs always, I\u2019ll defend it, & I\u2019ll expand it. Enough false innuendos.\u201d\n\nWhile Clinton\u2019s pledge didn\u2019t fully satisfy Sanders, her rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, she drew praise from the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and Social Security Works, organizations that had waged an on-line petition drive to convince Clinton to support efforts to expand Social Security benefits, according to the Huffington Post.\n\n\"This is a huge victory for American seniors,\" PCCC co-founder Stephanie Taylor said in a statement. \"Hillary Clinton took cuts to Social Security off the table.\u201d\n\nRelated: As National Debt Hits $19 Trillion, a Spending Showdown Looms in Congress\n\nMore striking by far was Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump\u2019s unconditional vow to oppose cuts in Social Security and Medicare during last Saturday night\u2019s GOP presidential debate in Greenville, S.C.\n\nTrump has shown a willingness to diverge from Republican Party orthodoxy on a host of issues, including trade and higher taxes on Wall Street hedge fund operators. He has chosen to take a populist stand on entitlement reform and promised again during the debate to oppose cuts in Social Security and Medicare and \u201ctake care of people on the street dying.\u201d\n\nPreviously Trump declared, \u201cEvery Republican wants to do a big number on Social Security, they want to do it on Medicare, they want to do it on Medicaid. And we can\u2019t do that. And it\u2019s not fair to the people that have been paying in for years and now all of the sudden they want to be cut.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line is that the nearly unstoppable Republican presidential frontrunner and the two remaining Democratic candidates are now essentially singing from the same hymnal on entitlement reform. That is an important development for the champions of expanded entitlement spending and bad news for fiscal conservative who fear a return to soaring budget deficits and debt.\n\nWhy the Working Class Is Choosing Trump and Sanders\n\nLast week, the Republican chairs of the House and Senate Budget Committees refused to allow Office of Management and Budget Director Shaun Donovan testify on President Obama\u2019s fiscal 2017 budget proposal because they said it wasn\u2019t serious enough about tackling the deficit.\n\nIf Congress and the White House remain on the current spending trajectory without addressing rising entitlement costs as more and more Americans retire, the deficit will increase sharply after 2018, spiking from 2.9 percent of Gross Domestic Product to 4.9 percent by 2026, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nBudget watchdog groups including the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said that while Obama should get credit for suggesting offsets for many of his proposed domestic spending initiatives in the final year of his administration, he missed an important opportunity to address entitlement spending \u2013 the long-term drivers of the deficit and debt.\n\nTrump, as usual, has been vague in describing his commitment to shield Social Security from cuts. Sanders and Clinton have been far more specific, including forcing higher income Americans to pay more into the system by raising the income cap on Social Security taxes.\n\nRelated: Can Bernie Sanders Steal Supporters from Donald Trump?\n\nAt present, the payroll taxes that fund Social Security are imposed on the first $118,500 of an individual\u2019s earnings. Sanders sponsored a bill that would eliminate the cap on earnings of $250,000 or more. By doing so, Sanders says he would both increase retirement benefits across the board and extend the trust fund\u2019s solvency.\n\nAccording to Clinton\u2019s campaign website, the former secretary of state and New York senator would \u201cpreserve Social Security for decades to come by asking the wealthiest to contribute more.\u201d She also vowed that she wouldn\u2019t attempt to address Social Security trust fund solvency \u201con the backs of the middle class,\u201d either through benefit cuts or tax increases.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Social Security advocates have quietly scored major victories on the campaign trail in", "title": "Democrats Promise to Expand Social Security Regardless of the Risk", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/16/Democrats-Promise-Expand-Social-Security-Regardless-Risk", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07132011_Social_Security_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/16/Democrats-Promise-Expand-Social-Security-Regardless-Risk", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07132011_Social_Security_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Social Security advocates have quietly scored major victories on the campaign trail in", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "At present, the payroll taxes that fund Social Security are imposed on the first $118,500 of an individual\u2019s earnings.\nSocial Security advocates have quietly scored major victories on the campaign trail in recent weeks that could have major implications for long-term efforts to control the debt.\n\u201cI won\u2019t cut Social Security,\u201d Clinton wrote Feb. 5 in a tweet in response to Sanders\u2019 criticism of her for hanging back in taking a tough stand.\nTrump, as usual, has been vague in describing his commitment to shield Social Security from cuts.\nSanders and Clinton have been far more specific, including forcing higher income Americans to pay more into the system by raising the income cap on Social Security taxes."}
