Although it is expensive, it could certainly pay off in the long run.\n\nTahlequah. June 2015 .\n\nAn officer shoots after an armed suspect opens fire. The suspect died, but the officer was cleared. Even though that officer didn't have his body camera on, another officer did. The video didn't show the actual shooting, but you can hear the shots.\n\nAugust 2015. Chickasha .\n\n\"Let me see your hands. Let me see your hands. Both of you. Let me see your hands,\u201d the officer said.\n\nAnother case that body cameras were in use involves an officer who wasn't forced to use his gun. However, you can see it pointed and ready to go.\n\n\"It's going to body cameras for pretty much every department across the country,\u201d Oklahoma County sheriff's office spokesman Mark Opgrande said.\n\nBut not for the Oklahoma County sheriff's office which is one of the largest agency in the state. It has had dash cams for years, and, now, the sheriff is looking into cameras deputies can wear.\n\n\"When we put dash cameras in our cars our complaints went down significantly over the first year, because we were able to have a true record of how that stop went down,\u201d Opgrande said.\n\nThe agency has been testing body cams since last year, but there is a lot to consider and a lot of money involved.\n\n\"How long to you keep it? What do you do with it once you get it? What do you do with the stuff that you get every day that nothing happened?\" Opgrande said.\n\nEach unit can cost anywhere from $300 to $1,000, but in the end could end up being another kind of weapon for deputies, not only in the field but in court.\n\n\"It provides a true picture of your interaction between the public and a law enforcement officer,\u201d Opgrande said.\n\nRight now, the Oklahoma County sheriff's office is testing different types of body cameras but may not buy them until late next year.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Following the lead of other law enforcement agencies, the Oklahoma County sheriff's office is looking to add body cameras to its gear.", "author": "Joleen Chaney", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/30816041/ok-co-sheriffs-office-looks-into-adding-body-cameras-to-gear", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9514486_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Following the lead of other law enforcement agencies, the Oklahoma County sheriff's office is looking to add body cameras to its gear.", "title": "OK Co.
