Now she is trying to bring such cruelty out of the shadows and into clear view.\n\nMadigan\u2019s office is drafting legislation, likely to be introduced in 2015, which would allow Illinois nursing home residents and their families to place cameras in their rooms to help protect them. \u201cResidents and family members should have the option, for their own peace of mind, to monitor what is taking place,\u201d said Madigan. \u201cIf something goes wrong, you can see what actually happened.\u201d\n\nRelated: Abuse and Neglect in Assisted Living Facilities\n\nIf the measure is approved, Illinois would join at least four other states\u2014New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and Washington\u2014that have laws or regulations allowing residents to maintain cameras in their rooms. In Maryland, cameras can be placed in a resident\u2019s room, but only if the facility permits them, according to state guidelines.\n\nThe nursing home industry isn\u2019t opposed to states allowing cameras in residents\u2019 rooms if they are being used as a way to ensure the delivery of quality care, said Greg Crist, senior vice president of public affairs for the American Health Care Association. The organization worries, however, that nursing homes could face higher staff turnover if employees decide to look elsewhere for a job where they aren\u2019t constantly under scrutiny. And it remains cautious about privacy issues.\n\n\u201cAs one law professor said, you\u2019re infringing on someone\u2019s privacy, arguably for their own benefit,\u201d Crist said. \u201cWe have to make sure it\u2019s justified.\u201d\n\nA Pervasive Problem\n\nWhile no one keeps data on the total number of allegations of abuse or neglect in nursing homes, an August report by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Inspector General\u2019s office found that 85 percent of nursing facilities reported at least one such allegation to the agency in 2012. It estimated that about 60,000 allegations involved staffers abusing or neglecting residents.\n\nRelated: Wrongful Deaths, Injuries and Errors in U.S. Nursing Homes\n\nSince 2000, at least a dozen states have considered some type of law or regulation allowing cameras in nursing home rooms to help detect and deter abuse and neglect, according to Amity Overall-Laib, a manager at The Consumer Voice, a national advocacy organization that promotes quality long-term care. The group operates a program that provides training and support to state and local ombudsman across the country. The ombudsmen are advocates for residents of nursing homes and assisted living centers who try to resolve complaints and press for improvements in the long-term care system.\n\nLegislative proposals permitting electronic surveillance have failed in a number of states. Some nursing homes and unions representing health care workers have voiced concerns about privacy violations, particularly if the equipment is hidden. And some advocates for seniors and family members have argued that cameras might be too invasive.\n\nBut the concept of privacy has been evolving, as boomers whose parents live in nursing homes demand more transparency in the digital age.\n\nOverall-Laib said her group supports a resident\u2019s right to decide whether to use audio or visual electronic technology. But it also believes that precautions must be taken. Among them: the resident\u2019s roommate should also consent and not be visible on camera; recordings should be the property of the resident or his representative; and family members who make a decision on behalf of an incapacitated resident should carefully weigh his right to privacy and autonomy before installing the equipment.\n\nRelated: How One Alzheimer's Family Sealed the Deal\n\n\u201cPutting in cameras is definitely an important issue,\u201d said Overall-Laib. \u201cAs long as the areas of consent and privacy are addressed, it should be up to the resident to choose one or refuse one. If the resident can\u2019t provide consent, if they have a guardian or a legal representative, then the state needs to have a very clearly defined process about consent.\u201d\n\nThe nursing home industry has pushed for a number of changes in state legislative proposals, such as requiring that the resident or family pay for the camera and that a sign be posted outside the door of the room, warning that electronic monitoring is in use.\n\nCrist said the industry doesn\u2019t believe that using cameras is a guarantee that residents will be protected and well cared for. \u201c(The cameras) should not be the be all and end all, in terms of ensuring quality of care,\u201d he said. Crist said that the industry doesn\u2019t track how much electronic surveillance currently is being used in residents\u2019 rooms. About 1.5 million people reside in nearly 16,000 nursing homes nationwide at any given time.\n\nVarying Requirements\n\nIn the handful of states that have created laws permitting electronic monitoring devices in residents\u2019 rooms, the requirements vary.\n\nIn Texas, the first state to pass such a law in 2001, the resident or guardian must pay for the equipment and a notice must be posted outside the room stating that electronic monitoring is being used. A nursing home may require that the device be placed in plain view, and cannot refuse to admit or discharge a resident because of a request to install a device.\n\nRelated: The Hospice Industry's Frightening New Failure\n\nPatty Ducayet, Texas\u2019 state long-term care ombudsman, said she thinks such devices are used infrequently in her state, but she supports a resident\u2019s right to install one. \u201cIt\u2019s no silver bullet,\u201d Ducayet said. \u201cBut I\u2019m all for preventing abuse and neglect, and this fits naturally with a person\u2019s right to oversee their own care.\u201d\n\nIn Oklahoma, which passed its law last year, a resident\u2019s roommate must also give written consent before an electronic monitoring device is installed, and the nursing home must accommodate room changes for the resident if the roommate refuses. It also must post a notice near the main entrance saying that electronic monitoring may be in use. Recorded footage from the device may be admitted into evidence in a civil or criminal court action.\n\n\u201cThis law is strongly pro-resident,\u201d said Esther Houser, Oklahoma\u2019s long-term care ombudsman. \u201cThe facility is not permitted to move the camera, obstruct it or retaliate against them for having it.\u201d\n\nHouser said that the law intentionally does not require that a sign be posted outside a resident\u2019s room. \u201cSenior groups argued that this is supposed to be a home-like environment. What\u2019s less homelike than putting a sign on a resident\u2019s door saying there may be a camera in use?\u201d she said. \u201cResidents also don\u2019t have to tell the facility where the camera is, so it can be hidden.\u201d\n\nRelated: What Retirees Fear Most of All\n\nHouser said that she \u2013 like many senior advocates - strongly believes that above all, electronic surveillance in nursing home rooms is a matter of personal choice. \u201cThere are wide differences of opinion about what is protection and what is an invasion of privacy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should honor those differences and give people the right to decide individually if they want video surveillance or not. It\u2019s America. We usually give people choices.\u201d\n\nActing on Their Own\n\nSometimes, family members who suspect that their loved one may the victim of abuse or neglect decide on their own to install surveillance cameras, or \u201cgranny cams\u201d in the nursing home room. In recent years, families in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and other states have captured alleged mistreatment on hidden cameras.\n\nState attorneys general in Ohio and New York also have used undercover video surveillance in residents\u2019 rooms (with family members\u2019 permission) to uncover abuse or neglect, resulting in arrests or indictments. While many advocates for seniors applaud efforts to crack down on the mistreatment of nursing home residents, they want to make sure that privacy and consent are carefully assessed in any discussion of electronic surveillance. They point out that residents may not just be videotaped eating and sleeping, but also being bathed, having their diapers changed and having consensual sexual relations.\n\nIllinois Attorney General Madigan, a Democrat who is running for re-election this year, said that she understands the concerns about the privacy rights of not only residents, but roommates, staffers and visitors.\n\nRelated: After Years, Americans Are Resigned to Surveillance\n\nBut Madigan, who has long been involved in initiatives to improve nursing home safety in Illinois, argues that video surveillance is everywhere nowadays, and that nursing homes should not be allowed to bar residents or their families from putting a surveillance camera in the room if they choose to.\n\nIn the last several months, Madigan said the issue hit home with her. An elderly friend who had broken his hip and been sent to a rehabilitation facility told her how poorly he had been treated there. Another friend complained about how her mother, who had suffered a stroke, had gotten subpar care in a nursing home.\n\nMadigan said that putting a camera in the room is an easy and inexpensive way to monitor a senior\u2019s care. She noted that the Illinois Department of Public Health gets nearly 19,000 calls a year about suspected abuse or neglect in nursing homes, and responds to more than 5,000 complaints.\n\nMadigan\u2019s proposal would allow video or audio monitoring devices in the nursing home room if the resident or family pays for and installs them. It would require both the resident and roommate\u2019s consent and would prohibit the facility from retaliating against a resident for using one. It would provide that recordings be admissible as evidence in a civil or criminal case, and would create misdemeanor and felony penalties against anyone who intentionally tampers with or destroys a recording.\n\n\u201cI have no interest in making someone\u2019s private life a reality show,\u201d Madigan said. \u201cThis really is about protecting people in nursing homes. Unfortunately, there are far too many stories about people who are not safe.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in Stateline, a nonpartisan, nonprofit news service of the Pew Center on the States that provides daily reporting and analysis on trends in state policy.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/25/Nursing-Home-Surveillance-Raises-Hue-and-Cry", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06112013_Dying_Senior_article.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Nursing Home Surveillance Raises Hue and Cry"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/25/Nursing-Home-Surveillance-Raises-Hue-and-Cry", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06112013_Dying_Senior_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0391\"", "article_summary": "The organization worries, however, that nursing homes could face higher staff turnover if employees decide to look elsewhere for a job where they aren\u2019t constantly under scrutiny.\nAbout 1.5 million people reside in nearly 16,000 nursing homes nationwide at any given time.\nLegislative proposals permitting electronic surveillance have failed in a number of states.\n\u201cThis really is about protecting people in nursing homes.\nSome nursing homes and unions representing health care workers have voiced concerns about privacy violations, particularly if the equipment is hidden."}
