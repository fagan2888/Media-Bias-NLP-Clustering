Such is the case this morning in the \u201cFocus\u201d section of Raleigh\u2019s News & Observer in an important story by Burgetta Eplin Wheeler entitled \u201cThe many agonies of our health care nonsystem.\u201d\n\nIn the article, Wheeler uses her own college-age son\u2019s recent and absurdly expensive experience in an emergency room to explain and expose the madness of America\u2019s dog-eat-dog, everyone for him or herself health care system.\n\nAfter documenting the crazy costs of his (insured) visit, she says this:\n\n\u201cA large reason it\u2019s this complicated, costly and exasperating is because we refuse to just cover everyone. The United States is the only developed country in the world that doesn\u2019t have universal health care. It\u2019s unfathomable that critics seem unwilling to acknowledge that they are paying for others anyway. They are paying for it in headline-grabbing higher insurance premiums. They are paying for it in $100 IV bags in the ER. They are paying for it in Affordable Care Act subsidies. And they are paying for it when a beloved son leaves $1 million in unpaid medical bills that must be absorbed in 100 hidden ways when a $1,000 colonoscopy might have saved his life had he been able to be insured. \u201cIn the end, we still pay for this care,\u201d Leslie Boyd said in a recent blogpost for WNC Health Advocates, an Asheville group she founded after the death of her son, Mike Danforth, from colon cancer at age 33. \u2018My son\u2019s surgeries, chemo and radiation cost taxpayers nearly $1 million, when we could have saved his life for about $1,000 a year. When you allow someone to go without needed preventive care and chronic disease management, they become very sick \u2013 and very expensive.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s, of course, must maddening about all of this is the blindness and disregard for facts that opponents of universal coverage continue to display. Here\u2019s Wheeler:\n\nAnd there\u2019s the crux. Even those who can\u2019t seem to summon up some compassion can appreciate that covering everyone simply cuts down on costs in myriad ways\u2026. In Britain\u2019s entirely nationalized system, the one with all of those No. 1 ratings, doctors work for the government and the hospitals are owned by the government. Like a lot of countries, it uses a value-added tax to fund social services, [the N.C. Health Access Coalition\u2019s Adam] Linker said, with the idea being to have a whole lot of people paying a little bit of tax on a whole lot of things. In other words, they pay for everyone\u2019s health care in small amounts when buying services rather than in ridiculous amounts in the ER\u2026. One way or another, we\u2019re all paying. The bottom line is that we are choosing to be a country that perversely prefers to spend $1 million on medical bills for the dying rather than $1,000 on a colonoscopy for the living.\u201d\n\nClick here to read Wheeler\u2019s entire story.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "The United States is the only developed country in the world that doesn\u2019t have universal health care.\nIn other words, they pay for everyone\u2019s health care in small amounts when buying services rather than in ridiculous amounts in the ER\u2026.\nSometimes, journalists do their best and most important writing when they share trials and travails from their own lives.\n\u2018My son\u2019s surgeries, chemo and radiation cost taxpayers nearly $1 million, when we could have saved his life for about $1,000 a year.\nIt\u2019s unfathomable that critics seem unwilling to acknowledge that they are paying for others anyway."}
