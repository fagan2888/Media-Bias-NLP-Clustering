But he gave it a shot, anyway.\n\nHe had promised Ted Kennedy he would. He had told those adoring crowds he would. Yes, he said, yes we can.\n\nYes we can have hope. Yes we can have change. Yes we will have health care for everybody, rich or poor. Yes we will have equal rights for all in the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave. We will let every American marry whomever he or she loves.\n\nHow\u2019s that for hope?\n\nHow\u2019s that for change?\n\nEven those four horsemen of the Apocalypse \u2013 Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and John Roberts \u2013 couldn\u2019t stem the tide of change sweeping the land with this intrepid President inspiring it.\n\nChief Justice Roberts joined the 21st Century on the issue of universal health care. Braving the sneering scorn of Scalia, Thomas and Alito, he ruled with Justices Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor in favor of keeping an essential provision of the health care law.\n\nHe is, after all, a conservative, not a Neanderthal. And in wording his judgment, he not only let Obamacare survive, he gave it some added muscle.\n\nBut that\u2019s as far as Roberts went. He balked at giving gays and lesbians equal protection under US law. Fortunately, his vote wasn\u2019t needed.\n\nToday, men can marry men and women can marry women, regardless of what state they live in.\n\nOf course the political waters rage and swell, the rhetoric of reaction rings out across the land. Republicans are furious. Scalia, Alito, Thomas and their ilk are spitting fire. In his bitter dissent to the health care ruling, Scalia (lower photo) called the majority opinion\u201dinterpretive jiggery-pokery.\u201d The gay marriage ruling, he said, was \u201cpretentious\u201d and \u201cegotistic.\u201d\n\nRight-wing media had stronger words for the justices responsible for the rulings \u2013 words like \u201cscumbag\u201d and \u201cdisgrace.\u201d The \u201cReligious Right\u201d called for fire and brimstone in the wake of the gay marriage ruling. And the mob of Republican presidential candidates joined in a Doomsday chorus lamenting both decisions.\n\nYes there will be rage. Yes there will be spite.\n\nBut yes we can have hope. Yes there will be change.\n\nClick for more on changing times and the Supreme Court.\n\nClick for Scalia\u2019s gay marriage dissent.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "George's Blog", "description": "It must be considered that there is nothing more difficult to carry out nor more doubtful of success nor more dangerous to handle than to initiate a new order of things.
