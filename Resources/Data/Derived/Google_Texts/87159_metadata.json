ACA could increase food stamp rolls\n\nRepublicans have another reason to hate Obamacare: It could grow the number of people on food stamps.\n\nThe Obama administration has ordered a study to determine whether the Affordable Care Act, by increasing the number of people eligible for Medicaid, will also increase the number of people enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program based on how states enroll people.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe outcome of the study could show an increase of 3 percent to 5 percent in food stamp recipients in some states from people who were already eligible for SNAP benefits but had not enrolled in the program \u2014 which could translate to millions or even billions more in federal spending, Greg Mills, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who is conducting the study, told POLITICO.\n\n\u201cSo in percentage terms, it\u2019s not going to be very large, but we\u2019re talking about a very large program,\u201d said Mills, who is investigating the effects of the health care law on SNAP on behalf of the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food Nutrition Service, the agency that monitors food stamps.\n\n( See POLITICO's full Obamacare coverage)\n\n\u201cIt would have a substantial financial effect.\u201d\n\nThe likely increase would come from a greater overlap in eligibility between Medicaid under Obamacare and SNAP.\n\nNearly all uninsured people now covered by the Medicaid expansion are also eligible for food stamps, but they are not all enrolled. Depending on how states put residents in these programs \u2014 many have integrated the process for SNAP and Medicaid \u2014 eligible food stamp recipients could be more easily targeted and encouraged to apply.\n\nTalk of a potential increase in food stamp recipients comes as House Republicans targeting SNAP insist it has become too bloated. House GOP members on the farm bill conference committee, already eager to make SNAP cuts, are ready to seize on the latest development during the negotiations that look to resume soon after last week\u2019s opening meeting.\n\n( WATCH: Obamacare timeline)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s troubling that three years after passage, we\u2019re still learning about new unexpected consequences from Obamacare.\u201d wrote Rep. Randy Neugebauer (R-Texas), who sponsored a bill to reform SNAP in the House, in an email to POLITICO.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be very interested to see a report on the interaction between SNAP and Obamacare,\u201d Neugebauer wrote. \u201cAs a member of the ag committee, we\u2019ve been dealing with the interaction between SNAP and other federal programs for years and I\u2019ve been a strong advocate for reforming the categorical eligibility provisions that allow individuals to receive benefits when they don\u2019t otherwise qualify for SNAP.\u201d\n\nDuring the negotiations, Neugebauer and other House Republicans will be defending the $40 billion in cuts over 10 years that are now contained in the House version of the farm bill, significantly more than the $4 billion the Senate\u2019s farm bill would cut over the same period, during the negotiations.\n\nMaking the issue more complicated is the $5 billion reduction in the program this fiscal year that went into effect last week when the additional SNAP dollars provided temporarily through the 2009 stimulus package expired.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Issa releases Obamacare 'war room' notes)\n\nEligibility for both \u2014 the new standard for Medicaid under Obamacare and SNAP \u2014 is based on what percentage of the poverty line the individual or household falls under. For Medicaid, that\u2019s individuals or families with incomes at or below 133 percent of the poverty level.\n\nSNAP data has typically been used by states to enroll residents in other programs, but with an influx of uninsured people now covered by the federal Medicaid expansion in 25 states \u2014 nearly all of whom are also eligible for SNAP \u2014 states can also proactively seek out eligible food stamp recipients through the Medicaid enrollment process.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Many states have integrated the process for signing up for SNAP and Medicaid.", "title": "ACA could increase food stamp rolls", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/11/obamacare-food-stamp-enrollment-99418.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2012/06/120619_food_stamps_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Medicaid (270),Food Stamps (52),Obamacare (877),Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (5)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Many states have integrated the process for signing up for SNAP and Medicaid.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb1ea\"", "article_summary": "ACA could increase food stamp rollsRepublicans have another reason to hate Obamacare: It could grow the number of people on food stamps.\nTalk of a potential increase in food stamp recipients comes as House Republicans targeting SNAP insist it has become too bloated.\nDepending on how states put residents in these programs \u2014 many have integrated the process for SNAP and Medicaid \u2014 eligible food stamp recipients could be more easily targeted and encouraged to apply.\nNearly all uninsured people now covered by the Medicaid expansion are also eligible for food stamps, but they are not all enrolled.\n( See POLITICO's full Obamacare coverage)\u201cIt would have a substantial financial effect.\u201dThe likely increase would come from a greater overlap in eligibility between Medicaid under Obamacare and SNAP."}
