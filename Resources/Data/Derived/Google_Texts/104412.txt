HOBOKEN, N.J. (AP) — Frank Sinatra’s first New Jersey driver’s license is on the auction block.

The Star-Ledger reports (http://bit.ly/TsSE8T ) the yellowed, text-only 1934 license was issued, typo and all, to Francis Sintra, 841 Garden St., Hoboken, New Jersey.

The license is signed by the 19-year-old Sinatra, whose eyes, of course, are recorded as blue. It was issued a year before Sinatra got his first big break in the music industry.

Also included is a 1940 letter to the state Commissioner of Motor Vehicles from the lawyer of a man who’d been involved in a car crash with Sinatra, insisting Sinatra’s driving privileges be revoked until he pays up.

Bidding had reached at least $2,500 by Tuesday afternoon for the items, which are being sold by the Boston-based RR Auction. Initial bids must be placed by 6 p.m. Thursday.
