Bernie Sanders of Vermont keeps chipping away at her delegate lead and continues to draw larger, more enthusiastic crowds than she does.\n\nRelated: Trump vs. Cruz Is Turning Into a Bare-Knuckled Bar Fight\n\nAnd while Trump and Clinton appear to have near insurmountable leads in their delegate counts, both could be tested at their national conventions this summer before they can lock up the nomination and face off in the general election.\n\nThe latest favorite political parlor game is guessing who would prevail in the general election campaign, and right now Clinton holds a decided edge. But there\u2019s an entire regular season of baseball between now and the November election, and bold predictions about the 2016 presidential campaign have been proved wrong repeatedly in the past.\n\nIn the latest Real Clear Politics averages of recent polling on hypothetical matchups, Clinton leads Trump by 11.2 percentage points \u2013 50 percent to 38.7 percent. Her lead over Trump in the general election was the biggest \u2013 18 percentage points -- in last week\u2019s Bloomberg Politics Poll.\n\nAs he frequently points out, Sanders, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, does better than Clinton against Trump in hypothetical matchups, with a 17.5 percentage point advantage. How well he would do against Trump in a general election in which he almost certainly would be mislabeled a \u201ccommunist\u201d can only be guessed.\n\nRelated: Trump Might Win the Nomination, but Cruz Won the GOP\n\nMeanwhile, Ohio Republican governor John Kasich \u2013 who so far has won only one primary, in his home state, and has almost no chance of being his party\u2019s nominee, beats Clinton in hypothetical matchups by an average of 6.5 percentage points, according to RCP.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s numbers are bad and getting worse,\u201d says J. Ann Selzer, the pollster who conducted the survey for Bloomberg. \u201cA majority of Americans now describe their feelings toward him as very unfavorable. That\u2019s a 13-point spike from November 2015.\u201d\n\nTrump seems nearly unstoppable as he continues to roll up impressive primary victories throughout the country, while Cruz and Kasich continue to believe that they can somehow deny him the nomination at an open convention.\n\nCruz managed to slow the Trump express slightly last week by soundly beating him in the Utah caucuses, while Trump easily prevailed in Arizona. The next big test will come April 5 in Wisconsin. If Trump wins there, too, it may be curtains for Cruz and Kasich.\n\nRelated: ISIS Propaganda Video Uses Trump Comments to Celebrate Brussels Attacks\n\nBut Trump\u2019s persistently high negative ratings \u2013 in the high 60s -- and mounting concern among Republicans and Democrats alike about his buffoonish and vulgar behavior are making Clinton look better and better, even while more than half of voters harbor deep suspicions and distrust for her.\n\nMoreover, Trump has a huge problem with women. A recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showed that 70 percent of women in both parties view him unfavorably.\n\nAnd despite Sanders\u2019s best efforts, it\u2019s almost a certainty that the Democrats will nominate the first female presidential candidate. Even with widespread distrust of Clinton over her mishandling of sensitive emails at the State Department and her close ties to Wall Street, many women won\u2019t hesitate to vote for Clinton over Trump, a notorious misogynist who regularly mocks the appearance of women, including Heidi Cruz.\n\nDoubts and fears about Trump as the next commander in chief are especially prevalent now in the wake of last week\u2019s terrorist bombings in Brussels. Clinton delivered an inspiring, thoughtful and calming speech at Stanford University, laying out her plans for combatting ISIS.\n\nRelated: How Clinton\u2019s Speech Capitalized on Disenchantment with Trump-Style GOP Foreign Policy\n\nBy contrast, Trump, in his shoot-from-the-hip style, was calling for closing the borders, torturing captive terrorists, targeting U.S. Muslim communities for special police patrols and cutting back on the U.S.\u2019s long-standing support of NATO to save money.\n\nWhile European allies are looking to the U.S. for leadership in responding to the latest terrorist attacks, they are being treated to the spectacle of Trump and Cruz bitterly fighting over perceived and real slights and threats to their wives.\n\nRick Tyler, Cruz\u2019s former press secretary, bemoaned on MSNBC Friday that the feud had sorely tarnished the Republican brand. \u201cThe whole world is looking to the United States for leadership on how to defeat terrorism and how to defeat ISIS, and what they are seeing are two leading presidential candidates in the Republican Party having this argument.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s a plus for Clinton and the Democrats.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only slightly fa\u00adcetious to sug\u00adgest that giv\u00aden the prob\u00adlems fa\u00adcing the parties and their lead\u00ading can\u00addid\u00adates, a placebo nom\u00adin\u00adee might well be do\u00ading bet\u00adter,\u201d political analyst Charlie Cook wrote in National Journal last week. \u201cWhile Ted Cruz is al\u00admost surely not the ideal Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan nom\u00adin\u00adee, he runs bet\u00adter than Trump, with Kasich do\u00ading bet\u00adter than either of the oth\u00ader two.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn\u00addeed, just about any non-po\u00adlar\u00adiz\u00ading Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan nom\u00adin\u00adee could do quite well against Clin\u00adton,\u201d Cook added. \u201cA Trump nom\u00adin\u00ada\u00adtion would seem to be the worst out\u00adcome for the GOP since he may be the only ma\u00adjor Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan fig\u00adure who can\u2019t beat Clin\u00adton.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "So let\u2019s see: Republicans Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are locked in an ugly, mudslinging", "title": "For Now, Democrats Savor a Clinton-Trump Matchup this Fall", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/27/Now-Democrats-Savor-Clinton-Trump-Matchup-Fall", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/01202016_Hillary_Clinton.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/27/Now-Democrats-Savor-Clinton-Trump-Matchup-Fall", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/01202016_Hillary_Clinton.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "So let\u2019s see: Republicans Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are locked in an ugly, mudslinging", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Her lead over Trump in the general election was the biggest \u2013 18 percentage points -- in last week\u2019s Bloomberg Politics Poll.\nIn the latest Real Clear Politics averages of recent polling on hypothetical matchups, Clinton leads Trump by 11.2 percentage points \u2013 50 percent to 38.7 percent.\n\u201cA Trump nom\u00adin\u00ada\u00adtion would seem to be the worst out\u00adcome for the GOP since he may be the only ma\u00adjor Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan fig\u00adure who can\u2019t beat Clin\u00adton.\u201d\nAnd despite Sanders\u2019s best efforts, it\u2019s almost a certainty that the Democrats will nominate the first female presidential candidate.\nAs he frequently points out, Sanders, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, does better than Clinton against Trump in hypothetical matchups, with a 17.5 percentage point advantage."}
