Translation, given Benghazi and that despicable video, and you can keep your healthcare plan and your doctor, and there\u2019s not a smidgen of corruption in the IRS, and Bowe Bergdahl served with honor and distinction. Do I need to keep going? But I want to believe the president. This is just too important, not only for us, but for our children and our grandchildren. There are two sides to every deal. How do we know if we can trust the other side? How do we know if we can trust Iran? But I guess that I don\u2019t have to worry because our president has us covered\u201d she stated.\n\nPirro added, \u201cthe Iranians tried to keep their underground fortress, Fordo, a secret from us and the rest of the world when they were building it. And assuming that inspectors can even find evidence of noncompliance, the resolution process would take so long, who knows what the Iranians would accomplish in that time? And why are the common folk in Iran jumping up and down? If it\u2019s such a great deal for them, why do I feel like it may not be such a great deal for us? Why do the optics look wrong? Why aren\u2019t we dancing in the streets celebrating? I do want to believe the president, but there are those who say this is simply a bad deal.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Judge Jeanine Pirro, host of the Fox News Channel's \"Justice with Judge Jeanine\" doubted President Obama on the nuclear deal with Iran.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Judge Jeanine Pirro, host of the Fox News Channel's \"Justice with Judge Jeanine\" doubted President Obama on the nuclear deal with Iran.", "title": "Pirro: I Can't Believe Obama on Iran - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/Pirro-44-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/04/04/pirro-i-cant-believe-obama-on-iran/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Judge Jeanine Pirro, host of the Fox News Channel's \"Justice with Judge Jeanine\" doubted President Obama on the nuclear deal with Iran.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/Pirro-44-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Pirro: I Can't Believe Obama on Iran - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Iran, Jeanine Pirro, President Obama,Breitbart TV, Middle East,Iran", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "President Obama", "published_time": "2015-04-04T19:04:11-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Middle East"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc13a\"", "article_summary": "If it\u2019s such a great deal for them, why do I feel like it may not be such a great deal for us?\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROn Saturday, Judge Jeanine Pirro, host of the Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cJustice with Judge Jeanine\u201d doubted President Obama on the nuclear deal with Iran.\nHow do we know if we can trust Iran?\nI do want to believe the president, but there are those who say this is simply a bad deal.\u201dFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u201cCommon sense tells you the decision to believe someone depends on prior experiences with them."}
