She was not reported missing for three days. For three days, nothing happened. Rumors have gone out suggesting one thing or another. But the truth is this: a freshman girl from Weston, Wisconsin, is missing, and no one knows where she is. Who is Mackenzie Marken?\n\nMackenzie is a daughter. She has a mom who is missing her.\n\nMackenzie is a friend. Her friends Fallon, Laina, Julia, Katie and Sarah have not stopped missing her.\n\nMackenzie is a student. She is a freshman at Mosinee High School.\n\nMackenzie is a child, with incredible value.\n\nWhile Mackenzie was never a part of my church, Good News Church of Mosinee, her story is incredibly important to us: We care for all the children and youth of our community. A child\u2019s level of involvement at Good News doesn\u2019t make them more or less valuable. She is created in the image of God, and that alone makes her special and valuable beyond comprehension. James 1:27 tells us that \u201cpure and faultless religion is to look after orphans and widows in their distress,\" and that is why we are concerned for Mackenzie. Not because of anything she could give us or any merit on her own, but because she is valuable in God\u2019s sight. In some circles, apparently, Mackenzie fell short on the \u201cpopular value scale,\" and she kind of flew under most people\u2019s radar. Can you imagine the national response if a Kardashian went missing? But in our own community a 14-year-old freshman girl has gone missing, which has garnered very little attention.\n\nIn our community, kids are in crisis; they are crying out for help. I wish there was a way to make everything right in the many situations that arise: the addictions to drugs, the failed communication in families, the mental illness that some live with. This is not Milwaukee or Chicago; this is Mosinee. A child from our community, Mackenzie, is in crisis, and we cannot let her be forgotten. At some point, losing Mackenzie means we have all lost something: the value of a human.\n\nIn response to something that is right at our door, Good News Church is sponsoring an effort to help find Mackenzie Marken. \u201cBring Mackenzie Marken Home\u201d will be held at 8 p.m. April 6 at Good News Church, 619 Marsh Drive, Mosinee.\n\nPlease remember Mackenzie today. But don\u2019t remember just her. Our noticing and seeing those outside our immediate circles is how our community is transformed to a place where everyone matters. It is when we start noticing that life begins.\n\nJoe Carlson is a pastor at Good News Church in Mosinee.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://wdhne.ws/1MHxmPJ", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Mackenzie Marken of Weston has been missing since Oct. 12, 2015.", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Herald Media", "description": "Mackenzie Marken of Weston has been missing since Oct. 12, 2015.", "title": "We cannot let missing teen be forgotten", "url": "http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/story/opinion/columnists/2016/04/01/we-cannot-let-missing-teen-forgotten/82518756/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/wausaudailyherald.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mackenzie Marken of Weston has been missing since Oct. 12, 2015.", "title": "We cannot let missing teen be forgotten", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/22525053dcc5360d84a89ef65eef1b839a4de258/c=0-18-491-509&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/10/26/WIGroup/Wausau/635814528043676410-WDHBrd-10-15-2015-Herald-1-A003--2015-10-14-IMG-Mackenzie-Marken-1-1-VBC8BCVL-L692559477-IMG-Mackenzie-Marken-1-1-VBC8BCVL.jpg", "creator": "@wausauherald", "site": "@wausauherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884268453", "fb": {"app_id": 187427251271455}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Mackenzie Marken, missing, teen, mosinee"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe13c7\"", "article_summary": "Mackenzie Marken (Photo: Archive)Last Oct. 12, Mackenzie Marken left her home.\nA child from our community, Mackenzie, is in crisis, and we cannot let her be forgotten.\nWho is Mackenzie Marken?\nBut the truth is this: a freshman girl from Weston, Wisconsin, is missing, and no one knows where she is.\n\u201cBring Mackenzie Marken Home\u201d will be held at 8 p.m. April 6 at Good News Church, 619 Marsh Drive, Mosinee."}
