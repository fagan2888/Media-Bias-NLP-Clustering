I\u2019m in the camp that says it should wait until we see wages rising at least at pre-crisis rates. The other side says that wages are a lagging indicator, and if it waits that long the Fed will be behind the curve.\n\nMy answer to this is that I\u2019m much more worried about a slide into a Japan-style trap of low or negative inflation than I am of a return to 70s-style stagflation, and that the big risk is that the Fed will tighten much too soon.\n\nOne thing should be clear: there is no sign of wage pressure. It\u2019s important not to pick and choose, highlighting whichever wage measure is going fastest. Jared Bernstein does this the right way, taking the first principal component of a number of different wage series \u2014 basically a measure of the underlying wage trend that is imperfectly captured by any one measure, but much better captured by looking at all of them. It looks like this:\n\nPhoto\n\nNo hint of wage pressure \u2014 and also no hint that we\u2019ve been closing the gap between actual and potential output.\n\nSo my plea to the Fed: hold your fire.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140614092744, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "June 14, 2014", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/You Can't Have A Wage-Price Spiral Without Wages ( 20140614 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "And wages are going nowhere.", "title": "You Can't Have A Wage-Price Spiral Without Wages", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/14/you-cant-have-a-wage-price-spiral-without-wages/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "And wages are going nowhere.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "June 14, 2014", "article": {"published_time": 1402752464, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2014-06-14T13:27:44-04:00"}, "utime": 20140614132744, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140614, "pdate": 20140614, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "And wages are going nowhere.", "title": "You Can't Have A Wage-Price Spiral Without Wages", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/14/you-cant-have-a-wage-price-spiral-without-wages/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/14/you-cant-have-a-wage-price-spiral-without-wages/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "You Can't Have A Wage-Price Spiral Without Wages", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s important not to pick and choose, highlighting whichever wage measure is going fastest.\nIt looks like this:PhotoNo hint of wage pressure \u2014 and also no hint that we\u2019ve been closing the gap between actual and potential output.\nOne thing should be clear: there is no sign of wage pressure.\nI\u2019m in the camp that says it should wait until we see wages rising at least at pre-crisis rates.\nThe other side says that wages are a lagging indicator, and if it waits that long the Fed will be behind the curve."}
