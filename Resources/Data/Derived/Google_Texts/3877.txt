California can’t catch a break. Amid its ongoing, devastating drought, it’s experiencing an unusually nast outbreak of West Nile Virus: 238 human cases, and 9 deaths, have been reported so far this year, compared to the 117 cases reported this time in 2013 and the five-year average of just 75. In Orange County, the epicenter of the outbreak, 90 people have so far become infected — seven times the number of diagnoses for all of 2013. State officials say they expect the outbreak will continue to spread.

Researchers have been warning that certain conditions created by climate change — increases in heat, precipitation and humidity — will be favorable to mosquitoes, providing ample opportunity for them and the variety of diseases they carry to multiply while their range expands. One invasive species, the Asian Tiger Mosquito, is already spreading rapidly — it’s invaded 36 states since arriving just a quarter century ago — and experts predict that, as climate change worsens, so too will its presence. In two decades, write researchers at the Public Library of Science, the land area covered by the pest may increase from 5 to 16 percent; as winters get warmer toward the end of the century, they could cover half the Northeast U.S.

But as California is proving, this isn’t the only way climate change could create a mosquito crisis. While the state has certainly seen its share of record temperatures this summer, it’s been making headlines for how little rainfall it’s received. But instead of working to suppress the propagation of mosquitoes, as we might expect, experts say the drought may actually be enabling the West Nile outbreak.
