Keo recently tweeted he was heading from Denver to his offseason home in Idaho.\n\nKBOI first reported news of his arrest.\n\nKeo gained notoriety when the Broncos signed him late in the season after he reached out to defensive coordinator Wade Phillips on Twitter. Phillips coached Keo with the Houston Texans and needed depth following injuries to safeties Darian Stewart and T.J. Ward.\n\nKeo played in four regular-season games with one interception. His biggest moment came in the AFC championship game when he recovered the New England Patriots\u2019 onside kick to preserve the Broncos\u2019 20-18 victory. He finished with two tackles in the postseason, and served as a backup punt returner.\n\nKeo could face a possible suspension for violating the league\u2019s personal conduct policy.\n\nTroy Renck: trenck@denverpost.com or @troyrenck", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos safety Shiloh Keo arrested on DUI charge in Idaho", "title": "Broncos safety Shiloh Keo arrested on DUI charge in Idaho", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/13/broncos-safety-shiloh-keo-arrested-on-dui-charge-in-idaho/", "image": {"width": 499, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160213__shiloh-keo-broncos-safetyp1.jpg", "height": 611}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160213__shiloh-keo-broncos-safetyp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-13T11:08:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T02:05:00+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Super Bowl 2016"}, "article_summary": "Broncos reserve free safety Shiloh Keo was arrested for driving under the influence in Idaho early Saturday.\n\u201cWe are aware of the matter involving Shiloh Keo and are in the process of reviewing it,\u201d said Patrick Smyth, the Broncos\u2019 vice president of public relations.\nKeo gained notoriety when the Broncos signed him late in the season after he reached out to defensive coordinator Wade Phillips on Twitter.\nPhillips coached Keo with the Houston Texans and needed depth following injuries to safeties Darian Stewart and T.J.
