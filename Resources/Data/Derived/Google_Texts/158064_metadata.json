(Nasdaq: GOOG) has purchased Timeful, a maker of scheduling software, as a means of expanding mobile services in order to attract more advertisers and users.\n\nThe Mountain View, California-based target is backed by AGrade Investments, Data Collective, Greylock Capital, Khosla Ventures, Kleiner Perkins and Pitango Venture Capital. Timeful will be integrated into Google's current offerings, including Inbox, Calendar and Docs.\n\nTimeful's application, which launched in March 2014, analyzes users\u0092 habits and priorities, and creates schedules accordingly. It works with popular calendar software, including iCal, Microsoft Exchange and Google Calendar.\n\n\"You can tell Timeful you want to exercise three times a week or that you need to call the bank by next Tuesday, and their system will make sure you get it done based on an understanding of both your schedule and your priorities,\" according a Google blog post. Timeful said current users will continue to have access to the app, but the developers will be focusing on new projects at Google. Timeful CEO Jacob Bank will serve as a product manager at Google.\n\nLike Google, Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) has also been busy buying up time management applications and technology. In February, the Redmond, Washington-based software giant bought Sunrise Atelier, the maker of a smart-calendar application for iOS and Android, reportedly paying $100 million. Previously, Microsoft picked up Acompli inc., a San Francisco developer of mobile email software.\n\nOther time-management applications may be ripe for the picking, too. One app developer is X.ai, which raised $9.2 million in January and $2.1 million in May 2014, with backing from Crunchfund, FirstMark Capital, IA Ventures and Softbank Capital, as well as Pritzker Group Venture Capital. The New York startup is developing an email assistant for scheduling meetings.\n\nFor more information on related topics, visit the following:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.themiddlemarket.com/news/tech_telecom/google-beefs-up-google-calendar-with-scheduling-app-timeful-256129-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.themiddlemarket.com/media/newspics/Timeful2.jpg", "site_name": "Mergers & Acquisitions, Latest News", "title": "Google Beefs Up Google Calendar With Scheduling App Timeful"}}, "article_summary": "Google Beefs Up Google Calendar With Scheduling App TimefulMicrosoft previously bought calendar program SunriseGoogle Inc.
