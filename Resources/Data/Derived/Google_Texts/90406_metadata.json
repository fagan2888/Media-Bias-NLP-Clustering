He also issued an injunction against the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from enforcing the mandate.\n\n\u201cThe courts have identified several \u2018less restrictive means\u2019 of serving the interests the government has identified than a total denial of the religious exemption request,\u201d wrote Rosenthal, who serves on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas. He identified a few different ways to provide contraception to employees without the mandate.\n\n\u201cThe result is to find and conclude that plaintiffs have shown both a substantial likelihood of succeeding on the merits of their claim that the mandate and accommodation substantially burden the plaintiffs\u2019 religious exercise and the absence of a genuine factual dispute material to this determination,\u201d he noted. \u201cThe government has failed to show that the mandate and accommodation are the least restrictive means of advancing a compelling government interest.\u201d\n\nIn granting the injunction, Rosenthal explained that \u201c[p]rotecting constitutional rights and the rights under RFRA are in the public\u2019s interest.\u201d\n\nThe contraceptive mandate would include coverage for the morning after pill, Plan B and Ella, which religious groups and business owners consider to be tantamount to abortion.\n\nThough this is yet another victory for religious freedom, this decision won\u2019t be the final word on the contraception mandate. The Supreme Court agreed last month to hear Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Stores. The respondent in the case has argued against the mandate on RFRA grounds.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "contraceptive mandate,contraceptives,HHS,Obama administration,ObamaCare,religious freedom,Religious Freedom Restoration Act,RFRA,Politics,News,Blog,Current,Alternative,Libertarian,Freedom,Election,Nonpartisan,Ron Paul", "DC.Title": "Christian colleges win court challenge over Obamacare's contraception mandate", "description": "The Obama Administration received another legal blow today over a controversial rule requiring that employers &#8212; including many faith-based schools and businesses &#8212; provide health plans that cover emergency birth control.U.S. District", "copyright": "(c) 2005-2013 United Liberty", "robots": "index,follow"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf2a6\"", "article_summary": "Though this is yet another victory for religious freedom, this decision won\u2019t be the final word on the contraception mandate.\nThe respondent in the case has argued against the mandate on RFRA grounds.\nHe also issued an injunction against the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from enforcing the mandate.\nHe identified a few different ways to provide contraception to employees without the mandate.\nU.S. District Court Judge Lee Rosenthal ruled in favor of two Texas-based colleges \u2014 East Texas Baptist University and Houston Baptist University \u2014 that challenged the contraceptive mandate on the grounds that it violated religious freedom protected under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA)."}
