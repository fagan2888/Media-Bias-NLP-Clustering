Henderson, NV (KTNV) - Demand for primary health care continues to grow in Nevada, and now patients in Henderson can look forward to a new medical center.

Dignity Health is expanding, and in a groundbreaking ceremony held Tuesday, officials talked about their focus on keeping healthcare convenient for their patients.

Dignity Health's first medical pavilion in Southern Nevada will open in Henderson. The center is located in a growing new health care corridor in Henderson, and will increase access to primary, urgent and diagnostic health care in an area of great need.

They wanted to develop a medical campus, somewhere their patients could go and walk from building to building, instead of driving across the valley.

With the Affordable Care Act making health care more accessible to patients, convenience is a top priority.

"The idea being that you shouldn't have to drive all over the valley to get all your lab tests or radiology," says Brian Brannman, the Senior VP of the Nevada Market with Dignity Health. "You can come see your physician and get it all in a one-stop shop, and we'll be as available to you as we can."

The medical pavilion is expected to create additional permanent health care jobs in the greater Las Vegas area.

The new medical center is expected to open within a year.
