A trio of men beat another man before one of them took his money late Friday night in southeast Wichita.

It happened at about 11:30 p.m. in the 4200 block of E Wilma.

Wichita police say the men began hitting the 47-year-old victim, before one robbed him of $32 cash. The victim told officers one of the men threatened him with a gun, then hit him in the head with it as the incident progressed.

The victim was taken to Via Christi St. Joseph hospital where he was treated for minor injuries.

Police do have names of all three suspects and are actively pursuing them, but have not released those names to the public.
