Welcome to Generation Obama:\n\n1. Brother, can you spare a job?\n\nIn July, the unemployment rate for 16- to 24-year-old increased from 13.3 percent to 13.6 percent; for 20- to 24-year-olds it jumped from 10.5 to 11.3 percent; and the unemployment rate for 25- to 34-year-olds rose from 6.5 to 6.6 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nGrads are so desperate for jobs that they are panhandling for them on street corners. Seriously.\n\n2. What the \u2026 ?\n\nIllegal immigrants get to chill out in suites with flat-screen TVs while 21.6 million Millennials still live at home with their parents.\n\n3. Obamacare Nightmare\n\nMillennials have to pay astronomical rates for full-coverage health insurance they don\u2019t need because Obamacare took away their choice to buy cheap, catastrophic-only coverage. Meanwhile, universities hike tuition and slash jobs to pay for the massive federal government mandate. One college student even had to go on food stamps in part because of Obamacare. Not to mention, ad campaigns touting the Nanny State program portrayed women as giddy sluts.\n\n4. Getting Screwed 101\n\nAccording to Congressional Budget Office findings, the government pulled in more than $50 billion in profit from federally subsidized student loan repayments last year. Meanwhile, the government keeps doling out more loans, easy-to-borrow funds that mean students are able to pay more, so universities keep charging more. Runaway tuition costs have outpaced national inflation rates. It\u2019s a Ponzi scheme, and it\u2019s only gotten worse under Obama.\n\n5. Minimum Wage B.S.\n\nObama goes around pushing a minimum wage hike as some sort of panacea for young people struggling to make it, when in fact they\u2019re the ones hurt the most by it. Read this and this.\n\n6. Welcome to Adulthood \u2013 That Will Be $100 Trillion Dollars\n\nA UC San Diego professor has pegged the national debt at nearly $90 trillion dollars, when the speculative \u201coff-balance-sheet commitments\u201d from Medicare, Social Security, student loan guarantees and other future federal government promises is factored in. Guess who will get stuck with that bill?\n\n7. New College Grads\u2019 Wages Are Growing Slower Than Everyone Else\u2019s\n\nLet\u2019s just add salt to the wound, shall we? San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank research found that little nugget to throw on top the heaping pile of Millennial gloom.\n\n8. They Live in a World Without Privacy\n\nBack in the day, you could live off the grid. Today, by collecting and storing every text, every email, every web search, the government knows everything about you \u2013 from whether you like jam on your toast to whether you\u2019re cheating on your spouse. Yes, the Big Brother Spy State has not in any way, shape or form shrunken under Obama, despite his campaign pledges to rein it in.\n\n9. Many Millennials Remain Misguided\n\nPerhaps the worst item on this list is that far too many young people blame the wrong thing for their depressing state. They\u2019re losing hope in America, not President Obama. Thankfully, a good amount of Millennials have stopped drinking that Kool-Aid.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ PREVIOUS EDITORS\u2019 CORNER BLOG ENTRIES.\n\nLike The College Fix on Facebook / Follow us on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The College Fix", "description": "It's not pretty.", "title": "Generation Obama: Nine Reasons Why It Sucks To Be a Millennial Right Now - The College Fix", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/frown.OrinZebest.Flickr.jpg", "height": 245}, "updated_time": "2015-05-28T17:28:43-04:00", "url": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/18675/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/frown.OrinZebest.Flickr.jpg", "description": "It's not pretty.", "card": "summary", "title": "Generation Obama: Nine Reasons Why It Sucks To Be a Millennial Right Now - The College Fix"}, "fb": {"admins": "672627547,1540010264,100009162449428", "app_id": 1559699120988871}, "article": {"section": "Editors' Corner", "tag": "unemployment", "published_time": "2014-08-04T01:59:50-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-28T17:28:43-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0271\"", "article_summary": "One college student even had to go on food stamps in part because of Obamacare.\nIllegal immigrants get to chill out in suites with flat-screen TVs while 21.6 million Millennials still live at home with their parents.\nSan Francisco Federal Reserve Bank research found that little nugget to throw on top the heaping pile of Millennial gloom.\nYes, the Big Brother Spy State has not in any way, shape or form shrunken under Obama, despite his campaign pledges to rein it in.\nMeanwhile, universities hike tuition and slash jobs to pay for the massive federal government mandate."}
