How does it feel?\n\nHow does it feel to be made a fool of? How does it feel to have the Republicans you elected, as a collective, place their thumbs to their noses and wiggle their fingers at you? How does it feel to once again be betrayed by those who promised you that things would be different with Paul Ryan as speaker of the House?\n\nAnd all of this time you thought it was the door-to-door snake-oil salesman and the Nigerian Internet scams you had to be concerned about. What Paul Ryan and his Republican liars did to We the People amounts to the biggest \u201cscrew you\u201d since Obama began his deconstruction of America.\n\nThe Obamas have turned being in the White House into the greatest welfare benefit in the history of subsidized living. Now, as they take their taxpayer-funded separate jets to Hawaii, to tack millions more onto the hundred million or more taxpayer dollars they have already misused living high on the old hog, Ryan makes sure Obama gets the Christmas gift of sticking it to the American people \u201cone mooorrrre time.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans led by Paul Ryan approved a $1.1 trillion funding bill in a landslide vote of 313-113. The omnibus spending bill included changes in Obamacare that entrenches it even more. The funding bill included $1.6 billion for the resettling of illegals and Muslims (terrorists) in America. Ryan, included ample money in the spending bill to allow for the building of a fence around his Wisconsin mansion, even though he gutted monies out of the bill that would have built the border fence Republicans promised nine years ago.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the spending bill also includes money to fund Planned Parenthood? After all, we don\u2019t to disappoint the baby-killers over the holidays.\n\nThe \u201cstick it to We the People\u201d gift Ryan and House Republicans laid at Obama\u2019s feet included everything but frankincense and myrrh. The Obamas eschew faux couture such as \u201cswaddling clothes\u201d in favor of suits for him by Hartmarx of Chicago (interesting that Obama would find a way to incorporate \u201cmarx\u201d into even a clothing line) and Michael Kors, Jason Wu, Narciso Rodriguez and Isabel Toleda, to name but a very few clothing designers for her.\n\nObama is a problem but the real problem is the Republican Party that smiles and drops their drawers for his every wish.\n\nHillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are the very least of the candidates we need to be concerned about. We need to be concerned about Republicans \u2013 and we especially need to be concerned about Republicans like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio.\n\nRepublicans sold the lie that if we would just help them secure majorities in the House and Senate, things would be different. The only thing that changed was the names on Republican office doors and Republican committee assignments.\n\nThis is why Karl Rove, Reince Priebus and even Obama himself fear a Donald Trump presidency. And while there is dispute pursuant to whether former Education Secretary Bill Bennett actually said it or not, the following is certainly no less valid: \u201cIt\u2019s no coincidence that everyone has gotten together to destroy \u2018The Donald.\u2019 It\u2019s because most of the other politicians are part of the good old boys club. They talk big, but they won\u2019t change a thing. They are all beholden to big-money donors. They are all owned by lobbyists, unions, lawyers, gigantic environmental organizations, and multinational corporations \u2026 like \u2018Big Pharma\u2019 and \u2018Big Oil.\u2019 \u2026 Or they are owned lock, stock, and barrel by foreigners, like George Soros owns Obama or foreign governments own Hillary with their Clinton Foundation donations.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s time to wake up, people. The \u201cinside the beltway\u201d Republicans are not our friends. As a matter of truth it would be hard to find a more vicious and single-minded group of enemies.\n\nI hope you are happy with your Christmas gift from \u201cRyan and company.\u201d For those who are saddened that Ryan\u2019s sleigh didn\u2019t contain more for Obama, I wouldn\u2019t worry \u2013 Valentine\u2019s Day is just around the corner.\n\nMedia wishing to interview Mychal Massie, please contact media@wnd.com.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"url": "http://www.wnd.com/2015/12/a-holiday-shafting-from-paul-ryan-co/", "type": "article", "site_name": "WND", "description": "It\u2019s Christmas, boys and girls, and you\u2019ve just been given the gift of a monumental shafting courtesy of your Republicans leaders, chief of whom is Paul Ryan.
