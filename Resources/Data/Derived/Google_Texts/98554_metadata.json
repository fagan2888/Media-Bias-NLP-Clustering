It could take the rest of the year to sort out winners and losers.\n\nThe court process could take six to nine months to play out, which would delay when patients could access the new beds. Check here for a list of the companies suing and the initial documents.\n\nAgency for Health Care Administration Secretary Elizabeth Dudek said 13 nursing home projects aren\u2019t being challenged, which clears the way for their construction.\n\n\u201cJust under 800 new beds, community beds, that will be brought online,\u201d Dudek said. \u201cAnd what\u2019s kind of exciting with that, there will be around 800 new jobs related to that that didn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nThe state approved new nursing homes last month for the first time in more than a decade. The state is expected to need 15,000 new nursing home beds in the next 15 years.\n\n-- Reporter Abe Aboraya is part of WMFE in Orlando.
