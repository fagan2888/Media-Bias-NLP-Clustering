Are American elders really sicker than those in other rich nations? Or are their illnesses just more likely to be diagnosed (or over-diagnosed) than elsewhere?\n\nThe mystery is deepened by another fact: As a group, the rising demographic of Americans over 65 are younger on average than elderly populations in the other 10 countries. But they\u2019re three times more likely to have two or more chronic conditions than those in the United Kingdom.\n\nAlso, American elders are 21 percent more likely to have multiple chronic diseases than those just across the border in Canada, and 40 percent more likely than Germans.\n\nWhat gives?\n\n\u201cFourteen percent of the U.S. population is over 65, versus 21 percent of the German population,\u201d study author Donald Moulds says. \u201cThis is really quite a difference, So the fact that we have a younger population with more chronic conditions is particularly alarming.\u201d\n\nAlarming, he says, because of what it means for the future of Medicare, the federal program that pays medical bills for the elderly and disabled, as the U.S. population continues to age. Already, nearly half of Medicare\u2019s $300 billion-plus budget is spent on the 14 percent of beneficiaries with six or more chronic conditions.\n\nThe new numbers come from a survey of nearly 16,000 over-65 citizens in 11 nations conducted by the Commonwealth Fund and published online Thursday by the journal Health Affairs. Other than the U.S., the U.K., Canada and Germany the countries studied are Australia, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland and New Zealand.\n\nMoulds says the study can\u2019t answer why American elders report more chronic illness than those in other peer nations. Partly it may be due to the spotty access to medical care that many Americans have had before they turned 65 \u2014 and before the Affordable Care Act began to expand coverage.\n\n\u201cIf you think about chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease, these aren\u2019t conditions that people wake up when they\u2019re 65 and suddenly get them,\u201d says Moulds, who is executive vice president of the New York-based Commonwealth Fund. \u201cThey develop over a lifetime.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s another way older American are worse off than their counterparts in developed countries. They spend a lot more out of their own pockets on medical care, despite having Medicare.\n\nOne reason: American elders are the most medicated among those in the 11 countries. More than half are taking four or more prescription drugs. In Switzerland and France, only 29 percent are.\n\nAbout one in five U.S. elders spends $2,000 or more out-of-pocket for care. The same proportion say cost deters them from care \u2014 from going to a doctor when they have a medical problem, from getting a recommended medical test or treatment, or from filling a prescription or taking medication as prescribed.\n\nThat\u2019s twice the proportion of seniors in most of the other countries who spent that much out-of-pocket or say that cost is a barrier to seeking care.\n\nAnd even though the United States spends far more on health care than the other 10 countries \u2014 often twice as much per person \u2014 American elders don\u2019t have equal access to care. Fifty-seven percent say they can get a same-day or next-day appointment for care when they\u2019re sick, compared to 83 percent in France and New Zealand, 81 percent in Germany and 65 percent in the U.K.\n\nOnly Canadians have worse access to routine care \u2014 45 percent say they can get timely appointments.\n\nWhen they do get seen, American elders are most likely to report that their care is poorly coordinated. Almost one in four say their medical records or test results were not available or tests had to be redone. They\u2019re most likely to say they\u2019ve gotten conflicting information from different doctors.\n\nBut there are some ways in which the U.S. system does better. American elders have the best access to specialists. Their doctors were among the most likely to counsel them about diet and exercise.\n\nAnd the U.S. system is ahead of others when it comes to end-of-life care. More than three-quarters of older Americans say they\u2019ve talked with their caregivers about the kind of treatment they want if they can no longer make decisions for themselves. And two-thirds have appointed a health-care proxy \u2014 someone authorized to make treatment decisions when they cannot.", "article_metadata": {"description": "American elders are 21 percent more likely to have multiple chronic diseases than those just across the border in Canada, and 40 percent more likely than Germans.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "American elders are 21 percent more likely to have multiple chronic diseases than those just across the border in Canada, and 40 percent more likely than Germans.", "title": "Mystery Ills: Are Older Americans Sicker Than Those In Other Countries?", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/11/mystery-ills-are-older-americans-sicker-than-those-in-other-countries", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/08/8378659933_5941c7a83b_b-620x413.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/11/mystery-ills-are-older-americans-sicker-than-those-in-other-countries", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/08/8378659933_5941c7a83b_b-620x413.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Mystery Ills: Are Older Americans Sicker Than Those In Other Countries?"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-11-21", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "date": "Fri, 21 Nov 2014 11:35:53 -0500"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca03a\"", "article_summary": "Mystery Ills: Are Older Americans Sicker Than Those In Other Countries?\nAre American elders really sicker than those in other rich nations?\nThey spend a lot more out of their own pockets on medical care, despite having Medicare.\nMoulds says the study can\u2019t answer why American elders report more chronic illness than those in other peer nations.\nOne reason: American elders are the most medicated among those in the 11 countries."}
