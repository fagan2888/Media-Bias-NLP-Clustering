Asa Hutchinson is set to meet Monday with federal officials in Washington to negotiate the future of the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion program, which leading Republicans say could be killed if it\u2019s not changed.\n\nNo state has seen its uninsured rate fall faster since the implementation of the federal health law than Arkansas, where it has fallen more than half, to 9.1 percent, from 2013 to 2015. Most of the credit goes to the state\u2019s decision to expand eligibility for Medicaid, which has provided coverage for around 250,000 low-income Arkansans who make up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 about $16,000 for an individual and $33,000 for a family of four.\n\nHowever, in a red state like Arkansas, dominated by anti-Obamacare lawmakers, the future of the expansion is politically tenuous. In 2013, Democratic Gov. Mike Beebe worked with a Republican-controlled legislature to craft a bipartisan compromise that became known as the \u201cprivate option\u201d: The state received a waiver from federal rules to use Medicaid funds to purchase private health insurance plans for most newly eligible beneficiaries, rather than placing them in the traditional Medicaid program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat waiver expires at the end of 2016, and Hutchinson \u2014 Beebe\u2019s Republican successor \u2014 is now seeking additional GOP-friendly tweaks to the program. Legislators are watching closely.\n\n\u201cMy read on the politics is that if the federal government does not consider out-of-the-box and unprecedented measures, there\u2019s a high likelihood that it\u2019s not going to have the political support to get through the Arkansas legislature,\u201d warned Republican state Sen. Jim Hendren, chairman of the state\u2019s health reform task force (and the governor\u2019s nephew).\n\nHaggling with federal officials over what is allowed in the Medicaid program has become a familiar dynamic in GOP-controlled states across the country. Since the 2012 Supreme Court ruling that upheld the Affordable Care Act but gave individual states the choice on whether to expand Medicaid, 31 states and the District of Columbia have accepted federal money to expand the program. Nineteen states have declined, leaving an estimated 3 million people in a coverage gap because they don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid or subsidies to buy private policies on the Obamacare exchanges.\n\nIn addition to Arkansas, leaders in Iowa, Indiana, Michigan, Montana, and New Hampshire have negotiated waivers to expand Medicaid that have included Republican-backed policy ideas, such as privatized schemes, wellness and work programs, and \u201cskin in the game\u201d in the form of cost-sharing or premiums.\n\n\u201cCMS [the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services] wants states to do the Medicaid expansion, so they have rolled up their sleeves and tried to get to yes on all these agreements, without compromising the fundamental integrity of the Medicaid program,\u201d said Joan Alker, executive director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Children and Families and an expert on Medicaid waivers.\n\nFor reasons both philosophical and political, Hutchinson hopes to negotiate further alterations. After the governor\u2019s one-day meeting with federal officials, they will likely continue to hammer out details in the coming weeks. If an agreement is reached, Hutchinson is expected to present it to the state\u2019s health reform task force on Feb. 17.\n\nHutchinson calls his proposed new policy \u201cArkansas Works.\u201d He described its framework \u2014 which would continue the expansion via purchasing private health care plans for beneficiaries \u2014 in a December letter to U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell.\n\nHutchinson\u2019s main requests are to charge small premiums or other cost-sharing for some beneficiaries, encourage employment and healthy practices, and make more use of employer-sponsored insurance plans. Medicaid-eligible beneficiaries who are employed and are offered insurance at work would be required to enroll in those plans rather than Medicaid. The governor would have Medicaid pay the difference in costs to beneficiaries as well as provide any Medicaid benefits not offered by the employer plan.\n\nHutchinson has made clear that he would like to establish work requirements as a condition of eligibility, but the Obama administration won\u2019t allow states to insist that beneficiaries have a job. The federal government is more flexible on ways to encourage employment, and under Arkansas Works, the state\u2019s Department of Human Services would refer unemployed or underemployed beneficiaries to job training programs.\n\nCertain beneficiaries, meanwhile, would be assessed premiums, likely around 2 percent of their income (at the poverty line, that amounts to $20 a month for an individual or $40 a month for a family of four). The governor envisions carrot-and-stick incentives to encourage healthy behavior. Those who follow practices such as visiting a primary care physician upon signing up could have their premiums waived; those complying with wellness and work referral requirements might also get additional vision and dental benefits not normally included under Medicaid.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a grab bag of the kinds of ideas that are being tossed around in the handful of states that are doing expansion by waiver,\u201d Alker said. \u201cThe risk is creating barriers to access to care for beneficiaries and creating additional bureaucracy.\u201d Most of the governor\u2019s requests \u201care in the ballpark of the kinds of things CMS has been negotiating,\u201d she said. \u201cI think on most of those issues, they will find a way.\u201d\n\nSome requests from Hutchinson may not fly with the federal government. One is a fee that would be imposed on beneficiaries with substantial assets \u2014 such as a house valued at $200,000 or cash-equivalent assets of $50,000 or more \u2014 in order to stay enrolled. \u201cThe governor feels like that\u2019s a common sense request, but there\u2019s going to be a lot of pushback on that,\u201d said Arkansas Surgeon General Greg Bledsoe, who is joining Hutchinson in Washington. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to get maximum flexibility.\u201d\n\nAsset tests for most Medicaid beneficiaries were explicitly banned by the ACA and Alker said it was unlikely that federal officials would cave on this point.\n\nPreviously, Hutchinson backed another controversial idea, a punitive \u201clockout\u201d provision that would bar beneficiaries from regaining coverage for six months if they failed to pay required premiums. The lockout provision is unmentioned in his letter to Burwell, however, and the governor has been cagey about whether it\u2019s still a request on the table.\n\n\u201cWe will not be a part of any provision that says you cannot have coverage because you are poor or because you can\u2019t make a payment,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Reginald Murdock, a vice chairman of the state\u2019s health reform task force. Murdock said that Democrats in the legislature were on board with the Arkansas Works framework as described in the letter to Burwell but would seek to block any changes to the private option that \u201cundermined the tenets of the ACA.\u201d\n\nWhatever the governor and the federal government agree to, if the legislature doesn\u2019t approve of the plan this spring, that won\u2019t just threaten health insurance for hundreds of thousands of Arkansans. It will also stop the flow of federal money paying for their health care. Under the health law, the federal government pays all the costs of Medicaid expansion for three years, with the states paying a small share in the future.\n\nAccording to a state consultant, ending the expansion would cost the state budget more than $400 million between 2017 and 2021 and cost hospitals $1 billion in uncompensated care expenses over the same period.\n\nThe state constitution requires a 75 percent majority of lawmakers in both chambers to approve continuing the expansion, a tall order for a controversial program. Hendren, who said he is prepared to walk away if he\u2019s not satisfied, acknowledged that if the expansion is not continued that would lead to \u201cpain in the budget, and there\u2019s going to be a lot of people who are upset if we have to make cuts. There\u2019s no question that the stakes are high.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Getty Images", "article_metadata": {"description": "No state has seen its uninsured rate fall faster since the implementation of the federal health law than Arkansas.
