Their arguments are superficially appealing, but they ignore the big picture.\n\nCompared to a normal economic recovery, the current one is characterized by too many part-time workers who are unable to increase their hours. A new report published in September by the Urban Institute and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation asserts that Obamacare does not explain the part-timers\u2019 predicament. It focuses on two observations.\n\nFirst, it notes that the increase in part-time work is fully attributable to an increase in involuntary part-time work. Perhaps we should celebrate this conclusion from Obamacare\u2019s supporters. Previously, some cheered the theory that Obamacare, which expands Medicaid eligibility and heavily subsidizes health insurance for middle-income households, would lead people to voluntarily reduce their working hours. In 2010, then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi encouraged people who wanted to be musicians, for example, to quit their jobs and focus on their (as yet undiscovered) talents, because taxpayers would underwrite their health coverage.\n\n(The Congressional Budget Office endorsed this approach last February, in a report that concluded the Obamacare insurance subsidies would \u201ceffectively boost the income of recipients, which will lead some of them to decide they can work less and still maintain or improve their standard of living.\u201d)\n\nIf the predicted blossoming of art and music is not happening, and people are showing they would rather try to earn higher incomes than indulge their muse, this is a testament to the American people\u2019s work ethic. Their choice, however, does not excuse Obamacare for making employers reluctant to offer more work.\n\nSecond, the September study notes that workers who toil fewer than 30 hours per week are not covered by Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate. However, part-timers who work more than 30 hours are suffering the same as those who work less. This leads the study\u2019s authors to conclude that Obamacare cannot be causing the slowdown.\n\nIt\u2019s important to recognize that the cost of Obamacare goes way beyond the employer mandate. Indeed, the current employment data are largely irrelevant to the debate over labor-market effects because the employer mandate has been delayed (although there is a \u201clook-back\u201d period that might have some impact). Even if the employer mandate had been imposed on schedule this year, employers look at health benefits as one piece of compensation. They would be free to fund the mandatory health coverage by cutting back their workers\u2019 hours. I expect many to do precisely this in 2015, when the Department of Health and Human Services is expected to impose the employer mandate.\n\nThe Urban Institute and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation believe the terrible employment picture is not caused by Obamacare, \u201cbut more likely due to a slower than normal recovery.\u201d However, Obamacare is hiding in plain sight as a cause of the slow recovery.\n\nEmployers themselves continue to tell us that they are cutting employment in response to Obamacare. In a survey of employers by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which asked specifically about the effects of Obamacare, 20 percent reported they expect to increase the proportion of part-time workers, but only 5 percent expected to hire relatively fewer part-timers. And about 22 percent plan to cut wages and benefits, but only 6 percent plan to increase them. With respect to benefits, 68 percent of business leaders plan to cut the range of services covered, or cut the size and breadth of their provider networks. Another survey conducted by the Philadelphia Fed reported similar results.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "John R.
