A comedian who runs a humorous \u201cGod\u201d Facebook page is behind the efforts, the news website reports.\n\n\u201cA mean lie has been put into the world for thousands of years. The time has come to right this wrong. God loves gay, lesbian and transgendered people. God loves ALL people! Therefore, the LORD shall put up a billboard in Topeka, Kansas, that says \u2018God Loves Gays.\u2019 The time has come to fight back. With love!\u201d reads the God Loves Gay People website.\n\nThe campaign was launched in opposition to the Westboro Baptist Church, according to the group\u2019s Indiegogo crowdfunding webpage.\n\n\u201cThe Westboro Baptist Church is a hate group based in Topeka, Kansas. This group protests at the funerals of soldiers, murdered children and more. They carry around with them hate-speech signs that say that God hates gay people,\u201d the fundraising webpage reads.\n\nAs of Thursday night, the group was less than $5,000 shy of its $50,000 goal, which would pay for a billboard for 12 months. If the goal is exceeded, the group will either keep the billboard in Topeka up longer or put billboards up in other states, the group said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fed up with the antigay, funeral-picketing ways of the Kansas-based Westboro Baptist Church, one group plans to fight back with a message of love and acceptance \u2014 a very, very big message.", "Author": "Jennifer Pompi", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Fed up with the antigay, funeral-picketing ways of the Kansas-based Westboro Baptist Church, one group plans to fight back with a message of love and acceptance \u2014 a very, very big message.", "title": "\u2018God Loves Gays\u2019 billboard campaign hopes to counter message of Westboro Baptist Church", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/19/god-loves-gays-billboard-campaign-hopes-counter-me/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/19/screen-shot-2014-08-19-at-94815-pm.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/19/screen-shot-2014-08-19-at-94815-pm.png", "title": "\u2018God Loves Gays\u2019 billboard campaign hopes to counter messa", "description": "Fed up with the antigay, funeral-picketing ways of the Kansas-based Westboro Baptist Church, one group plans to fight back with a message of love and acceptance \u2014 a very, very big message.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Religion Belief, Social Issues, Topeka, Westboro Baptist Church, Baptist"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca76c\"", "article_summary": "The campaign was launched in opposition to the Westboro Baptist Church, according to the group\u2019s Indiegogo crowdfunding webpage.\nTherefore, the LORD shall put up a billboard in Topeka, Kansas, that says \u2018God Loves Gays.\u2019 The time has come to fight back.\nGod loves gay, lesbian and transgendered people.\nWith love!\u201d reads the God Loves Gay People website.\nFed up with the antigay, funeral-picketing ways of the Kansas-based Westboro Baptist Church, one group plans to fight back with a cheeky message of love and acceptance \u2014 a very, very big message."}
