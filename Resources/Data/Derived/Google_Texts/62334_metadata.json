Those patients were automatically enrolled in a plan.\n\n\"Ultimately you want people to be choosing their plans and seeing which providers are in the network,\" said Laura Summer, a senior research scholar at Georgetown and author of the report.\n\nOther questions arose about billing and whether state Medicaid officials have too much on their plate, given the 2014 rollout of statewide managed care enrollment for other Medicaid patients -- low-income children, pregnant women, and others who are healthier than those in long term care.\n\n\u201cThe transition to a managed care system has the potential to improve quality and decrease costs, but more upfront investment and lead time are needed to achieve the ambitious goals Florida has set for its new program,\u201d Summer said.\n\nOther findings include:\n\nBeneficiaries weren\u2019t always notified that they need to select a care plan. Glitches, such as out-of-date addresses and incorrect enrollment timing, were to blame.\n\nEnrollment was cumbersome, with multiple calls needed to determine whether those who provide various services -- such as meals and personal care services -- were part of the new managed care plans.\n\nComplete plan information wasn\u2019t available in a timely manner on the program website.\n\nProviders are concerned that case managers, now working as employees of a managed care plan, will remain neutral rather than act as advocates for the frail and elderly patients.\n\nStaff from the Agency for Health Care Administration has been helpful in terms of the transition, though details about future operation remain cloudy.\n\nSo many people in long-term care are incapacitated, said Emma Hemness, a Brandon elder law attorney and member of the Foundation for LTC Solutions advocacy group. Family members or other caregivers need to be proactive in making decisions. Otherwise, the beneficiary could face unintended consequences.\n\n\u201cIf you are an advocate for a senior, you have to watch and you have to watch closely,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2026If a senior chooses a plan and the plan does not have a contract approved with that assisted living facility, it could mean the senior will either have to give up their Medicaid covered services or they have to totally move out of that facility that has been their home.\u201d\n\nAlmost 90,000 Floridians are eligible to participate in the state\u2019s long-term care program, which is delivered in nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and at home. The report said 58 percent of beneficiaries lived in nursing homes, and 42 percent were in community-based waiver programs. Another 40,000 were on waiting lists for Medicaid community-based services as of September, the report said.\n\nFour months ago, the state launched the first phase of its long-term care model, approved in 2011 by Florida\u2019s Legislature and authorized earlier this year by federal health administrators. A majority of the funds for Medicaid comes from the federal budget.\n\nPatients in Central and Southwest Florid,a most of the Panhandle and South Florida Counties are now in the managed care program, which is designed to better coordinate care and reduce costs. The remaining regions will roll into the program month by month until March 1.\n\nSummer said survey participants included program administrators, counselors who work with the elderly and disabled, program providers and academic professionals who study long-term care. These initial findings can serve as a lesson for the long-term care program moving forward and for the medical managed care implementation, she said.\n\n\"The program is pretty well designed. They put a lot of thought into the transition,\" she said. \"But that's the transition. I think it's going to be important to see what happens after the first year.\"", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Florida\u2019s unprecedented transition to managed care for its most fragile Medicaid patients is working, but questions remain about its benefit down the road,", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/long-term-care-transition-bumpy", "type": "article", "description": "Florida\u2019s unprecedented transition to managed care for its most fragile Medicaid patients is working, but questions remain about its benefit down the road,", "title": "Long-Term Care Transition Bumpy"}, "story_id": 250206736, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Mary Shedden", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Long-Term Care Transition Bumpy"}, "nid": 4879, "datePublished": "2013-12-11", "keywords": "long-term care, Medicaid managed care, Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA)", "wordCount": 723, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb651\"", "article_summary": "These initial findings can serve as a lesson for the long-term care program moving forward and for the medical managed care implementation, she said.\nEnrollment was cumbersome, with multiple calls needed to determine whether those who provide various services -- such as meals and personal care services -- were part of the new managed care plans.\nSo many people in long-term care are incapacitated, said Emma Hemness, a Brandon elder law attorney and member of the Foundation for LTC Solutions advocacy group.\nFour months ago, the state launched the first phase of its long-term care model, approved in 2011 by Florida\u2019s Legislature and authorized earlier this year by federal health administrators.\nSummer said survey participants included program administrators, counselors who work with the elderly and disabled, program providers and academic professionals who study long-term care."}
