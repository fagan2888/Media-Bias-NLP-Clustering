A 20-minute video including interviews with numerous LGBT Georgians is part of GLAAD’s recently launched Southern Stories project.

On June 23, GLAAD released its original mini-documentary, titled “State of Change: Georgia,” that features a who’s who of LGBT activists in Atlanta and throughout the state: Georgia Equality Executive Director Jeff Graham; Alejandro Lopez, Affordable Care Act navigator for the Health Initiative and Georgia Equality board member; the Health Initiative’s Executive Director Linda Ellis; and Lost-N-Found Executive Director Rick Westbrook.

Other interviewees include Dr. Beverly Guy-Sheftall, professor at Spelman College; Terry Guest, actor, who recently starred in “Marcus; of the Secret of Sweet” at Actor’s Express; Eris Lovell, a transgender teen elected homecoming queen at her East Cobb County high school; and Rev. Maressa Pendermon, founding minister of Unity Fellowship Church of Greater Atlanta;

The Georgia story is one of six Southern state stories being told by GLAAD. Other states are Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Florida and South Carolina.

“A cultural shift towards LGBT acceptance and understanding in the South must be our imperative. Americans’ attitudes and behavior on LGBT equality are not just influenced by what they see and hear, but who they know. GLAAD Southern Stories initiative tells the stories of LGBT people and their allies in the South to create that cultural shift,” according to a GLAAD statement on the project.
