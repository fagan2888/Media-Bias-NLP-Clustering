GRAND RAPIDS, MI – In response to the Affordable Care Act, West Michigan businesses have hired 1,000 fewer workers, according to a survey by Grand Valley State University researchers.

The report found many employers are reducing workers’ hours or limiting hiring and passing more health care costs to employees in reaction to the changes brought about by health care reform. Economics professors Leslie Muller and Paul Isely surveyed local businesses in Kent, Ottawa, Muskegon and Allegan counties.

“Conservatively, there would be 1,000 more workers today in Kent, Ottawa, Muskegon and Allegan counties if not for the ACA,” Muller said. “This is not even taking into effect the decrease in hours firms are making to keep employees at part-time.”

The report found 49 percent of firms already have increased employees’ share of health care costs. Of those shifting costs:

• 37 percent are using high-deductible plans

• 30 percent are changing prescription drug coverage

In changes to hiring, the report found employers made the following changes:

• 15 percent increased use of temporary workers

• 22 percent plan to reduce or limit hiring

• 29 percent have limited employee hours

The full report can be found on GVSU’s website.
