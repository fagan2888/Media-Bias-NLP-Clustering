Steve Beshear\u2019s Obamacare exchange and Medicaid expansion.\n\nWithout support from a divided Kentucky Legislature, Beshear created a state-run Obamacare exchange and opted in to Obamacare\u2019s expansion of Medicaid to working-age adults with no kids and no disabilities.\n\nPraising Beshear during his 2014 State of the Union speech, President Obama said the governor was \u201clike a man possessed\u201d when it came to implementing Obamacare \u2014 regardless of opposition from state legislators.\n\nUnfortunately for Obama and fans of his unpopular health insurance law, Beshear\u2019s unilateral actions leave the state\u2019s two biggest pro-Obamacare decisions open to reversal from Bevin.\n\nBevin won the Republican primary after promising to roll back Obamacare expansion. He aims to shut down Kynect \u2014 the state\u2019s Obamacare exchange \u2014 and direct Kentuckians to the federal exchange by the end of 2016.\n\nIf Bevin governs \u201clike a man possessed\u201d by opposition to Obamacare, Kentucky\u2019s Obamacare exchange and Medicaid expansion will both prove short-lived.\n\nCoverage in The Washington Post and elsewhere is indicative of the legacy-media beating Bevin would take if he doesn\u2019t back down, but Beshear\u2019s Obamacare expansion is already spiraling out of control.\n\n\u201cThe first enrollment period added more than 310,000 Kentuckians to the Medicaid program, nearly double the expected number,\u201d the Beshear administration said in a February report about the benefits of the deluge of new federal spending.\n\nKentucky\u2019s Obamacare expansion had enrolled 375,000 by the end of 2014; when implementing the expansion 1 1/2 years earlier, Beshear estimated 188,000 would enroll by 2021.\n\nNic Horton, a senior research fellow for the free-market Foundation for Government Accountability, told Watchdog Bevin\u2019s nine-point margin of victory reflects Kentuckians\u2019 support for his platform.\n\n\u201cI think Governor-elect Bevin is exactly right when he says Kentucky\u2019s Obamacare expansion needs to be repealed,\u201d Horton said. \u201cThe program has been a complete disaster.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact, the state has already signed up more than double the number of able-bodied adults they expected to ever enroll, at any point in the future,\u201d Horton said. \u201cIf the program were to continue, taxpayers would be forced to put up twice as much money as they were originally told.\u201d\n\nSince the Supreme Court gave states the ability to opt out of Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion, FGA has advised lawmakers to consider the long-term effects of expanding their welfare rolls for new federal money.\n\nBecause Obamacare promises 100 percent federal funding for Medicaid expansion benefits through 2016 and then tapers the federal funding to 90 percent, Beshear insists \u201cthe Bluegrass State couldn\u2019t afford not to expand Medicaid.\u201d\n\nBut if Kentucky\u2019s Obamacare expansion remains in place, the state share of the welfare program\u2019s benefit costs will soon threaten \u201cthings Kentuckians really care about, like roads, schools, law enforcement, or the truly needy,\u201d Horton explained.\n\nPrior to Obamacare, Medicaid was a program for pregnant women, children, the elderly, the disabled and impoverished families. Obamacare expansion comes with built-in incentives to cut benefits for traditional Medicaid recipients.\n\nThe feds pay for slightly more than 70 percent of Kentucky\u2019s traditional Medicaid benefits, which means it would be easier for the state to balance its budget with cuts to traditional Medicaid than with cuts to Obamacare expansion.\n\nHorton said Kentucky shouldn\u2019t follow the lead of Arkansas or Indiana by trying to request federal waivers to make Obamacare expansion more palatable to state taxpayers.\n\nThe Obama administration, he warned, \u201cis not interested in any reforms that help taxpayers, the truly needy, or the enrollees themselves. And ultimately, there\u2019s really no way to improve a welfare program for able-bodied adults.\u201d\n\nFGA recommends Kentucky wind down Obamacare expansion by refusing to take new applicants. Anyone already enrolled would remain covered until they gained enough income to move off of Medicaid.\n\n\u201cArizona took this approach in 2011 and nearly half of the enrollees left the program within a year,\u201d Horton told Watchdog. In Tennessee, he said, more people found employment and gained private insurance when working-age adults were removed from Medicaid in 2005.\n\n\u201cThese folks need jobs, not welfare, and any welfare program is going to penalize them for trying to climb the economic ladder. Window dressing can\u2019t change the fundamentals of how welfare punishes work,\u201d Horton concluded.\n\nBevin\u2019s campaign did not respond to questions about how he will tackle Kentucky\u2019s Obamacare exchange and Medicaid expansion upon taking office in December.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What Kentucky's Democratic governor has done to implement Obamacare may soon be undone by the Republican governor-elect.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "What Kentucky's Democratic governor has done to implement Obamacare may soon be undone by the Republican governor-elect.", "title": "Governor-elect Bevin set to roll back Obamacare in Kentucky - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/11/matt-bevin-facebook-2015-02-21.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-10T15:08:42+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/246281/bevin-roll-back-obamacare-kentucky/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "What Kentucky's Democratic governor has done to implement Obamacare may soon be undone by the Republican governor-elect.", "title": "Governor-elect Bevin set to roll back Obamacare in Kentucky - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/11/matt-bevin-facebook-2015-02-21.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Health Care", "published_time": "2015-11-11T04:00:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-10T15:08:42+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "obamacare kentucky, kentucky obamacare, obamacare expansion, medicaid expansion, kentucky medicaid expansion, kentucky obamacare expansion, matt bevin, foundation for government accountability, nic horton"}, "article_summary": "If Bevin governs \u201clike a man possessed\u201d by opposition to Obamacare, Kentucky\u2019s Obamacare exchange and Medicaid expansion will both prove short-lived.\n\u201cI think Governor-elect Bevin is exactly right when he says Kentucky\u2019s Obamacare expansion needs to be repealed,\u201d Horton said.\nBevin won the Republican primary after promising to roll back Obamacare expansion.\nHe aims to shut down Kynect \u2014 the state\u2019s Obamacare exchange \u2014 and direct Kentuckians to the federal exchange by the end of 2016.\nBevin\u2019s campaign did not respond to questions about how he will tackle Kentucky\u2019s Obamacare exchange and Medicaid expansion upon taking office in December."}
