That risk is always built into any calculations you make.\u201d\n\nIf, or when, FDA approval comes, backers believe Star Scientific could be an acquisition target for one of the world\u2019s pharmaceutical giants: for instance, Pfizer, Eli Lilly & Co. or GlaxoSmithKline.\n\n\u201cMoving to Sarasota is one of the best things that could have ever happened to this company,\u201d said Robert W. Scannell, whose San Francisco-based Tradewinds Investment Management LP owns just under 10 percent of Star Scientific\u2019s 181 million shares.\n\n\u201cDr. Mullan and his staff are truly world-class researchers,\u201d Scannell said.\n\n\u201cIt would cost us tens of millions of dollars to build what Roskamp already has in place, so to be able to sublease some of that expertise is a great business trade-off.\u201d\n\nRoskamp\u2019s involvement comes on the heels of a turbulent 2013 for Star Scientific.\n\nIt ran afoul of the FDA for making health claims the agency thought were inappropriate, and its CEO at that time, Jonnie Williams, was forced to step down because of an alleged corruption scandal.\n\nMullan said Star Scientific will no longer make the health claims for its over-the-counter drug that spurred FDA questions.\n\nBut the company could face further turbulence in July, when former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, go to trial on 14 counts that they accepted $165,000 from Williams in exchange for helping promote Star Scientific products.\n\nTo counter that unfavorable publicity, Roskamp is changing the company\u2019s name to Rock Creek Pharmaceuticals Inc., after a key subsidiary.\n\nThe name change fits in with ambitious plans for the company to develop a prescription-only version of Star\u2019s key drug, derived from anatabine, an alkaloid present in tobacco, tomatoes and eggplants.\n\nStar has a portfolio of patents and patents pending based on variations of the compound it created, anatabine citrate.\n\nBut even Roskamp officials acknowledge that winning FDA approval for prescription status could cost millions and take three to five years to complete \u2014 if it can be completed at all.\n\nStill, the payoff could be huge: Prescription arthritis drugs alone represent a $15 billion annual market.\n\nStar Scientific\u2019s over-the-counter product, Anatabloc, is, for now, sold at GNC outlets and online. It has been sold for more than three years and has attracted a following for its ability to reduce swelling in joints.\n\n\u201cThe key developmental question is, can it be developed for a number of inflammatory disorders?\u201d Mullan said. \u201cThat is the strategy of the company, to see if we can develop them for a number of inflammatory disorders \u2014 arthritis, ulcerative colitis, maybe some immune disorders.\u201d\n\nRoskamp was drawn to Star Scientific primarily because of evidence that Alzheimer\u2019s disease has a strong inflammatory component to it.\n\nOne Roskamp peer-reviewed study showed that anatabine can suppress brain inflammation, which affects Alzheimer\u2019s disease sufferers.\n\n\u201cIt does have this anti-inflammatory effect,\u201d Mullan said. \u201cIt seems to signal to inflammatory cells to calm down.\u201d\n\nBoth Mullan and Roskamp officials have a personal stake in seeing Star Scientific succeed.\n\nSenior housing developer Bob Roskamp, the institute\u2019s founder, bought 1.5 million of Star Scientific\u2019s shares beginning in 2010, said Ted Jenkins, the company\u2019s head of corporate strategy and development.\n\nMullan owns warrants or stock options on some 6 million shares, Scannell said.\n\nIn all, Star Scientific has 181 million shares outstanding, equating to market capitalization of $143 million based on its recent price of 79 cents per share.\n\nThe stock, traded via over-the-counter exchange, has been extremely volatile during the past five years. At one point in July 2012, the shares rose to roughly $5 before sinking.\n\nThe price could rise dramatically if FDA approvals are obtained.\n\nMullan hopes to file an application with the agency by the end of June, though the institute has yet to state which medical condition it intends to target.\n\nThe first two of three phases in the agency\u2019s \u201cinvestigational new drug process\u201d could take two years. But Star Scientific has a headstart, in that its anatabine compound has been in use for years.\n\nMullan said the company has kept extensive data on consumers\u2019 experiences \u2014 including misuse by patients who have increased dosages beyond the recommended amount \u2014 that could expedite the FDA research.\n\n\u201cThey may say: \u2018Look, it is in the food chain, it has been in an awful lot of people. We haven\u2019t had any serious adverse effects directly attributable to it,\u2019 \u201d Mullan said.\n\nIrv DeGraw, a professor of finance at St. Petersburg College, said that Roskamp\u2019s involvement is encouraging.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably their biggest endorsement,\u201d DeGraw said.\n\nThe drug \u2014 with FDA approval \u2014 could become very attractive to a big pharmaceutical company, DeGraw said.\n\n\u201cI am sure they are looking to get somebody else to get involved, one of the big players,\u201d he said. \u201cThink about it. I am making progress with the FDA. Now I go to some of the big guys. If they like the idea, they will take it over. That happens a lot.\u201d\n\nThat prospect has also occurred to Scannell, the investor.\n\n\u201cMy guess,\u201d Scannell said, \u201cis that there will be conversations with a major pharmaceutical partner going on over the next two years, and that a deal of some sort will be struck.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde1ee\"", "article_summary": "But Star Scientific has a headstart, in that its anatabine compound has been in use for years.\nRoskamp managers plan to move Star Scientific to Southwest Florida.\n\u201cIt seems to signal to inflammatory cells to calm down.\u201dBoth Mullan and Roskamp officials have a personal stake in seeing Star Scientific succeed.\nBob McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, go to trial on 14 counts that they accepted $165,000 from Williams in exchange for helping promote Star Scientific products.\nMullan said Star Scientific will no longer make the health claims for its over-the-counter drug that spurred FDA questions."}
