Millenson dissected the matter in a recent column, concluding that, to a certain extent, AHRQ has been its own worst enemy.\n\nMillenson suggests that the agency take three immediate actions to avoid extinction:\n\nRecruit a new leader who can communicate more openly with the public and the media and who will work effectively with those who control the agency's budget \u2013 in this case, the Republican majority: for example, Brent James, MD, MStat, a surgeon and statistician who founded Intermountain Healthcare's Institute for Healthcare Leadership, or Peter Pronovost, MD, PhD, of Johns Hopkins' Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality.\n\nChange the agency's name and affiliation to explain what is meant by health services research and why it benefits consumers. \"Names and labels define us.\" Millenson recommends a title that retains the theme of science and/or medicine; e.g., Agency for Translational Medicine or the National Institute for Translational Medicine.\n\nPersonalize the real benefits of what AHRQ and health services research accomplish. In addition to helping to keep sick and vulnerable people out of hospitals and affording extra protection from medical errors, the AHRQ has been instrumental in assuring that discoveries made at NIH and CDC are applied in real-world settings whether they focus on improving health or preventing unnecessary procedures.\n\nRob Lieberthal, PhD, a health sciences researcher and assistant professor on our faculty, observed that the plight of AHRQ makes a great case study for demonstrating why health services researchers must do a better job of explaining the importance of our work to policymakers and the general public.\n\nI couldn't agree more, and I hope that the powers that be act swiftly \u2013 before the ax falls.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "David   Nash, MD, MBA, FACP", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/Columns/FocusonPolicy/52682", "image": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/assets/images/defaultLede.png", "description": "A House proposal to cut all funding to AHRQ is a bad idea, says David Nash, MD, MBA.", "card": "Summary", "title": "Defunding AHRQ: A Shot to the Foot"}, "dc.date.issued": "2015-07-23 09:00:00", "sailthru.is_cme": 0, "sailthru.tags": "primarycare,publichealthpolicy,healthpolicy,generalprimarycare,columns,focusonpolicy,nursing,nursing", "sailthru.date": "2015-07-23 09:00:00", "sailthru.title": "Defunding AHRQ: A Shot to the Foot", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "verify-v1": "Vy2WQqSVx1yA90Uu2Rw12f2R8yqP7X0cxBFbafIuqao=", "sailthru.exclude": 1, "description": "A House proposal to cut all funding to AHRQ is a bad idea, says David Nash, MD, MBA.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-07-24 09:07:00", "date": "2015-07-23 09:00:00", "sailthru.description": "A House proposal to cut all funding to AHRQ is a bad idea, says David Nash, MD, MBA.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/Columns/FocusonPolicy/52682", "image": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/assets/images/defaultLede.png", "type": "article", "description": "A House proposal to cut all funding to AHRQ is a bad idea, says David Nash, MD, MBA.", "title": "Defunding AHRQ: A Shot to the Foot"}, "sailthru.featured": 0, "dc.date": "2015-07-23 09:00:00", "sailthru.is_video": 0, "google-site-verification": "0uwxbLV_H5lccP3wm0UgRXFQ9w6ZQXh9ZLn-G0av8i0", "sailthru.speciality": "Other,primarycare", "sailthru.image.full": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/assets/images/defaultLede.png"}, "article_summary": "Change the agency's name and affiliation to explain what is meant by health services research and why it benefits consumers.\nPersonalize the real benefits of what AHRQ and health services research accomplish.\nMillenson recommends a title that retains the theme of science and/or medicine; e.g., Agency for Translational Medicine or the National Institute for Translational Medicine.\nSo it was with tremendous disappointment that I received news of a House subcommittee's decision to de-fund the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) as of October 1, 2015 -- disappointed, but not surprised.\nThat being the case, there has never been a time when health sciences research has been more important."}
