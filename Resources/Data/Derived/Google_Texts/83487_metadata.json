This requires us to accelerate a variety of recovery efforts across the health care system in order to meet our fiscal year 2014 financial plan.\"\n\nUMass Memorial had a $55 million dollar operating loss in the last fiscal year. In his blog, Dickson wrote that although progress is being made to reduce that loss, it is not happening fast enough. For this reason the company's bond rating was downgraded from a Baa3 to a Baa1, a rating that is considered to be risky for investment.\n\nAccording to the Moody's release, \"Although the new senior management team is implementing strategies to improve performance, rapid progress will be challenging and the new team faces headwinds.\"\n\nThose challenges, according to the rating agency, include reduced cash flow, a large unionized employee base and declining in patient admissions, in addition to a complex debt structure and 19.4 percent of the Worcester-based medical center's income tied to Medicaid reimbursement.\n\nOver the past few months, UMass Memorial Health Care has held sporadic employee layoffs and announced the transfer of ownership of its Palmer-based Wing Memorial Hospital campus to Baystate Health.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Megan Bard | mmorse@masslive.com", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "bond-rating, moodys, umass-memorial, university-of-massachusetts-memorial-medical-center, worcester, news", "title": "Moody's downgrades UMass Memorial Health Care's bond rating, considered risky investment", "og": {"site_name": "masslive.com", "description": "A national bond rating agency has predicted a negative outlook for the region's largest medical organization and downgraded its bond rating.", "title": "Moody's downgrades UMass Memorial Health Care's bond rating, considered risky investment", "url": "http://www.masslive.com/news/worcester/index.ssf/2014/03/moodys_downgrades_umass_memori.html", "image": "http://image.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/republican/photo/2013/12/13928943-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A national bond rating agency has predicted a negative outlook for the region's largest medical organization and downgraded its bond rating.", "title": "Moody's downgrades UMass Memorial Health Care's bond rating, considered risky investment", "image": "http://image.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/republican/photo/2013/12/13928943-standard.jpg", "creator": "@mbardmorse", "site": "@masslivenews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, March 11, 2014,  4:30 PM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "masslive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, March 11, 2014,  3:30 PM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "A national bond rating agency has predicted a negative outlook for the region's largest medical organization and downgraded its bond rating."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde9f5\"", "article_summary": "WORCESTER \u2014 A national bond rating agency has predicted a negative outlook for the region's largest medical organization and downgraded its bond rating.\nOver the past few months, UMass Memorial Health Care has held sporadic employee layoffs and announced the transfer of ownership of its Palmer-based Wing Memorial Hospital campus to Baystate Health.\nFor this reason the company's bond rating was downgraded from a Baa3 to a Baa1, a rating that is considered to be risky for investment.\nMoody's Investment Services announced UMass Memorial Health Care's change in bond status earlier this month and Dr. Eric Dickson, president and CEO of medical system, shared the information on his blog, on Monday.\nDespite the change in rating status, UMass health care officials said that the system remains committed to quality, affordable health care and that any operational challenges that exist are short-term."}
