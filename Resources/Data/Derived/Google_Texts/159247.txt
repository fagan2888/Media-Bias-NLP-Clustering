Franklin County's Alcohol, Drug and Mental Health Board will seek a five-year, 2.2-mill renewal levy on the November general election ballot.

It cuts ADAMH's levy-request interval from 10 to five years, allowing the agency to provide system stability by providing existing services while also meeting the emerging needs in behavioral healthcare, said David Royer, ADAMH CEO.

"This allows some flexibility for innovation," he said.

Royer said the renewal levy will not cost homeowners additional money. The Franklin County Board of Commissioners must vote to place the levy on the ballot. That move is expected to happen July 21.

The levy, if passed in November, will not be collected until 2017. The rate would remain the same, costing a little more than $67 per $100,000 of home valuation and raising roughly $78 million a year, ADAMH officials said.

Royer said the tighter levy timeline will allow the agency to prepare for policy changes in Medicare expansion and the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare.

For example, the agency reduced spending for treatment services by $6.1 million from 2013 to 2014, a reduction primarily attributed to Medicaid expansion, said Aimee Shadwick, spokeswoman for the agency.

Still, ADAMH has started or expanded services in other areas.

One of the biggest areas was intervention services in 14 suburban school districts, which will cost $2.6 million in 2015, Shadwick said.

Youth crisis expansion totaled nearly $1.9 million and homeless outreach another $380,000 this year, she said.

ADAMH does not provide direct treatment for patients, Royer said. It contracts with more than 35 nonprofit organizations that provide care, he said.
