Ted Cruz stood on a stage straddling the lanes of a dragway at the Charlotte Motor Speedway on Sunday, speaking directly to blue-collar workers with \u201ccalluses on your hands\u201d and railing against the political establishment \u2014 prompting cheers and stomps on the metal bleachers.\n\nMeanwhile in Florida, a group of volunteers, including wealthy donors who supported Jeb Bush\u2019s candidacy, was knocking on doors this weekend in Jacksonville, asking voters to cast ballots for Cruz (Tex.) in Tuesday\u2019s Republican primary.\n\nAs Cruz hopes to land a knockout blow against Sen. Marco Rubio in Florida and narrow the primary contest to a two-man race between himself and Donald Trump, he is increasingly trying to appeal to two very different groups: working-class voters who may find themselves drawn to Trump, and voters from the traditional political establishment who want to stop him.\n\n[Cruz looks to take on Rubio on the fellow senator\u2019s home turf]\n\n\u201cFor a lot of supporters I think it comes down to this sudden reality of a Donald Trump nomination,\u201d said one of the Jacksonville door-knockers, Paul Dickerson, a Houston lawyer who supported Bush but is now backing Cruz, whom he considers a friend. Trump, he said, \u201cwould be a disaster for the country and embarrassment for the nation, and Ted is the best chance to defeat Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Ted Cruz received his first endorsement from a Senate colleague when Sen. Mike Lee of Utah backed him for the party's nomination. (Reuters)\n\nThe fit is not a natural one for Cruz, who pillories the political establishment on the campaign trail and wants to blow up what he calls the \u201cWashington cartel\u201d of lobbyists and special interests. He is detested in the Senate \u2014 Cruz jokes that he needs a \u201cfood taster\u201d in the dining room there \u2014 and only one colleague has endorsed him.\n\nBut with Rubio\u2019s candidacy sputtering and with Ohio Gov. John Kasich far behind, the establishment is warming to a man who called Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) a \u201cliar\u201d on the Senate floor. Even Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a longtime Cruz nemesis, now says the party may need to unite behind him. And Neil Bush, Jeb Bush\u2019s brother, is supporting Cruz.\n\nMany point to Cruz\u2019s second-place standing in the delegate race and his organized and well-funded campaign as reasons to support him.\n\n[A lot of people just don\u2019t like Ted Cruz. How come that\u2019s okay with him?]\n\n\u201cMost of the people that I know would not have been naturally with Ted,\u201d said Charles Foster, a Houston lawyer who backed Bush in the presidential race and Cruz\u2019s opponent in the Republican primary for his Senate seat in 2012. \u201c. . . Some are reluctant because that\u2019s not where they were to begin with, and some are still sitting on their hands.\u201d\n\nThe establishment world is hardly foreign to the Texas Republican. Cruz; his wife, Heidi; and his campaign chairman, Chad Sweet, all worked for George W. Bush and are making overtures to people who supported Jeb Bush, Cruz backers said. Foster said Cruz called him, while Dickerson said the campaign has been quick to extend a \u201cwelcoming hand\u201d with no hard feelings. (Cruz\u2019s campaign said there is no concerted effort to woo Bush supporters.)\n\nCruz is making the same type of overture to voters on the campaign trail, asserting that he is the only candidate who can beat Trump and directly appealing to those who support other candidates. But he is also infusing more populism into his stump speeches \u2014 a direct appeal to would-be Trump backers.\n\nThe Ohio GOP primary could be the Republican establishment's last chance to stop Donald Trump. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cLet me talk for a minute to all the single moms who are here, who are working two or three part-time jobs,\u201d Cruz, clad in a navy jacket with brass buttons, said at the speedway. \u201cLet me talk to all the truck drivers, the mechanics and plumbers and electricians, the union members.\u201d\n\nThe candidate\u2019s economic message is largely conservative boilerplate, arguing that the \u201cjackboot of government\u201d hurts growth and jobs. But Cruz has taken to tying this message specifically to individual workers, arguing that they would fare better with fewer regulations and with a repeal of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s in stark contrast to Donald Trump\u2019s economic plan, which seems to be: \u2018Hey, everybody, look. I\u2019m rich. Maybe you can be rich too,\u2019 \u201d said Cruz spokesman Jason Miller. \u201cWhen you\u2019re out in real America, people are hurting, and what they care about is putting food on the table and helping their families.\u201d\n\n[A guide to everything Ted Cruz wants to abolish, bar or change]\n\nThe campaign is also painting illegal immigration as an economic issue, arguing that blue-collar and low-income Americans are most hurt by an influx of undocumented immigrants.\n\nVincent Fernandez, 71, a retired tool-and-die maker from Scott City, Mo., attended a Cruz rally in nearby Cape Girardeau. Fernandez said he doesn\u2019t like Trump\u2019s \u201cbig mouth\u201d and believes that Cruz will help the economy.\n\n\u201cI think Ted Cruz will look out and support the working men and the working women across the country,\u201d he said. Fernandez gets coffee each morning with a group of men who are working or are retired from blue-collar jobs, and he said their allegiances are evenly split between Cruz and Trump.\n\nHere at the Charlotte speedway, the attendees of the event sponsored by a pro-Cruz super PAC included country singer Aaron Watson, who performed, and C. Boyden Gray, a lawyer and longtime fixture in GOP politics.\n\nIn the stands, Missy Groce, 29, a director of marketing from Jacksonville, said she doesn\u2019t like Trump but likes that Cruz wants to stop illegal immigration and that he looks at the issue through the lens of people\u2019s paychecks.\n\n\u201cAll the money is going to illegal immigrants,\u201d Groce said, \u201cdespite the fact that you work hard every day.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "He is trying to appeal to two very different groups: the working class and elites.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/zezimak", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "He is trying to appeal to two very different groups: the working class and elites.", "title": "Ted Cruz finds new allies in GOP establishment he rails against", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ted-cruz-finds-new-allies-in-gop-establishment-he-rails-against/2016/03/14/a73d3486-e8a9-11e5-b0fd-073d5930a7b7_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/03/14/National-Politics/Images/GOP_2016_Cruz-193e3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@katiezez"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ted-cruz-finds-new-allies-in-gop-establishment-he-rails-against/2016/03/14/a73d3486-e8a9-11e5-b0fd-073d5930a7b7_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/zezimak"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "a73d3486-e8a9-11e5-b0fd-073d5930a7b7"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI think Ted Cruz will look out and support the working men and the working women across the country,\u201d he said.\n[A lot of people just don\u2019t like Ted Cruz.\nThe Ohio GOP primary could be the Republican establishment's last chance to stop Donald Trump.\nHe is detested in the Senate \u2014 Cruz jokes that he needs a \u201cfood taster\u201d in the dining room there \u2014 and only one colleague has endorsed him.\nCruz; his wife, Heidi; and his campaign chairman, Chad Sweet, all worked for George W.
