Dennis Wong / CC BY 2.0\n\nHumans certainly aren\u2019t as discerning as dogs when it comes to identifying smells and following them \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean that our noses aren\u2019t capable of smelling a wide variety of different scents.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s likely that our noses can smell billions and even trillions of different smells. This is an overwhelming number, but it all comes down to scent, or olfactory, receptors in our nose \u2014 as the video below explains. Whenever we take a breath, air molecules enter our noses and land on the olfactory epithelium, a mucus-covered tissue lining the nasal cavity. This area is filled with millions of olfactory receptor neurons, which are smell-detecting nerves that are able to connect to and identify odor molecules.\n\nWhen the odor molecules of coffee or cinnamon enter the nose, for example, they bind to specific olfactory receptors that are designed to identify that specific molecule. It\u2019s similar to a lock and key situation; but because odor molecules have lots of different shapes that can fit in receptors, they\u2019re capable of smelling a greater number of smells than the number of receptors that exist.\n\nThough the exact number of our possible smells isn\u2019t certain, scientists have recently decided that it could be as high as 1 trillion \u2014 which is enough \u201cscratch and sniff stickers to reach from here and back to the moon, 32 times,\u201d the speaker in the video notes. Previously, scientists had assumed our smelling range was only to 10,000, but recent research overturned that.\n\nSo while we rely primarily on our eyes and ears to get through our daily routines, don\u2019t brush aside the importance of the human nose: On top of being a powerful trigger for memories, it can provide us with a wide palette of different smells. \u201cCompared to our eyes and ears, our sense of smell may be the most boundless,\u201d the speaker says.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "number of smells, smell, nose, olfactory system", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Scent receptors in our nose are possibly numbered in the trillions, giving humans the ability to detect a wide variety of different smells.", "title": "How Many Different Smells Can You Smell?
