(Republican Eagle photo by Kyle Stevens)\n\nROCHESTER - Joey Majerus had to go the distance twice, and the last time was worth every minute as the Zumbrota-Mazeppa 120-pounder beat top-seeded Jared Goldsmith of Chatfield, 6-4, to win a Section 1A championship Saturday at the Mayo Civic Center in Rochester, and earn a spot in the Class 1A state tournament next weekend.\n\nHayden Stensland (113) will also head to St. Paul as individual after taking second place. Stensland lost 9-0 to Pine Island\u2019s Noah Bauer in the title match after upsetting top-seeded Kaleb Olson of Wabasha-Kellogg in the semifinals.\n\nMaverick Jackson (132) did everything the hard way on Saturday, winning his first match before falling 12-5 to Corbin Powrie of Dover-Eyota in the quarterfinals. Jackson then pinned Hunter Jennings, and Jacy Ball before getting his revenge on Powrie in the third-place match to set up a true second place match with Isaac Haman of Pine Island. Jackson wouldn\u2019t let the opportunity slip by, beating Haman 9-4 to clinch a spot at state.\n\nZ-M continued its march to state with Freedom Hunt\u2019s true-second-place victory over Goodhue\u2019s Kaleb O\u2019Reilly. Hunt earned his state berth with a 5-0 win over O\u2019Reilly, which followed an easy quarterfinal victory, an overtime pin in the semifinals, and a loss by fall in the finals to Chatfield\u2019s Hank Friederichs.\n\nDevin Manzy cruised into the 160-pound finals, but fell 14-3 to Kenyon-Wanamingo\u2019s Ted Androli. Manzy beat third-place winner Keaton Schaefer of Dover-Eyota, 9-4 in the semifinals, and did not need a true second-place match to head to state.\n\nDillon Downes handled Dover-Eyota\u2019s Michael Otomo, 10-5, in the 170-pound semifinals, so Otomo\u2019s third-place victory, and Downes\u2019 3-2 loss to Kenyon-Wanamingo\u2019s Drew Sathrum in the finals was enough for a trip to the Class 1A state tournament.\n\nCaden Steffen (152) lost a true second-place match to Goodhue\u2019s Bailee O\u2019Reilly, 3-2.\n\nIn addition to sending six wrestlers to the individual tournament, as well as the whole team after winning the Section 1A team title last weekend, the Cougars also left Rochester with some hardware for a couple of instructors as Link Steffen was named Section 1A Head Coach of the Year, and Mark Krier was named the Section 1A Assistant Coach of the Year.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "sports,high school,Wrestling,Zumbrota-Mazeppa Cougars", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Kyle Stevens", "og": {"site_name": "Republican Eagle", "description": "ROCHESTER - Joey Majerus had to go the distance twice, and the last time was worth every minute as the Zumbrota-Mazeppa 120-pounder beat top-seeded Jared Goldsmith of Chatfield, 6-4, to win a Section 1A championship Saturday at the Mayo Civic Center in Rochester, and earn a spot in the Class 1A stat...", "title": "Wrestling: Z-M punches six tickets to state", "url": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/sports/high-school/3684719-wrestling-z-m-punches-six-tickets-state", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/sites/default/files/styles/square_300/public/field/image/joey%20majerus%20sec%20final.jpg?itok=TIODLlbT", "height": 300}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "ROCHESTER - Joey Majerus had to go the distance twice, and the last time was worth every minute as the Zumbrota-Mazeppa 120-pounder beat top-seeded Jared Goldsmith of Chatfield, 6-4, to win a Section 1A championship Saturday at the Mayo Civic Center in Rochester, and earn a spot in the Class 1A stat...", "title": "Wrestling: Z-M punches six tickets to state", "url": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/sports/high-school/3684719-wrestling-z-m-punches-six-tickets-state", "image": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_430/public/field/image/joey%20majerus%20sec%20final.jpg?itok=eaDGtbni", "site": "republicaneagle", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 243322109167890}, "keywords": "sports,high school,Wrestling,Zumbrota-Mazeppa Cougars", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/redwingrepublicaneagle", "tag": "sports,high school,Wrestling,Zumbrota-Mazeppa Cougars", "modified_time": "2015-02-21T22:49:48-06:00"}, "image": {"alt": "Zumbrota-Mazeppa's Joey Majerus searches for a hold against Jared Goldsmith of Chatfield during the 120-pound, Section 1A finals Saturday at Mayo Civic Center in Rochster.
