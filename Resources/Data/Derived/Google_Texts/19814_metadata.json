As recently as this summer, Elmendorf reiterated during testimony that CBO believes the law will actually reduce the deficit\u2014a judgment Republicans continue to insist is wrong. But, overall, Republicans say they hold Elmendorf in high esteem, and in 2011 they signed off on his reappointment without much fuss, allowing him to serve the full four-year term that ends in January.\n\nRepublican leaders should keep that in mind as they think about who should run CBO next. A number of names are in circulation right now. They include Donald Marron, who was a temporary director of the CBO in 2006 and is now director of economic studies at the Urban Institute, and James Capretta, who served in the Bush Administration and is now at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. You can read about these and other candidates in the Wall Street Journal and Roll Call. I haven't performed due diligence on any of these candidates and cannot even confirm that any are actually on the short list\u2014although some of the names, like Capretta, lack the formal economic credentials that CBO directors typically have.\n\nBut there\u2019s another candidate Republicans might be considering\u2014and, if they aren\u2019t, whom they should be considering. That would be Elmendorf, who's earned his reputation for both impartiality and transparency. (He's continued the tradition started by Orszag of writing a \"director's blog,\" which has been invalauble for explaining to the rest of the world how CBO operates and makes its judgments.) It\u2019s not clear whether Elmendorf wants to stay on for another term, but over the weekend he got endorsements from two high-profile conservative economists.\n\nOne is Greg Mankiw, whose name has also been mentioned as a candidate. Mankiw, a well-known economist at Harvard and writer who worked in the Bush Administration, had this to say about Elmendorf:\n\nSomeone recently said to me that the CBO director is not really a player in the political game. He is more like the referee. That analogy sheds light on why Doug is the right person for the job. What do you want in a good referee? Competence and impartiality. Doug has demonstrated both. He is a superb economist and, over the past six years as CBO director, has shown himself to be scrupulously non-partisan. I understand that GOP leaders may be tempted to put their own stamp on the Congressional Budget Office. But sometimes the benefits of continuity transcend ideology and political affiliation. Ronald Reagan reappointed Paul Volcker, and Barack Obama reappointed Ben Bernanke, despite the fact that both Fed chairs were initially appointed by a president of the other party. In the same spirit, I would encourage the GOP congressional leaders to reappoint Doug Elmendorf as CBO director.\n\nMichael Strain, who is deputy director of economic studies at the AEI and among the most influential economists in conservative circles these days, offered a similarly unambiguous endorsement:\n\nDoug Elmendorf has been an outstanding CBO director. The United States should be grateful for his impartiality, skill, and service. @USCBO \u2014 Michael R. Strain (@MichaelRStrain) November 15, 2014\n\nAs Mankiw notes, Republicans might be tempted to \u201cput their own stamp\u201d on the office\u2014which could mean not just installing somebody who has worked for Republicans in the past, but also somebody who believes in ideas like \u201cdynamic scoring\u201d that would make Republican-supported tax cuts seem a lot less costly. But doing so would be seen, rightly, as an attempt to rig the budget game by changing the rules.\n\nIn this highly politicized era, impartial sources of relaible policy information are hard to find. CBO is one of the last. Republians would do us all a favor by appointing somebody like Elmendorf\u2014or, better still, reappointing Elmendorf himself.\n\nUpdate: I originally misidentified Strain as director of economic studies at AEI and called Donald Morran \"Douglas.\" Next time I'll have my second cup of coffee before posting.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Republicans have a well-deserved reputation for&nbsp;manipulating the budget process.
