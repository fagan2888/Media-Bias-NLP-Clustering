“I know this is not going to come as any surprise to all you heroes out there,” Colbert began. “But I have had it up to here with Russia!” And why? Well, it’s not just because Putin has been “out-masculating” President Obama — playing games of hockey and scoring six goals.

Colbert is also referring to Russia’s recent decision to block the U.S. from the International Space Station after the year 2020, due to sanctions the U.S. has leveled against them. On Tuesday, Russia’s deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin — “slavic Chris Christie” — announced that Russia had rejected a request by the U.S. to keep operating the space station until 2024. Russia’s section of the space station can operate independently, but the U.S. section is not self-sufficient.
