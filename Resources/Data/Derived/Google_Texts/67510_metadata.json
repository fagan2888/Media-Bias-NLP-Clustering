Screen shot from NBC News The top-ranking leader of the Taliban faction that claimed responsibility for last month\u2019s mass slaughter of 153 people, many of them children, at the Army Public School in Peshawar, Pakistan, has taken to the Internet to warn that his group is prepared to strike again. On Tuesday, word emerged that Taliban-Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTTP) chief Maulana Fazlullah had issued a 12-minute video in which he threatened the lives of more children of military officers in retaliation for attacks on his group, as NBC News reported that day: \u201cEvery action has a reaction.
