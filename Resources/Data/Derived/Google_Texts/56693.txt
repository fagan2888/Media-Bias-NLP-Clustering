What it asks: "Shall Section 7 of the Charter be amended pursuant to Ordinance No. 8052 to add an annual salary for council members in the amount of $10,000, with an annual increase equal to the percentage increase in the consumer price index and to add health benefits equivalent to those received by city employees?"

What it means: Should City Council members get a $10,000 annual salary, which will increase with inflation, in addition to the per-meeting pay they get now, and health benefits equivalent to those received by city employees? Council members currently earn $206.97 per meeting for up to 52 meetings per year, with the maximum pay being $10,762.44. Adding the base salary would put City Council members above $20,000 a year.

What supporters say: Offering a higher salary and health insurance will make it possible for people from more diverse economic backgrounds to serve on City Council. Adding a base salary also reflects the large amount of work council members do outside of meetings.

What opponents say: Serving on council should be essentially a volunteer position, and raising the pay moves it closer to being a job. Others believe the pay increase isn't large enough to make a difference in the types of candidates who can afford to serve.
