Doctors discovered that a treatment for low testosterone was causing heart problems because they were able to compare the health records of thousands of veterans before and after they started testosterone therapy.\n\nSix states held primary elections Tuesday, and the obvious story line about the outcome was that the Tea Party lost. But it\u2019s more complicated than that, David Weigel writes\u2014even in defeat, the Tea Party has changed what the GOP stands for.\n\nWeigel also says the media is too loose with the term \u201cTea Party.\u201d\n\nAn increasing number of Hispanics have changed their census identification to \u201cwhite,\u201d Nate Cohn writes in the New York Times. Also in the Times, Thomas Edsall argues that the Republican Party will be able to win by appealing only to white voters for a while to come.\n\nFormer Executive Editor Jill Abramson was fired from the New York Times last Wednesday.\n\nAmerica should consider the possibility of paying reparations to black Americans, Ta-Nehisi Coates writes in the Atlantic.\n\nFor the past 25 years, Rep. John Conyers has introduced a bill in each session of Congress calling for a study of slavery and its lingering effects.\n\nIn 2011, Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter told young black men to \u201cPull your pants up and buy a belt, \u2019cause no one wants to see your underwear or the crack of your butt.\u201d\n\nJamelle Bouie describes what reparations might look like.\n\nJohn chatters about the Week\u2019s Bad Opinion Generator.\n\nEmily chatters about a pair of readings on school reform: a recent New Yorker article by Dale Russakoff and The Teacher Wars by Dana Goldstein.\n\nDavid chatters about the CIA\u2019s announcement that it will no longer use immunization campaigns as part of its spy operations.\n\nTopic ideas for next week?
