Until now.\n\nAn analysis by HIS Jane\u2019s Conflict Monitor team estimates that ISIS lost nearly 800 square miles, or 14 percent, of its territory in 2015. The terror group, while still in control of large chunks of land and cities inside Iraq and Syria, was routed along Syria\u2019s northern border with Turkey, which has long been a concern of the U.S. and its allies as a major causeway for jihadists.\n\nThe rollback can largely be credited to Kurdish forces, known as the Peshmerga, who have become the critical ally on the ground in the anti-ISIS fight. Jane\u2019s estimates that the Kurds expanded the territory under their control by 9,800 square miles, or 186 percent, in the last calendar year.\n\nRelated: America\u2019s Top General Says We\u2019re Not Ready to Defeat ISIS\n\nBut for every action, there is an opposite reaction: ISIS drove deeper into western Syria and captured the Iraqi city of Ramadi, which was a major blow to the government in Baghdad.\n\nThe estimates come at a critical time for the U.S.-led effort against ISIS. Iraqi forces are now engaged in a bitter fight to retake Ramadi from the extremist group. Earlier this month Defense Secretary Ash Carter said Iraqi progress in retaking the city had been \"disappointingly slow\u201d but the picture seems to be improving.\n\n\u201cI think the fall of Ramadi is inevitable,\u201d Col. Steve Warren, a spokesman for the U.S. military campaign in Iraq, told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough fight.\u201d\n\nRelated: Running Out of Patience, Obama Rebuffs Attacks on His ISIS Strategy\n\nThe independent analysis offer a concrete example of the progress Obama\u2019s strategy for eliminating ISIS and could be used to as a tool by the administration to fend off critics who believe the White House should ramp up the battle against the terror group.\n\nIn an interview with NPR released earlier this week, the president admitted he hadn\u2019t done a good job explaining the inroads that had been made.\n\n\u201cIf people haven't seen the fact that in fact 9,000 strikes have been carried out against ISIL, if they don't know that towns like Sinjar that were controlled by ISIL have been taken back, or that a town like Tikrit, that was controlled by ISIL, now has been repopulated by previous residents, then they might feel as if there's not enough of a response,\u201d he said, using the other common acronym for the group.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "For nearly a month, the White House has waged a multi-faceted messaging campaign to convince the American public, and the world at large, that President Obama has the right plan for destroying ISIS.", "title": "Is Obama\u2019s Strategy Working?
