Senior ends high school career with third, fifth-place finishes

THORNTON — Long after he's gone and pursuing whatever passion comes after swimming, people will remember his name.

Ryan Ball.

A captivating personality out of the pool, and a force in it, Ball left his mark one last time in the city's swimming annals in his final state meet Saturday.

Chasing after that elusive state championship, Ball knew his best was a must, and even then nothing was guaranteed. As he'd done so many times before, Ball delivered.

He swam a city-record time of 1:50.58 in the 200-yard individual medley relay, placing him third at the 5A Boys Swim and Dive Championships.

"I was so excited. Going in I was extremely nervous and my goal was to get that record," he said. "To look up at the board and see that; it was a great experience and something I won't forget."

The state title once again remained just out of reach for Ball, who also took third in the 100 butterfly and backstroke as a junior the year before. Loveland's coach, Jon Scott, said Ball's time would have been good enough to win most years.

Unfortunately for him, this wasn't most years.

"The state meet has gotten so fast, and just to be in that top eight, to be competing against some of those guys, it's a treat," Ball said. "To make the podium, it was something I can say I'm proud of."

Ball would also have a chance at a state championship in the 500 freestyle, another race in which the school record bears his name.

Again, the competition was stiff and Ball's effort came just short of a championship, finishing in fifth place with a 4:37.23, his second-best time.

He pushed himself during his senior season by competing in the two toughest races, and said he gave it all had and left with no regrets.

"It's a state meet that I'll always keep with me," he said. "It was an amazing experience. Some people don't swim high school, they just do club, and I would never trade the memories I've made in high school, friends I've made, experiences I've had."

The feeling flows both ways.

"Ryan's our team leader and performed like one throughout the whole meet," Scott said. "He's definitely leaving a lasting impact on the team and community."

Ball's presence will be missed for the Indians going forward, but Saturday gave the future some valuable lessons that will pay dividends next season and beyond.

Sophomore Jackson Buyers made it back to the second day for the first time in his career in the 100 backstroke, finishing seventh in the consolation finals in a personal-best 54.54.

Loveland's two relays, the 200 medley and 400 free, swam their best times with a 12th-place 1:39.28 and 15th 3:17.87.

"It was a really good learning experience. I got to see a guy swim a 47 in the 100 back and learned I really need to work on my kick outs if I'm ever going to get that fast," Buyers said. "I also learned I really need to focus on the little things, because that race was so close and if I would have done just one little thing better, I could've been fourth of fifth instead of seventh."
