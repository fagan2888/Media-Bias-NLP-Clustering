× Richard Showers Center Meeting on Huntsville Public Housing Rescheduled

HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (WHNT) – A public meeting at the Richard Showers Center to discuss proposed construction of 120 new public housing units in Huntsville has been postponed for the fourth time.

In a deal with the Huntsville Public Housing Authority, Work Force Housing is proposing to build a total of 120 public housing units – 40 each on Research Park Boulevard, Winchester Road and Newson Road.

Representatives for councilman Richard Showers say the meeting was postponed again at the advice of the county due to Wednesday’s special election.

Because the Showers Center is also a polling place, it was advised no other activities be scheduled for voting day.

Richard Showers will announce the new date for the public forum at Thursday night’s Huntsville City Council meeting.
