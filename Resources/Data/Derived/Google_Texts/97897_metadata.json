Bill Owens, said the process is set up to kill legislation.\n\n\u201cIt is much more difficult to pass a bill than to kill it,\u201d said Beasley, president of 5280 Strategies, LLC. \u201cIt\u2019s just a fact, and it\u2019s probably a good thing. This process is designed to scrutinize ideas before they become law in Colorado.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s tougher to explain is why lobbyists are worse at passing bills than average. This session bills that passed and those that died were nearly evenly split \u2014 47 percent became law and 53 percent died somewhere along the process, according to a database from legislative staff tracking bill outcomes.\n\nColorado State University political science professor John Straayer theorized that bills with heavy lobbying were more controversial and therefore much harder to get through the system.\n\n\u201cI just think in general the institutional structure and process is built to stop more stuff than to pass stuff,\u201d said Straayer, whose students often analyze the lobbying disclosures for his class. \u201cIn a committee, you only deal with five, seven, nine or 11 members, and on the floor it only takes turning three or four members to stop it. If there\u2019s a lot of money on both sides of the issue, you\u2019re probably going to get it killed.\u201d\n\nThe amount of lobbying support or opposition does affect the likelihood of success, the Watchdog.org analysis found. If a bill had twice as much or more lobbyist support than opposition, the success rate bumped up to 35 percent \u2014 still 12 percentage points less than the average success rate. But if a bill had overwhelming lobbying opposition, the kill-rate jumped to 95 percent, meaning if lobbyists didn\u2019t like your bill it was almost always dead in the water.\n\nRELATED: Special interests spend big but most don\u2019t want to talk about it.\n\nUsing a database of disclosures in which lobbyists indicated support, opposition or bills they were monitoring or amending, Watchdog.org matched a bill\u2019s number to a legislative database that indicated what happened to the bill by the end of the session. Counting the net total indications of support versus opposition revealed the bills got an overwhelming lobby \u2014 for or against.\n\nOne caveat in the analysis is that lobbyists often indicate they are monitoring a bill they oppose or hope to modify, but there was no way to statistically analyze those bills without to talking to dozens of lobbyists about hundreds of bills. Nearly all the lobbyists Watchdog.org contacted for these stories did not return calls and emails seeking comment.\n\nNevertheless, the sponsors of heavily lobbied bills often don\u2019t know the level of lobbying until it\u2019s too late.\n\nState Rep. Janak Joshi, R-Colorado Springs, sponsored a bill to close the Affordable Care Act state exchange in Colorado, which became the most lobbied-against bill this session.\n\nWhile the bill realistically never had a chance of passing the Democrat-controlled House, the database showed 69 lobbyists indicated opposition to House Bill 1066; only one supported it and nearly 30 monitored it. Over the five-month session, lobbyist indicated opposition to the bill more than 460 times, the reports show.\n\n\u201cLobbying was extremely important, and lobbying is what passed (the exchange) in the first place,\u201d said Joshi, conceding he was surprised at the level of opposition. \u201cThey also know that as long as Democrats are in control, it\u2019s going to die.\u201d\n\nDespite that, Joshi promised to bring the legislation back next year because he believes the exchange is a huge waste of tax money, and an audit prompted by legislation that did pass this year \u2014 Senate Bill 19 \u2014 will uncover more problems with the state nonprofit that runs the health exchange.\n\nAcross the aisle, Rep. KC Becker\u2019s proposal to fund long-term but reversible birth control had overwhelming support \u2014 53 lobbyists indicated support more than 400 times in monthly disclosures over the five-month session. Only two lobbyists indicated opposition to the bill, and about a dozen monitored it.\n\nDespite that the support, House Bill 1194 died in the Senate State, Veterans and Military Affairs committee.\n\n\u201cI know there was a lot of support, but I don\u2019t know the exact hours spent lobbying,\u201d said Becker, D-Boulder, adding the bill would have decreased poverty, costs for Medicaid and the need for many abortions.\n\nBecker said she found that if certain groups, such as Colorado Union of Taxpayers or the Principles of Liberty, are opposed, Republicans take notice.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how many people are lobbying against,\u201d she said. \u201cIt matters who\u2019s lobbying against it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Colorado lobbyists are good a killing bills but not as proficient at passing laws their clients want on the books, a Watchdog analysis of lobbying records shows.", "title": "How effective are lobbyists in Colorado at passing, killing legislation? - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/07/capitol-full-e1437010573452.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-16T08:49:50+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/227933/effective-lobbyists-colorado-passing-killing-legislation/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Colorado", "tag": "healthcare exchange bill,lawmakers,Lobbying,Special Interests", "published_time": "2015-07-16T04:00:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-16T08:49:50+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Colorado lobbyists are good a killing bills but not as proficient at passing laws their clients want on the books, a Watchdog analysis of lobbying records shows.", "title": "How effective are lobbyists in Colorado at passing, killing legislation? - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/07/capitol-full-e1437010573452.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Colorado lobbyists are good a killing bills but not as proficient at passing laws their clients want on the books, a Watchdog analysis of lobbying records shows."}, "article_summary": "Nearly all the lobbyists Watchdog.org contacted for these stories did not return calls and emails seeking comment.\nOnly two lobbyists indicated opposition to the bill, and about a dozen monitored it.\nAcross the aisle, Rep.
