Medical marijuana was among the hot button issues discussed during an all-day news event at the Capitol.\n\nBondi has never hidden the fact she\u2019s opposed to a medical marijuana amendment that will now be put on the ballot, after it was upheld earlier this week by the Florida Supreme Court. Her office failed to persuade the high court to stop the ballot language on the grounds she felt it was misleading. Still, Bondi says she\u2019ll vote no on the amendment in November, and House Democratic Leader Perry Thurston says that\u2019s her right.\n\n\u201cBut, my problem is more with \u2018why are you opposing giving the people the opportunity to vote on the issue?\u2019 Is it because we\u2019ve heard a certain segment of the community will be voting for this party as opposed to that party. That\u2019s what I have a problem with! Political partisan agenda\u2026are you supporting the people,\u201d asked Thurston.\n\nThurston, who\u2019s vying for Bondi\u2019s seat in upcoming election, says while she\u2019s helping with pill mill and anti-human trafficking efforts, Bondi has a duty to be the \u201cpeople\u2019s attorney.\u201d He says she\u2019s not up to the task and points to what he calls missteps like getting the governor to cancel an execution scheduled for the same day she had a political fundraiser.\n\n\"Regardless of what you think about the death penalty or what your position is, it's the victim's family who have prepared themselves, who have made the effort to make sure they're in a position to receive this final justice and for a fundraiser? And, then to convince the Governor to go along with it? Yeah, he wears this as well,\" added Thurston.\n\nAnother Democratic challenger gunning for her seat is George Sheldon. He\u2019s served in state government as a former Florida Department of Children and Families Secretary and on the federal level as an assistant Secretary for the Administration for Children and Families. But he says he resigned that position because he feels he needs to come back to Florida to replace Bondi.\n\n\u201cAn Attorney General, not only fighting the Affordable Care Act, can philosophically agree the rollout was bad, but basically saying we\u2019re going to challenge this in court and spend millions of dollars, passed by both Houses of Congress, where citizens today are covered for pre-existing conditions who never were before...,\u201d said Sheldon.\n\nHe also criticized Bondi for not placing enough emphasis on white collar crime.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very concerned, for instance, about the open investigation on the cyber university owned by Donald Trump, and then that investigation kind of evaporating after a $25,000 contribution was made. I think we need to be very careful not to develop a pay-to-play mindset. If you open an investigation, I think an Attorney General should not accept any contributions from that company,\u201d added Sheldon.\n\nAccording to an October Tampa Bay Times article, a political committee associated with Bondi accepted a $25,000 dollar contribution from Donald Trump, even though she was reviewing whether to work alongside New York\u2019s Attorney General against get-rich quick schemes linked to Trump. But Bondi called those claims, in her words, \u201cuntrue\u201d and \u201cdespicable.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne complaint in 2011, closed out by Citizens Services, is not an active investigation. And, I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s completely misleading and insulting to say that I took a campaign contribution\u2014and let me give you his quote, because I wrote it down\u2014that I would make an investigation evaporate? Come on,\u201d said Bondi.\n\nAnd, as for the medical marijuana issue, Bondi says it was her job as Attorney General to let residents know what they were reading. She says now that the court has ruled, she will not campaign against the amendment anymore.\n\n\u201cMy job, my official duty has ended\u2014I accept the court\u2019s ruling\u2014but, what I do ask is I encourage all voters not to just read what\u2019s on the ballot, read the entire amendment,\u201d added Bondi.\n\n\"Also, look at all the unscrupulous doctors that have been out there with the pill mills. I don't want those guys to come right back in the state and start opening marijuana clinics on every corner and taking advantage of our kids.\"\n\nBondi also talked about some of her 2014 legislative priorities, including a consumer protection bill, more anti-human trafficking efforts, and legislation aimed at another crackdown on synthetic drugs. Bondi along with Thurston and Sheldon made their remarks at the 20th annual legislative planning meeting hosted by the Associated Press Wednesday.\n\nFor more news updates, follow Sascha Cordner on Twitter: @SaschaCordner.", "article_metadata": {"category": "State News", "description": "The Florida Attorney General\u2019s race is heating up as incumbent AG Pam Bondi sparred Wednesday with two Democrats running to oppose her.
