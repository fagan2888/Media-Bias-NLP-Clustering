In the past, India has provided logistics assistance to the U.S. on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe previous Manmohan Singh government balked at signing the foundational defense agreements. This was largely due to the influence of former Defense Minister A.K. Antony\u2014a left-leaning politician with little interest in enhancing ties with the U.S. and who was loath to pursue policies that might irk the Chinese.\n\nThere has always been underlying concern in India that signing the agreements would somehow sacrifice India\u2019s military independence and provide the U.S. with too much information on India\u2019s operational abilities and practices.\n\nSuch concerns are magnified by the U.S. continued close relationship with Pakistan. In fact, some observers feared that the Obama administration\u2019s recent announcement to provide Pakistan with eight additional F-16 aircraft, despite India\u2019s strong objections, could impact New Delhi\u2019s decision on whether to sign the defense agreements.\n\nThe announcement of a preliminary logistics agreement thus sends a positive signal on the overall trajectory of their defense relationship, while stopping short of conveying a major breakthrough.\n\nThe announcement of the F-16 sale notwithstanding, there has been a qualitative improvement in U.S.-India relations under the Modi government, with most progress occurring on the defense front.\n\nCarter has been a driving force behind this effort, especially through advancement of the Defense Trade and Technology Initiative (DTTI) aimed at breaking down bureaucratic and other barriers to U.S.-India defense trade and cooperation.\n\nThe U.S. Congress also is pushing for stronger U.S.-India defense ties. In March, U.S. Representative George Holding, R-N.C., introduced the U.S.-India Defense Technology and Partnership Act. The legislation lays out specific steps for enhancing defense ties between the two countries, including designating a point person to coordinate the interagency policy process regarding defense trade and technology transfer with India; facilitating the transfer of advanced technology for combined military planning; coordinating with India on contingency planning on mutual security threats; and amending the Arms Export Control Act to streamline the export control process for India, putting it on par with NATO countries and other key U.S. military allies.\n\nSome U.S. strategists may be skeptical of the idea of treating India the same as a NATO partner or treaty ally, but Washington must increasingly factor in the evolving security situation with regard to China and the need for countries like India to play a key role in helping to maintain the balance of power in Asia. To fulfill this role, India needs adequate defense capabilities and access to advanced military technology.\n\nLast December, Carter said U.S.-India defense ties could provide an \u201canchor of global security.\u201d This week\u2019s visit and the preliminary agreement on sharing military logistics represent a modest step toward the realization of the defense secretary\u2019s worthy vision.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Last December Carter said U.S.-India defense ties could provide an \u201canchor of global security.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Last December Carter said U.S.-India defense ties could provide an \u201canchor of global security.\u201d", "title": "US Looks to Improve Defense Ties With India", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160413_Carter_RK.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-13T23:27:24+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1SaG4VY"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Last December Carter said U.S.-India defense ties could provide an \u201canchor of global security.\u201d", "title": "US Looks to Improve Defense Ties With India", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160413_Carter_RK.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "diplomacy", "published_time": "2016-04-13T06:09:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-13T23:27:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "India, US, Defense"}, "article_summary": "The U.S. Congress also is pushing for stronger U.S.-India defense ties.\nIn March, U.S. Representative George Holding, R-N.C., introduced the U.S.-India Defense Technology and Partnership Act.\nTo fulfill this role, India needs adequate defense capabilities and access to advanced military technology.\nLast December, Carter said U.S.-India defense ties could provide an \u201canchor of global security.\u201d This week\u2019s visit and the preliminary agreement on sharing military logistics represent a modest step toward the realization of the defense secretary\u2019s worthy vision.\nA preliminary agreement between Washington and New Delhi to share military logistics marks another step forward in their defense relationship, assuming the agreement is soon formalized."}
