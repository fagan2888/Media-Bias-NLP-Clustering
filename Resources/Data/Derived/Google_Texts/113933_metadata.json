The did not show either the warning or hopeful signs that many economists anticipated.\n\nThe good news: Despite the U.S. economy shrinking in the first quarter\u2013its first quarterly contraction in three years\u2013job growth remained healthy. Employers added 217,000 jobs and the unemployment held steady at 6.3 percent. Job growth occurred in many sectors with the fastest growth in the professional and business services (+55,000) and healthcare and social assistance (+55,000) sectors. And wages rose modestly.\n\nTaken together, the labor market shows no signs of heading into a recession. This makes it more likely the Q1 GDP report represented an aberration, not a harbinger of worse to come.\n\nThe bad news: Labor force participation flat-lined, despite expectations among economists this rate would increase. Participation in the labor force had fallen almost half a percentage point in April. To put this in perspective, participation rates have not been lower since the Carter administration \u2013 when far fewer women worked outside the home.\n\nMany economists thought this represented statistical noise and participation would bounce back in May. If this had occurred, unemployment might have increased, since only those looking for work count as unemployed, and may have indicated a strengthening labor market since more people were looking for jobs. But that too did not happen. The headline unemployment rate has fallen primarily because millions of Americans have stopped looking for work.\n\nThe May jobs report shows a Goldilocks\u2019 economy: not that cold but not that hot. Adding 200,000 jobs a month would be good news if unemployment and labor force participation stood at normal levels. Unfortunately they do not.\n\nAll told, the U.S. economy does not appear headed for another recession, but is not healing quickly either.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Participation in the labor force had fallen almost half a percentage point in April.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Participation in the labor force had fallen almost half a percentage point in April.", "title": "Jobs Report: Lowest Percentage of Workers in Decades", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014_06_06_MayJobs_Sherk.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-06-06T23:03:27+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1usw6mn"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Participation in the labor force had fallen almost half a percentage point in April.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014_06_06_MayJobs_Sherk.jpg"}, "title": "Jobs Report: Lowest Percentage of Workers in Decades", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "jobs", "published_time": "2014-06-06T12:32:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-06T23:03:27+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe18b7\"", "article_summary": "The bad news: Labor force participation flat-lined, despite expectations among economists this rate would increase.\nParticipation in the labor force had fallen almost half a percentage point in April.\nThere was good news and bad news in today\u2019s jobs report, and both came from what the report did not show.\nAdding 200,000 jobs a month would be good news if unemployment and labor force participation stood at normal levels.\nThe May jobs report shows a Goldilocks\u2019 economy: not that cold but not that hot."}
