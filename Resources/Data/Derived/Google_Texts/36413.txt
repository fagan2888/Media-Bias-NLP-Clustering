— Cary Diagnostic Radiology, a practice that closed in June to the chagrin of long-time patients who were left without access to their records and scans, added hours to accommodate those people.

Dr. Christopher Tharrington, who took over the facility eight years ago, filed for bankruptcy in April. Earlier this week, visitors found a sign on the door listing hours when patients could pick up copies of their records – Monday through Friday of this week from 10 a.m. to noon.

On Friday, that sign had been updated to extend those hours through 2 p.m. and added pick-up times Monday and Tuesday from 1 to 5 p.m.

Tharrington said he planned to add another person to help with the requests and to add even more hours next week.

Patients need to go to the office to make a request and return the next business day.

Margaret Harding was among those who had a hard time getting records released. After waiting an hour on Friday, she got results.

"I feel good now, and I'm so glad these other people are going to be able to get their records," Harding said. "I'm ready to go to the next place to continue my appointments."

Tharrington said he was working on long-term plans for patients to access their records. According to the state Medical Board, doctors have a professional obligation to notify patients when they leave the practice and give them an opportunity to obtain their medical records.
