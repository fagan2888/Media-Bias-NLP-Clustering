In fact, right now it doesn\u2019t even want to be one.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean the world\u2019s most populous country doesn\u2019t pose a threat to the planet\u2019s wealthiest and most powerful one. Yes, the United States and China are at odds, mostly as a result of China\u2019s expanding definition of what comprises its territory in the western Pacific, and how that expansion threatens U.S. allies and the postwar economic order Washington was instrumental in creating.\n\nChina, however, still could not meet and match the U.S. military on a global battlefront. Beijing lacks the expertise, military doctrine and equipment to do so. The Chinese military has no recent combat experience and, as a consequence, its training regimens are unrealistic.\n\nBeijing\u2019s army, navy and air force may be flush with new equipment, but much of it is based on designs that Chinese government hackers and agents stole from the United States and other countries. Most of it has never been exposed to the rigors of actual combat, so it\u2019s unclear how well it would actually work.\n\nBut that might not matter. China has no interest in deploying and fighting across the globe, as the United States does. Beijing is preparing to fight along its own borders and especially in the China seas, a far easier task for its inexperienced troops.\n\nBecause, with all its military handicaps, in its own region China could be capable of beating U.S. forces in battle.\n\nThe critical question is just how much the Pentagon should care.\n\nActive defense\n\nThe brutal Japanese invasion and occupation of China during the 1930s and 1940s had a profound effect on modern China\u2019s development. Prior to the mid-1980s, China\u2019s military strategy was focused on one great fear \u2014 another invasion, in this case an overland attack by the Soviet Union.\n\nCommensurate with the threat, Beijing\u2019s military organization emphasized short-range, defensive ground forces. In essence, a Great Wall of men and metal.\n\nThe danger from the Soviet Union ebbed and, in 1985, the Chinese Communist Party revised its war strategy. The \u201cactive defense\u201d doctrine sought to move the fighting away from the Chinese heartland. It shifted attention from China\u2019s western land border to its eastern sea frontier \u2014 including Taiwan, which in the eyes of Beijing\u2019s ruling Communist Party is a breakaway province.\n\nBut the new strategy was still largely defensive. \u201cWe attack only after being attacked,\u201d the Chinese navy asserted in its contribution to the official active-defense doctrine. It\u2019s worth noting that, in the party\u2019s view, a formal announcement of full independence by Taiwan would be an \u201cattack\u201d on China\u2019s integrity, justifying a retaliatory attack on the island nation.\n\nThirty years later, Beijing is still pursuing its offshore defense, if at a greater distance. It now encompasses island territory that China dared not actively claim until recently. Still, the strategy remains the same.\n\nWhich is why, for all the hundreds of billions of dollars Beijing has spent on its armed forces since the Chinese economy really took off in the late 1990s and 2000s \u2014 and even taking into account equipment optimized for an amphibious assault on Taiwan \u2014 Beijing still acquires mostly short-range, defensive weaponry.\n\nWhich is how China can possess the world\u2019s second-biggest fleet of jet fighters after the United States \u2014 1,500 jets versus Washington\u2019s 2,800 \u2014 but only a mere handful of the aerial tankers that refuel fighters in mid-air, allowing them to fight battles far from their bases.\n\nThe U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps together operate more than 500 tankers. Because America fights all over the world.\n\nSimilarly, China\u2019s navy is huge. With some 300 warships, it is second in strength only to the 500 vessels in service with the U.S. Navy and Military Sealift Command, which operates America\u2019s transport and spy ships. But the Chinese navy, like its air force, is a short-range force. Beijing\u2019s fleet includes just six logistics ships capable of refueling and resupplying other ships at sea, extending their sailing range.\n\nAmerica\u2019s fleet includes more than 30 such vessels.\n\nThe upshot of Beijing\u2019s emphasis on short-range forces is that the farther its troops fight from the Chinese mainland, the less effective they will be. It doesn\u2019t help that Beijing has few close allies, which means virtually no overseas bases it can count on during conflicts. The Pentagon, by contrast, maintains many hundreds of overseas facilities.\n\nChinese forces simply cannot cross the ocean to confront the U.S. military in America\u2019s own backyard. Nor does Beijing even want to do so. Meanwhile, U.S. forces routinely patrol within miles of China\u2019s airspace and national waters, and Washington has taken it on itself to be the decisive if not dominant military power on every continent.\n\nIn the western Pacific, however, China does threaten U.S. military standing. The flipside of possessing a defensive, short-range navy and air force is that Beijing can quickly concentrate numerous forces across a relatively small geographic area. The large numbers help China compensate for the overall poor quality of its forces.\n\nBy contrast, the United States \u2014 because it must project forces over great distances and usually is in the process of doing so all around the world \u2014 can usually deploy only a small number of ships and planes to any particular place at any given time. Because they would be badly outnumbered, it might not matter that U.S. ships and planes are generally superior to their Chinese counterparts in a one-on-one fight.\n\nIn a landmark analysis in 2008, the RAND Corporation, a California think tank, concluded that China would have a huge numerical advantage over the United States in any aerial battle near Taiwan. The size of the advantage would depend on whether U.S. forces staged from Kadena Air Base in Japan or Andersen Air Force Base in Guam. \u201cChina could enjoy a 3:1 edge in fighters if we can fly from Kadena,\u201d the analysis warned, \u201cabout 10:1 if forced to operate from Andersen.\u201d The report goes on to note that while American warplanes are generally technologically superior to their Chinese counterparts, they\u2019re not 10 times superior.\n\nSecond island chain\n\nBut if China\u2019s strategy is defensive, this argument goes, then the United States would only risk defeat in battle with the Chinese if Washington attacked first. And America wouldn\u2019t ever attack China, right?\n\nThe depends on the definition of \u201cattack.\u201d Assault the Chinese mainland? Most certainly not. But the United States and most other countries equate an attack on their interests with an attack on their soil. And increasingly, China is expanding the definition of its interests and the extent of its soil.\n\nFor one, if Taiwan ever formally announced its independence \u2014 and make no mistake, Taiwan is already fully independent \u2014 China vows it would invade. Because the integrity of historical China, including the island of Formosa that became Taiwan in 1949, is firmly within China\u2019s current definition of its core interests.\n\nChina also claims islands in the East and South China seas that Taiwan, Vietnam, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei are claiming. The islands themselves are essentially beside the point; it\u2019s the waters around them, and the oil and natural gas below that the countries are so eager to secure for themselves.\n\nThough those disputes are not new, as China\u2019s economy and military have developed, its claims have grown more assertive. In late 2014, China greatly escalated these territorial disputes when it began dredging isolated reefs in contested waters, piling sand into artificial islands, atop which it built piers, airstrips and other military facilities, transforming the islands into outposts.\n\nThe outposts make it increasingly unlikely the claimant countries will find easy, peaceful solutions to their conflicts.\n\nThe United States maintains military alliances with Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, Vietnam. Washington is also committed to maintaining freedom of navigation for commercial ships in international waters \u2014 a key factor of global free trade. If any of the above countries goes to war with China, the United States could get drawn in, too. And on China\u2019s turf, where Beijing\u2019s short-range forces are most useful.\n\nFighting in its own region, China is a military power to be reckoned with. Fighting far from home against U.S. troops, the Chinese would be hopelessly outmatched, assuming they could even reach the battlefield.\n\nThe trick for the United States is to avoid going to war with China on China\u2019s terms without also surrendering the western Pacific to Chinese control. That means talk \u2014 backed up by the threat of force. \u201cThe United States seeks to develop a constructive relationship with China,\u201d the Pentagon states in its China report, \u201cthat promotes security and prosperity in Asia and around the world.\u201d\n\nThe report continues: \u201cAt the same time, the strategy acknowledges there will be areas of competition, and underscores that the United States will manage this competition with China from a position of strength.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s a bluff in this approach. In the only region where China\u2019s actions pose a serious threat to U.S. interests, Washington struggles to maintain a position of strength. Beijing has carefully matched clear and restrained strategic goals with more than adequate military means.\n\nThat\u2019s a powerful combination.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/24/Despite-Its-Roar-China-s-Military-Paper-Tiger", "type": "article", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03262012_USA_vs_China_article.jpg", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "title": "Despite Its Roar, China\u2019s Military Is a Paper Tiger"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/24/Despite-Its-Roar-China-s-Military-Paper-Tiger", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03262012_USA_vs_China_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbe6e\"", "article_summary": "The Chinese military has no recent combat experience and, as a consequence, its training regimens are unrealistic.\nPrior to the mid-1980s, China\u2019s military strategy was focused on one great fear \u2014 another invasion, in this case an overland attack by the Soviet Union.\n2) In military terms, China is a paper dragon that, despite its apparent strength, is powerless to intervene in world events far from its shores.\nThe United States maintains military alliances with Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, Vietnam.\nChinese forces simply cannot cross the ocean to confront the U.S. military in America\u2019s own backyard."}
