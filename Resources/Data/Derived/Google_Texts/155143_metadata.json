About 12 percent were Westerners from more than 200 cruise ships that docked in 2013, according to tour operators. Virtually all of those dockings have been canceled this year.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that Yalta \u2014 indeed, much of Crimea \u2014 fell prey first to the Soviet penchant for concrete and then to the more modern plague of endlessly homogeneous chain stores and apartment blocks. The place needs a little work, and many here hope that the Kremlin will provide it.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn April, Mr. Putin announced that he had ordered the price of round-trip airplane tickets for vacationers from Russia slashed to $214, compared with a normal fare of about $385 from Moscow, and subsidized train tickets. State-run companies like Gazprom and Rosneft said they would underwrite vacations for tens of thousands of employees.\n\nSome Russians who work for government-owned companies have told their friends that they were ordered to vacation in Crimea this year. State-run television inaugurated a relentless campaign plugging the peninsula: Caves! Waterfalls! Palaces! Yuri Gagarin vacationed here! (Gagarin, the first man in space, remains a Russian archetype, used to plug almost any state goal.)\n\nBut even Mr. Putin spoke bluntly about the limits of its attractions.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t offer cheap tickets, people simply won\u2019t go,\u201d he said in announcing the subsidies. \u201cGiven its current infrastructure, Crimea is designed for people with small incomes.\u201d\n\nSunshine, agriculture and the dilapidated Black Sea fleet are the three main pillars the Kremlin expects to exploit in its push to transform Crimea into an economic success story that proves the benefits of Mother Russia\u2019s embrace. There has also been talk of casinos.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPropping up Crimea will be a difficult, expensive effort. Russia has earmarked $5 billion just to save the Black Sea fleet from the scrap heap. Agricultural exports face transportation issues because the peninsula is geographically remote from Russia.\n\nBut tourism presents some of the biggest challenges. After being the playground of royalty, Crimea remained a cherished summer vacation destination in the Soviet Union, as few Soviets were allowed to travel abroad. It offered some of the only warm beaches available. So tourism has long been a cornerstone of the economy.\n\nTraditionally, a vast majority of tourists arrived by train, with most Russians crossing through Ukraine. For the past two months, however, television news in Russia, monopolized by the state, has depicted Ukraine as brimming with neo-Nazis bent on shedding Russian blood. The threat was largely invented, but it frightened potential visitors.\n\nInitially, Russia and its allies running Crimea vowed to match, if not increase, the number of tourists from last year, but they then began to scale back expectations. The acting head of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, was recently quoted telling local reporters that the government expected at least three million tourists.\n\nAs if to hedge their bets, Mr. Putin and his allies wasted no time in accusing Ukraine of benign neglect. Ukraine received Crimea from Moscow in 1954, then ruled the area for 23 years after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. Moscow blames Kiev for every flaw, from the decrepit ships Russia seized to low agricultural exports, which Mr. Putin said dropped 60 percent under Ukrainian rule.\n\nRussian government inspectors, the president lamented during a recent national television broadcast, found Crimea\u2019s hotels and resorts terribly shabby.\n\nBELARUS RUSSIA Kiev UKRAINE Dnieper River MOLDOVA CRIMEA Yalta Black Sea TURKEY\n\n\u201cSome of these, if not all, cannot be used under Russian sanitary and epidemiological standards,\u201d Mr. Putin said. (This in a place once famous for sanitariums.)\n\nHe went on: \u201cWhen they asked how former vacationers could have put up with this sort of quality, they heard this odd, and shameful, answer: \u2018It\u2019s O.K., we mostly had miners as guests here. It made no difference to them; they\u2019d down half a glass of vodka and go to the beach.\u2019 But we can\u2019t take this approach with Russian vacationers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTour operators said the legions of Russian tourists wanting to lounge could find far nicer beaches, bigger buffets and better hotels in convenient, inexpensive destinations like Turkey or Egypt, safely distant from the urban unrest in those countries.\n\n\u201cThe whole idea of tourism in this area is a little different,\u201d said Sergei V. Ivashin, the young general director of a Moscow franchise for Pegas Touristik, a major Russian tour operator. \u201cCrimea is not for people who want to lie on the beach in Egypt and eat eight meals a day, but people who want to see the culture and history of their own land, their own country. We are aiming for those kinds of nationalist tours.\u201d\n\nThere is plenty of Russian history here. The biggest draw, with 782,000 visitors in 2013, according to the Tourism Ministry, is Livadia, the Italian Renaissance palace the last czar, Nicholas II, erected in 1911.\n\nBut Crimea has definitely seen better times.\n\nTake Chekhov\u2019s home. The writer settled here in 1898, drawn, like so many, to treat his tuberculosis. He built a modest white house.\n\nHe wrote \u201cThe Cherry Orchard\u201d and \u201cThree Sisters\u201d here, among other works. Sergei Rachmaninoff accompanied the opera bass Fyodor Chaliapin on Chekhov\u2019s black upright piano. Leo Tolstoy visited. Unlike many Russian museums ransacked during the 1917 revolution, this one still has authentic furnishings because Chekhov\u2019s sister and his widow lived here for decades after his death in 1904.\n\nBut giant apartment towers have encroached on Chekhov\u2019s unbroken view of the sea and have badly affected the house itself. When cracks developed about 18 months ago, museum officials went to court to stop the construction of a nearby apartment building, guides said.\n\nThe heady mix of literary, political and military history helped Mr. Putin win wide support among Russians for taking Crimea back. Peddling its beaches, however bedraggled, could lift that support even further. And experts cite another factor in Crimea\u2019s favor: warmth.\n\nIn oft-frozen Russia, no ruler can really do wrong by adding hundreds of miles of warm beachfront property, said Natalya V. Zubarevich, a professor at Moscow State University who specializes in social and political geography. \u201cThe result would not have been the same if he had added Alaska.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140524200458, "twitter": {"description": "With its economy flatlining, Crimea desperately needs a banner year in tourism.
