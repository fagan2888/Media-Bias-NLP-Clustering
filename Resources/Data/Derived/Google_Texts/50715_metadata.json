It's been since 2007 since I had my eyes checked.\"\n\nHarris is among the estimated 280,000 residents who'd be eligible for Republican Gov. Bill Haslam's proposed Insure Tennessee plan to fund health care using $1.2 billion in annual expanded federal Medicaid funding through the Affordable Care Act that Democratic President Barack Obama signed into law. Haslam earlier this year was unable to persuade the GOP-controlled Tennessee General Assembly to approve his plan.\n\nWhile the legislation remains on hold, advocates for the bill will hold a nonpartisan community forum about Insure Tennessee at 5:30 p.m. Tuesday at Olive Branch Church, 1115 Minerva Drive in Murfreesboro.\n\nInsure Tennessee backers\n\nOne of the plan's supporters is Dr. Chris Dunlap, the medical director at the Saint Louise Clinic, which provides family health care for those with and without insurance.\n\nBuy Photo Dr. Chris Dunlap, the medical director of the Saint Louise Clinic and UT Family Medicine Residency Program (Photo: Scott Broden / DNJ)\n\nSince opening in 2011, the clinic has gone from treating 2,500 in its first full year to an estimated 10,000 in this fiscal year, which will end June 30, for a fast-growing Murfreesboro, said Dunlap, who also is the director of the UT (University of Tennessee) Family Medicine Residency Program, which trains eight medical school graduates at the clinic at 1020 N. Highland Ave. in Murfreesboro.\n\n\"Our purpose is to take care of patients regardless of their ability to pay,\" said Dunlap, whose clinic provides services in a city that reached a U.S. Census estimated population of 120,954 in 2014. \"In doing that, we are trying to meet a need in our community.\"\n\nThe clinic has gone from having 78 percent of its patients without health care insurance to 50 percent since the Affordable Care Act was implemented a couple of years ago, Dunlap said.\n\n\"We are still obligated to care for them morally,\" said Dunlap, whose clinic is a part of the nonprofit Saint Thomas Health, which includes Saint Thomas Rutherford Hospital on Medical Center Parkway in Murfreesboro.\n\nAlthough Tennessee lawmakers have not accepted expanded Medicaid funds, many people have been able to buy insurance with the help of tax subsidies through an exchange authorized by the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"That still leaves us with part of the population not covered at all,\" Dunlap said. \"They are left in the gap. It left a lot of people uncovered.\"\n\nThe uninsured\n\nThose uncovered at this time include Harris, who lost his job with Taylor Farms vegetable packaging operation in 2011 because his health problems prevented him from working, he said.\n\nBuy Photo Jerry Harris lacks health insurance.

(Photo: Helen Comer / DNJ)\n\nHarris had previously thought he had qualified for TennCare, which is the state's plan to help low-income residents pay for health care using existing Medicaid funding from the federal government.\n\n\"They had me going back and forth, but nothing got solved,\" said Harris, noting that he had worked his entire adult life before being ill.\n\nHe learned that only cancer patients, the elderly, the disabled, those with children or pregnant mothers are eligible for TennCare while not exceeding Medicaid-defined income limits for each category, said Sarah Tanksley, a spokeswoman for the state health insurance service.\n\nIf Insure Tennessee becomes law, it will help two groups of people obtain health insurance.\n\nIn one group, people who are unable to afford health insurance provided through their jobs will have a voucher to help them pay for their employer plan, Tanksley said.\n\nInsure Tennessee for the other group offers incentives for people \"to make choices that help them be accountable for their own health care,\" such as not going to an expensive hospital emergency room for nonemergency health care, Tanksley said.\n\nAnother incentive is for smokers to participate in a tobacco cessation program, said Tanksley, noting that the goal is for people to have \"skin in the game\" when it comes to making healthy lifestyle choices to help cover the cost of their premiums for being part of the plan.\n\nAlthough lawmakers worry that Insure Tennessee could lead to a tax increase request to pay for the state match for the Medicaid expansion, the Tennessee Hospital Association has agreed that their members will cover the nonfederal costs through hospital assessment fees, Tanksley added.\n\nThe federal government would cover 97 percent of Medicaid expansion starting in the next fiscal year, which begins July 1, and the Affordable Care Act calls for the national cut to be phased down to 90 percent of the costs, Tanksley said.\n\nCosts of uninsured\n\nSupporters of Insure Tennessee such as Dunlap see the need because costs make it harder for the health care industry to provide services for many without health insurance.\n\n\"It puts rural hospitals at high risk, and it puts a strain on the big hospitals,\" Dunlap said. \"We are trying to work more efficiently and meet the needs of a growing community.\"\n\nSome of his clinic's patients who need treatment not provided at St. Louise have a difficult time finding surgeons or other specialists willing to provide additional services to those without health insurance, Dunlap said.\n\n\"That need is huge,\" said Dunlap, noting that not all medical practices can afford to provide charity care. \"A lot of doctors will donate their time, but they can't do that for everyone. Clinics like ours are very unique. If we can get uninsured people insurance coverage, then they will have a lot more options than they have currently.\"\n\nPatients such as Harris hope those options will be available.\n\n\"There's no cure for diabetes at this time,\" Harris said while talking about his health problems with his wife, Kim Harris, at the Old Fort Park picnic pavilion.\n\n\"He can't even see a foot specialist because they all want insurance,\" said Kim Harris, adding that her husband also is having problems with his legs, hands and memory. \"It's getting worse.\"\n\nKim Harris also has faced problems with a pinched nerve that affects her arms, and she's even passed out at work with a temporary employment service that doesn't provide health insurance. She also has endured a couple of blood transfusions, but she's more worried about her husband.\n\n\"I just want something for him to get relief when he really needs it,\" she said, adding how her husband has a difficult time participating in family events and depends on motorized scooters when they go to stores. \"He's just tired. He needs insurance. The bills are really piling up. You can only do so much. He needs help.\"\n\nA former Riverdale High School basketball player who graduated in 1989, Jerry Harris said when he was younger he never expected to face health issues today that also include heart failure and a lung problem measured when he participated in a stress test on a treadmill.\n\n\"I couldn't last five minutes,\" he recalled. \"They really need to do something for the people who are really hurting and need it. It's tough.\"\n\nReach Scott Broden at 615-278-5158 and on Twitter @ScottBroden.\n\nInsure Tennessee forum\n\nA nonpartisan community forum about Insure Tennessee will start at 5:30 p.m. Tuesday at Olive Branch Church, 1115 Minerva Drive in Murfreesboro.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.dnj.com/1NGbKSv", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Jerry Harris hopes Insure Tennessee plan will be accepted by lawmakers to help him afford his treatment for\u00a0diabetes and hypertension.", "og": {"site_name": "DNJ", "description": "Jerry Harris hopes Insure Tennessee plan will be accepted by lawmakers to help him afford his treatment for\u00a0diabetes and hypertension.", "title": "Diabetic holds out hope for Insure Tennessee", "url": "http://www.dnj.com/story/news/2015/11/09/diabetic-holds-out-hope-insure-tennessee/75317920/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/dnj.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jerry Harris hopes Insure Tennessee plan will be accepted by lawmakers to help him afford his treatment for\u00a0diabetes and hypertension.", "title": "Diabetic holds out hope for Insure Tennessee", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1b81b3e81c8e3e6d5d283b046c9ccb0670528676/c=439-0-1791-1352&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/11/09/TNGroup/Murfreesboro/635826931407824633-02-Insure-Tennessee.jpg", "creator": "@dnj_com", "site": "@dnj_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=894078678", "fb": {"app_id": 184474251565027}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Tennessee Gov.
