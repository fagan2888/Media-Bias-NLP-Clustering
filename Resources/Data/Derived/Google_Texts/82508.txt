Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber is due to officially resign Wednesday following allegations of influence peddling and shady ‘green energy‘ deals involving him and his girlfriend.

The Governor’s tendered resignation well be effective as of this Wednesday when his next-in-line is sworn in.

Kitzhaber was elected to a record fourth term as Oregon’s Governor in 2014, but things quickly devolved into scandal.

Willamette Week reports Kitzhaber’s girlfriend, Cyvlia Hayes, whom the Governor insisted Oregonians refer to as his ‘First Lady‘, was found to have been given make-work jobs bought and paid for by environmental groups and oil-billionaire-turned-environmentalist Tom Steyer.

Kitzhaber’s alleged crime is exacerbated by the cover up. Willamette Week and KXL Radio first reported Kitzhaber’s staff demanded Oregon officials destroy emails in advance of an investigation.

Hayes is accused of failing to divulge all of her earnings to the IRS and state ethics officials. She has admitted to marrying an illegal alien for money and trying to start a marijuana farm, when it was illegal.

Kitzhaber was already was in political trouble, having overseen hundreds of millions of dollars squandered for a failed ObamaCare website, Cover Oregon, and a failed attempt to build a light rail bridge across the Columbia River.

The Governor is now under investigation by the Oregon State Attorney General’s Office, the Oregon State Ethics Commission, the U.S. Justice Department, and the Congressional Governmental Oversight Committee.
