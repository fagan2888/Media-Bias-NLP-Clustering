Even before high school, Cruz thought about such things. He read the economics classics of Adam Smith, free marketeer Milton Friedman and Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises, a hero to American libertarians. \"His dad pounded into him the idea that you'd better appreciate American freedom,\" says Bill Miller, Cruz's teacher in Sunday school and Bible study classes at Trinity Faith Fellowship in Houston. \"Rafael would say, 'I could leave Cuba to come here \u2014 if you had to leave the United States, where would you go?' \" When Felito was 13, his father signed him up for classes at the Free Enterprise Institute, where he spent hundreds of hours studying the Constitution, the Federalist Papers and other founding documents. He was one of five teens in the institute's constitutional collaborators program, in which kids memorized the Constitution, wrote speeches and performed for Rotary clubs and other groups across Texas. Cruz was the star. (He also acted in high school and was so serious about his craft that he considered going directly from high school to Hollywood. His parents talked him out of that one.) Cruz was always ambitious about rising in politics. \"I don't ever remember a time when I wasn't,\" he says. \"The politic answer is 'I was reluctantly drawn to it.' \" But politics was the main dish at the Cruz dinner table, and Ted's appetite for it was powerful. - - - David Panton was just 16 when he arrived at Princeton from Jamaica, a preacher's son and the first in his family to go to college. The elite campus proved to be a difficult fit. \"I was academically, chronologically and culturally challenged,\" he says. \"I didn't have many friends.\" Neither did Cruz. His assigned roommate freshman year, Craig Mazin, found Cruz cocksure and politically extreme \u2014 an impression shared by others. Some students complained that Ted didn't have an off switch, that he lectured them. Some girls asked Mazin to keep Ted away from them because he was overbearing. Cruz's political ambition was clear. \"He knew what he wanted,\" says Michael Lubetzky, a Canadian who was close to Cruz in college and is now a lawyer in Montreal. \"We talked a lot about the natural-born clause in the Constitution. Ted said when he was a kid, he'd checked to see if he'd be eligible to be president.\" (Being born to a U.S. citizen \u2014 his mother \u2014 automatically makes Cruz a citizen and eligible for the White House.) Cruz quickly found a place in the American Whig-Cliosophic Society, Princeton's home for debate. A stellar debater, he established himself as the best on campus (and soon, best in the nation, winning one national tournament after another.) He needed a partner for the two-man competitions; he found Panton. The two seemed superficially opposite. Panton had never debated. He wasn't nearly as conservative as Cruz. He spoke with an accent. He was black on a campus where there weren't many black students. \"Ted reached out to me when I was having a hard time,\" Panton says. \"What brought us together was Ted's kindness.\" Cruz and Panton bonded over hearts, spades and video games \u2014 enormous amounts of Super Mario Bros. Cruz tutored Panton on debate and persuaded him on politics. Halfway through freshman year, they swapped roommates; Ted and David would stay together for more than three years at Princeton and then for a year at Harvard Law School. For three years, they would rank first and second nationally in debate. The two were sometimes a world unto themselves. \"For most people, including me, college is a time of developing your views, deciding what your core principles will be,\" Panton says. \"Ted arrived with his principles fully formed. He articulated them so well that that could be intimidating. That rubbed some people the wrong way, without question.\" Cruz had trouble getting his political career going at Princeton. He lost races for class president, student government and, most painfully, president of the debate panel. It wasn't for lack of trying. He created a committee to advocate for better food in dining halls. He offered a course on public speaking, putting ads in the student newspaper: \"Speak well in front of others. Increase your self-confidence. Use the basics of argumentation. All in one semester!\" (Part of his motivation was to pay off an $1,800 poker debt he'd incurred to upperclassmen.) And he led a campaign against the university's proposal to lock the entryway doors on dormitories, arguing that the greater danger on campus came not from unauthorized intruders but from \"date rape, or assaults by other students, which the planned system would do nothing to stop.\" He lost that battle. Panton \u2014 \"the warm, jolly one,\" Lubetzky says, \"while Ted was the uber-serious one\" \u2014 won the campus's top post, president of the student government. Cruz finally won a spot on a joint faculty-student council. In that role, he took on the issue that won him his greatest prominence on campus: He slammed the university's president for running Princeton \"by personal edict.\" (Two decades later, Cruz would accuse President Barack Obama of \"acting as a monarch\" and ruling \"by executive diktat.\") Cruz said Princeton's president, Harold Shapiro, had \"blatantly violated the spirit of the honorary degree process\" when he bypassed the faculty-student council and granted an honorary degree to then-President George H.W. Bush. Similarly, Cruz blasted Shapiro for banning beer kegs from campus events \u2014 again, without consulting the council. Cruz didn't object to Bush getting the degree, just as he didn't care whether campus parties would be allowed to feature kegs of beer. The point in both cases was the principle and the process. \"That's Ted,\" says Lubetzky. \"For Ted, it's all about following the rules. And that's why some people really didn't like him. He was so driven, so serious, always pushing.\" \"That's Ted,\" says Rob Marks, a fellow student who was Cruz's liberal rival on the debate team. \"There was no emotion. It was pure logic. In Ted's mind, he was never wrong. He viewed himself as ideologically pure.\" \"That's Ted,\" says Robert George, a politics professor and prominent conservative theorist who was a mentor and adviser to Cruz. \"He's interested in whether the exercise of authority was legitimate. Questions of how we decide things are not technical. They are moral.\"\n\nEdward Bergman, a New Jersey lawyer who taught Cruz in a course on alternative dispute resolution , says Cruz's classroom manner and written work displayed a smugness that made him unpopular. In the course, Cruz wrote a final paper concluding that alternatives meant to ease the glut of court cases nationwide are \"obstacles to the people's rights\" to trial and due process. \"There he is, in a nutshell,\" Bergman says. \"He was somebody who gave the impression that very complex issues are really not so complex, and he can tell you the superior, correct view. It's a smug, know-it-all attitude about the world.\" It was Cruz's self-certainty, not his ideology, that made him unpopular, says Marks, now a lawyer in Virginia. \"He reasoned through logic, and he could get you to realize what was at the core of your argument, like on abortion, Ted would push you to admit that if you're pro-choice, you think a fetus is not life. He really pounded people on that, and people knew he was brilliant, but it just irked them.\" Marks once watched Cruz get into an argument with a restaurateur at a sub shop in New Haven, Connecticut, where they were in a debate tournament. Cruz and the owner faced off over what was included in the price of a dish. \"It got out of control,\" Marks says. \"Ted just trying to apply rules of logic to a situation where they just didn't apply. The owner asked him to leave.\" - - - When Cruz stood on the Senate floor and railed against Obamacare for 21 hours and 19 minutes, taking time out from his dissection of the health-care law to read Dr. Seuss's \"Green Eggs and Ham\" to his daughters, those who have known him best through the decades saw neither an ideologue nor a bully. They saw in that filibuster in 2013 and in the government shutdown that followed a man simply following his principles. To conclude that Cruz is an extremist or narcissist is the wrong critique, says George, the professor who has remained closest to Cruz: \"The responsible criticism of Ted is to say that statesmanship requires a bending, a flexibility, and to ask if Ted is capable of that.\" The professor was surprised to see Cruz go into politics rather than academia. \"He loves intellectual argument so much,\" George says. \"The very features that caused me to think he was headed for academia are those that make some people find him pedantic.\" Encouraged by a series of like-minded mentors \u2014 his father; George; former federal judge Michael Luttig; Chief Justice William Rehnquist, for whom Cruz clerked; and Chuck Cooper, a Washington lawyer Cruz worked for \u2014 Cruz remained \"a man of very strong beliefs,\" Cooper says, \"unwilling to go along to get along, willing to endure criticism.\" But through those years, Cruz has also changed, friends say. Panton credits Heidi Cruz, a managing director of Goldman Sachs in Houston, with smoothing some of her husband's rough edges. \"He's mellowed greatly, and getting married and having two daughters did that,\" the longtime friend says. Heidi Cruz \u2014 they met working on George W. Bush's 2000 campaign \u2014 says that a decade or two ago, \"people might have found Ted irksome because they couldn't get him off principle. As the years go by and you stay on your principles, you grow into yourself. He's learned not to preach at people. People don't want to be judged.\" Ted Cruz takes pride when the Wall Street Journal refers to him as leader of a \"rump kamikaze caucus\" in the Senate \u2014 the word once used to describe Reagan. He analogizes himself to Uber, as it sweeps aside the dustballs of a taxi industry long buffered from market forces by government regulation. He offers himself as a human disruptive app. In Iowa at the agriculture summit, Cruz moved past the uncomfortable moment about ethanol and fed the audience a heaping plate of rhetorical delights: \"abolish the IRS\"; the EPA is \"completely lawless\"; over the past 17 years, the planet has seen \"no warming whatsoever.\" He wrapped up with the story of a time back home in Texas when a \"6-foot-6 African-American guard walked up to me and said, 'I didn't vote for you, but I'll say this: You've done what you said you'd do.' \" The farmers whose subsidy Cruz would strip away stood to give him the warmest ovation of the day.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Ted Cruz: Principal prodigy or smug unyielding know-it-all?", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "Ted Cruz looked out over a sprawling audience of Iowa farmers and agri-business leaders, people who rely on federal subsidies of ethanol, and the man who would be president stuck it to them.", "title": "Ted Cruz: Principal prodigy or smug unyielding know-it-all?", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/chi-ted-cruz-prodigy-or-know-it-all-20150324-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-551233af/turbine/chi-ted-cruz-prodigy-or-know-it-all-20150324", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp03.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "ted cruz 2016, ted cruz president, ted cruz president announcement, ted cruz run for president", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/83141324", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-03-24", "Description": "Ted Cruz looked out over a sprawling audience of Iowa farmers and agri-business leaders, people who rely on federal subsidies of ethanol, and the man who would be president stuck it to them.   \"I know you'd like me to say I'm for the renewable fuel standard\" \u2014 that's the subsidy of their product...", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "ted cruz 2016, ted cruz president, ted cruz president announcement, ted cruz run for president"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb47d\"", "article_summary": "Some students complained that Ted didn't have an off switch, that he lectured them.\nTed Cruz takes pride when the Wall Street Journal refers to him as leader of a \"rump kamikaze caucus\" in the Senate \u2014 the word once used to describe Reagan.\nEven before high school, Cruz thought about such things.\n\"That's Ted,\" says Robert George, a politics professor and prominent conservative theorist who was a mentor and adviser to Cruz.\nCruz didn't object to Bush getting the degree, just as he didn't care whether campus parties would be allowed to feature kegs of beer."}
