SEIU represents about 1,400 Valley employees.\n\nThe plan will go into effect on Sept. 29 for non-bargaining-unit employees and on Oct. 27 for physicians who are employed by the hospital.\n\nHospital staff has met with hospital employees at several forums to explain the new retirement plan.\n\nValley Medical Center has sent letters to the four unions, asking to begin talks about implementing a new retirement plan, possibly the one now available to non-union members.\n\nBeckley indicated that Valley Medical is not asking that the unions reopen contract negotiations. However, she pointed out that Valley Medical Center has the contractual right to terminate the retirement plans with the unions.\n\n\u201cI would say that it is our goal and our desire for all of our employees to have a top-tier retirement program,\u201d Beckley said.\n\nThe hospital wants to preserve jobs, but at the same time is facing financial challenges, including the cost of health-care reform and absorbing the millions of dollars in costs not covered by insurance, known as uncompensated care.\n\nValley Medical has not updated its retirement plan since 1967.\n\nDiane Sosne, president of SEIU Healthcare 1199NW, said in a statement Wednesday that nurse and health-care workers are proud to work at Valley Medical and provide quality patient care.\n\n\u201cWe are surprised Valley Medical Center would violate labor law to unilaterally implement a change to the pension,\u201d she wrote.\n\nShe suggested that \u201ccollaborating to successfully implement the Affordable Care Act is the best way to meet the healthcare needs of our community.\u201d\n\n\u201cHeavy handed maneuvers are out of character with this employer and we think violating signed contracts with employees is not in the best interest of patients who utilize this hospital,\u201d she wrote.\n\nShe pointed out that the union and Valley Medical have worked in the past to meet challenges, \u201cand we would expect to do so going forward.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Valley Medical Center will change its retirement plan for its employees that it says will save millions of dollars for the hospital hit hard by uncompensated care, a move one union says violates the law.", "og": {"site_name": "Renton Reporter", "description": "Valley Medical Center will change its retirement plan for its employees that it says will save millions of dollars for the hospital hit hard by uncompensated care, a move one union says violates the law.", "title": "Valley Medical plans changes to employee retirement plan - Renton Reporter", "url": "http://www.rentonreporter.com/news/224607961.html", "image": "http://image.issuu.com/160518224721-12e11ccaca0d4fa1983aa4dd91d027f5/jpg/page_1_thumb_large.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"ipad": "Renton Reporter", "iphone": "Renton Reporter", "googleplay": "Renton Reporter"}, "id": {"ipad": 388957262, "iphone": 388957262, "googleplay": "com.doapps.android.mln.MLN_e98741479a7b998f88b8f8c9f0b6b6f1"}}, "site": "@rentonreporter", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 269276063113750}, "msvalidate.01": "87E5B723352F7F19F9D4F82B38A4E2DB", "verify-v1": "xp46D8SohxCVm32IcD0J/9dlxOyum45B4gGBJuzIPBI=", "viewport": "width=1228"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce24c\"", "article_summary": "However, she pointed out that Valley Medical Center has the contractual right to terminate the retirement plans with the unions.\n\u201cWe are surprised Valley Medical Center would violate labor law to unilaterally implement a change to the pension,\u201d she wrote.\nValley Medical has not updated its retirement plan since 1967.\nBut the largest union at Valley Medical, the Service Employees International Union, Healthcare 1199 Northwest, has raised concerns about the retirement plan, maintaining labor law is violated.\nValley Medical Center has sent letters to the four unions, asking to begin talks about implementing a new retirement plan, possibly the one now available to non-union members."}
