Rinovum Women's Health, YouTube/screenshot\n\nThe first at-home artificial insemination device, known as the Stork, is now being made available as an over-the-counter product in the United States. Comparable in effectiveness to more complex IUI (intrauterine insemination) and IVF (in vitro fertilization) procedures, the Stork is the first OTC device sold in the U.S.\n\nFor couples who struggle with reaching conception, alternatives are often few and far between, with cost standing as the tallest hurdle. Data from the National Infertility Association shows one cycle of IUI costs an average of $865, and IVF costs an average of $12,400. While these procedures may have the added benefit of clinical oversight, according to a 1986 study cervical cap insemination already offers a 19 percent boost in fertility rates.\n\nThe Stork relies on a two-part mechanism for delivering sperm to a woman\u2019s uterus. The first is a cervical cap, which collects the man\u2019s sperm during intercourse. The second is the applicator, which delivers the sperm directly to the woman\u2019s cervix, where it stays for up to six hours. The starting retail price for the Stork is $79.99.\n\nParent company Rinovum announced in Aug. 2013 the Stork\u2019s approval in Europe. On Sept. 10, it announced approval in the U.S. and Canada. The device may help the some 15 percent of American couples who fail to conceive after one year of trying.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "stork, home, conception, aid, breaks, ground, first, home, artificial, insemination, device", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "At a retail price of $79.99, the Stork could give couples struggling with infertility a way out from expensive clinical procedures.", "title": "First At-Home Conception Aid, The Stork, Lands In US [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/stork-home-conception-aid-breaks-ground-first-home-artificial-insemination-device-304800", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/24/stork.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "At a retail price of $79.99, the Stork could give couples struggling with infertility a way out from expensive clinical procedures.", "title": "First At-Home Conception Aid, The Stork, Lands In US [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/stork-home-conception-aid-breaks-ground-first-home-artificial-insemination-device-304800", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/24/stork.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/24/stork.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-09-24T16:27:38-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-24T16:27:38-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "At a retail price of $79.99, the Stork could give couples struggling with infertility a way out from expensive clinical procedures."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd46aa\"", "article_summary": "Rinovum Women's Health, YouTube/screenshotThe first at-home artificial insemination device, known as the Stork, is now being made available as an over-the-counter product in the United States.\nAt a retail price of $79.99, the Stork could give couples struggling with infertility a way out from expensive clinical procedures.\nThe starting retail price for the Stork is $79.99.\nThe device may help the some 15 percent of American couples who fail to conceive after one year of trying.\nThe Stork relies on a two-part mechanism for delivering sperm to a woman\u2019s uterus."}
