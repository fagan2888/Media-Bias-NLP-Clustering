And this is the reason why a bunch of male grooming products have sprung up in the last few years.\n\nThe male grooming segment which was projected to be Rs 1,500 crore market in 2012 is expected to reach Rs 5,300 crore by 2016.\n\nAccording to a Nielsen study on the Indian male grooming segment, there is a rising aspiration among Indian men to look groomed, which has led to the Indian men\u2019s grooming market\u2019s rapid growth of more than 34 per cent.\n\nThe Nielsen study further stated that this growth is faster than the growth rate of the total personal care and beauty industry in India. The research company believes time is ripe for beauty and grooming brands to make the most of this growing male attention.\n\nThe segment can be divided into sub categories: beauty range of products and grooming gadgets (manual and electronic).\n\nAs per a report by Euromonitor International on male grooming sector in India, Gillette India lead men\u2019s grooming with a value share of 28 per cent in 2012. The company has a strong horizontally diversified portfolio of razors and blades, with brands such as Mach, Vector, 7\u2019O clock and many more, enhancing its long term sustainability. Hindustan Unilever was second, accounting for a 15 per cent share. These products fall in to the manual sub category.\n\nOn the other hand, in the electronic sub-category, Philips with a range of grooming gadgets for men including trimmers, shavers and stylers, is ruling the market share, claims the company.\n\nTo take a step further, the brand is set to roll out an extensive marketing campaign.\n\nThe brand has decided to add celebrity quotient to its communication and has roped in actor Arjun Kapoor to be its face in the country. It can be noted that earlier John Abraham was its brand ambassador.\n\nThe TVC which went on air on 10 July has been conceptualised and created by Ogilvy & Mather. The brand will also splash its communication on other media platforms. About 15-20 per cent of its marketing budget is expected to be invested on digital.\n\nThe business of electronic brands of this segment is growing at 30-40 per cent year on year, mentions Philips India director marketing-personal care Anurita Chopra.\n\n\u201cThe Indian market is fast adopting this particular category. The reason to bring Arjun on board is mainly because he brings in positivity which we as a brand are trying to promote through our communication,\u201d says Philips India president consumer lifestyle ADA Ratnam.\n\nHowever, the pricing strategy of the brand is to make it affordable.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "General", "googlebot": "index,follow", "generator": "Indiantelevision.com (http://indiantelevision.com)", "og": {"url": "http://www.indiantelevision.com/mam/marketing/brands/philips-india-adds-celebrity-quotient-to-its-male-grooming-category-140712", "image": "http://www.indiantelevision.com/sites/drupal7.indiantelevision.co.in/files/images/mam-images/2014/07/12/philips.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Television Dot Com", "title": "Philips India adds celebrity quotient to its male grooming category"}, "description": "The brand has roped in Arjun Kapoor for its 360 degree marketing campaign. \n  | Philips India adds celebrity quotient to its male grooming category  | Indian Television Dot Com", "alexaVerifyID": "RwvUTeli_Kiu-z9rOgG8pY0DNn8", "ROBOTS": "ALL", "date": "2014-07-12", "fb": {"app_id": 182882285236404}, "PRAGMA": "NO-STORE", "keywords": "Nielsen, Ogilvy & Mather, Gillette India, HUL, ADA Ratnam, Philips India, Arjun Kapoor, john Abraham, Anurita ChopraNielsen, Ogilvy & Mather, Gillette India, HUL, ADA Ratnam, Philips India, Arjun Kapoor, john Abraham, Anurita ChopraOgilvy & Mather", "verify-v1": "0ip9AwQSaYkyPpXwUPRRVHdsvrId4WdKCQefhrpor+c=", "news_keywords": "Nielsen, Ogilvy & Mather, Gillette India, HUL, ADA Ratnam, Philips India, Arjun Kapoor, john Abraham, Anurita ChopraOgilvy & Mather"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd01bf\"", "article_summary": "And this is the reason why a bunch of male grooming products have sprung up in the last few years.\nThe male grooming segment which was projected to be Rs 1,500 crore market in 2012 is expected to reach Rs 5,300 crore by 2016.\nAs per a report by Euromonitor International on male grooming sector in India, Gillette India lead men\u2019s grooming with a value share of 28 per cent in 2012.\nAccording to a Nielsen study on the Indian male grooming segment, there is a rising aspiration among Indian men to look groomed, which has led to the Indian men\u2019s grooming market\u2019s rapid growth of more than 34 per cent.\nThe business of electronic brands of this segment is growing at 30-40 per cent year on year, mentions Philips India director marketing-personal care Anurita Chopra."}
