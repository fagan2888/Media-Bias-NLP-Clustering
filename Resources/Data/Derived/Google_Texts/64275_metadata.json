As always, you can blame the economy.\n\nOne facet of Obamacare is that it expanded Medicaid eligibility. The CBO now expects a bump in Medicaid sign-ups \u2014 up to 11 million enrolled this year and 15 million by 2026, per the report \u2014 citing new economic projections and \u201ca decrease in the share of future wage growth projected to go to lower-income people.\u201d\n\nIn other words: future economic growth isn\u2019t expected to benefit poor people, which will accelerate the ACA\u2019s overall costs.\n\nYet these increases aside, Obamacare is overall still costing less than was first expected years ago: $157 billion less, or 25%, the CBO report said.\n\nRead more: Will hiking average Obamacare tax penalty to $969 boost enrollment?\n\nProjections have a tendency to change, especially with this sprawling a piece of legislation, said Cynthia Cox, an associate director at Kaiser, but she noted that the new numbers were framed \u201cin terms of economic outlook and wage growth\u201d even as enrollment projections have declined.\n\nSee more: This is the fate of Obamacare under the next president\n\nThe CBO is now expecting enrollment to max out at 19 million in 2019.\n\nSome experts think even that\u2019s a little high. The Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s analysis suggests that enrollment would be, at most, 15 or 16 million, and that\u2019s only if all state enrollment rates matched those of the top 10 states now.\n\nKaiser\u2019s Cox noted that there could be some uptick in the enrollment rates in the next or following years, since a phased-in penalty on being uninsured reached its cap this year. (Households will pay $969 on average for remaining uninsured in 2016, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis.)\n\nBut that cost could take some time to change the behavior of consumers, since they\u2019ll only pay the penalty the following year, alongside their taxes, she said.\n\nSee: 7 Obamacare failures that have hurt Americans\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "New Obamacare enrollment numbers are lower than previous estimates, while costs are higher.", "creator": "@emmarcourt", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CT400_afford_ZG_20140904110821.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Emma Court", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Economy & Politics", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "New Obamacare enrollment numbers are lower than previous estimates, while costs are higher.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/whats-behind-shrinking-obamacare-projections-its-the-economy-stupid-2016-03-25", "author": "Emma Court", "parsely-title": "Why will Obamacare cost more?
