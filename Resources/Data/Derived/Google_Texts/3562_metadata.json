But Gov. Paul LePage insisted he was being unfairly pilloried for \u2018one slip-up.\u2019\u201d\n\nWall Street : \u201cU.S. stocks ended one of their worst opening weeks in history with another sharp decline on Friday, as concerns about sagging energy prices overwhelmed early optimism about stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs numbers and a stabilization of Chinese markets.\u201d\n\nQuakes : \u201cOklahoma was rocked Wednesday night by two of the state\u2019s largest earthquakes in recent years, further fueling scientists\u2019 concern that the continued burial of oil and gas wastes in seismically active areas was courting a much more powerful earthquake.\u201d\n\n* Wages: \u201cJust before the new year began, Doug Short posted his monthly take on both nominal and inflation-adjusted median household income. The November number is the best since the Great Recession began but still falls short of where it was in January 2008 and the peak in January 2002.\u201d\n\n* It\u2019s worth keeping an eye on this : \u201cSome Democrats are signaling they may be ready to work on a compromise with Republicans on legislation authorizing the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\u201d\n\n* One of the week\u2019s unintentionally funny stories: \u201cLobbyists who have sex with a Missouri lawmaker or a member of a lawmaker\u2019s staff would have to disclose it to the Missouri Ethics Commission under a bill introduced Wednesday in the Missouri House. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Bart Korman, a Montgomery County Republican, defines sex between lobbyists and legislators as a gift. As such, sexual relations would have to be included on monthly lobbyist gift disclosure forms.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Today's edition of quick hits.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/fridays-mini-report-1816", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Today's edition of quick hits.", "title": "Friday's Mini-Report, 1.8.16", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/fridays-mini-report-1816", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/maddow_theminireport_general.png?itok=yLUr4wsw", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "title": "Friday's Mini-Report, 1.8.16", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/fridays-mini-report-1816", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/maddow_theminireport_general.png?itok=HBMEr8oq", "height": 553}, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Today's edition of quick hits."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2016-01-08T17:30:23-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "Today's edition of quick hits.", "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "Friday's Mini-Report, 1.8.16", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/fridays-mini-report-1816", "published": 1, "date": "01/08/2016 17:30:23 EST", "tags": "rachel-maddow-show"}}, "article_summary": "The bill, sponsored by Rep.
