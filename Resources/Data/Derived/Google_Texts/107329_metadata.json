What if the military only covered active members and not family members and retirees? That\u2019s an idea some analysts floated at an event held by the Brookings Institution last month. Such people could get health plans through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges, and the military\u2019s overall health spending would decrease, the analysts suggested.\n\nMost Brookings event participants agreed on one key point: The military has the responsibility to provide health care coverage to active service members and their families in order to maintain recruitment and retention.\n\nHowever, they differed on whether the military should still be responsible for such coverage once service members retire and have access to health coverage elsewhere \u2014 such as through employers or the ACA.\n\nIn a keynote speech at the Brookings event, Jonathan Woodson, assistant secretary of defense for health affairs at the Department of Defense, said that the \u201cmilitary health system is in a transformative period after 13 plus years of war. We have performed well, but we need to position ourselves to be stronger, better and more relevant to the future.\u201d\n\nThe Military Health System \u2014 and the Need for Reform\n\nWhile the military has made some \u201csignificant changes\u201d to slow health care spending growth, the \u201cbudget restraint will continue. More needs to be done,\u201d Robert Hale, former undersecretary of defense at DOD, argued during the event.\n\nThe military health system provides health care for 9.6 million active duty and retired military members, including 1.3 million active-duty service members.\n\nWoodson noted that the system includes:\n\n54 hospitals;\n\nMore than 350 medical clinics; and\n\n380,000 providers.\n\nSince 2000, the military health budget has increased by 130%, reaching $52 billion. That increase, according to a Congressional Budget Office report, is largely attributable to expanded benefits over the past decade.\n\nDuring the Brookings event, Carla Tighe Murray, a senior analyst at CBO, said that 2.1 million individuals enrolled in one such new program, Tricare For Life, which provides care for military retirees who are eligible for Medicare and their families. She noted that the program \u201cessentially reduces the out-of-pocket costs for military retirees and their families, almost to zero,\u201d adding, \u201cBasically, Medicare pays, then Medicare Part B pays, and then Tricare pays the remainder of those costs.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, active-duty service members\u2019 families who are enrolled in the military\u2019s HMO program \u2014 called Tricare Prime \u2014 do not pay annual fees or contribute any cost-sharing to visit a doctor. Military retirees pay about $555 annually for Tricare Prime coverage for themselves and their families, plus fees ranging from $12 to 20% of the cost of care.\n\nMurray said out-of-pocket costs through Tricare are \u201csignificantly below what other options are \u2026 for civilians, either through the private insurance market or through employment-based insurance.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you see more people joining and those people who join tend to use the system more,\u201d which contributes to the overall spending rate, Murray said. She added that \u201c[t]hose who are in Tricare tend to use about 50% more health care services than people using civilian HMO plans of comparable age.\u201d\n\nRising Costs Bolster Argument for Shifting Military Families, Retirees to the Exchanges \u2026\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little radical, but should we be thinking about how some of the military system might transition some of their people to the [ACA] exchanges, especially in sparsely populated areas of the country?\u201d Alice Rivlin \u2014 a senior fellow in economic studies at Brookings and former director of both the CBO and Office of Management and Budget \u2014 asked during the Brookings event.\n\nThe \u201ccase for the special supply of [health] services is strong for the active duty\u201d but is \u201cmuch weaker\u201d for their families, Henry Aaron \u2014 a senior fellow at Brookings and past assistant secretary for planning and evaluation at the former Department of Health, Education and Welfare \u2014 argued. \u201cThat suggests the possible appeal of the option [Rivlin] mentioned, which is to help them have fair, well-financed access to the general health care system.\u201d\n\nJohn Mayer, a military health and energy analyst at Booz Allen Hamilton, seemed to concur, arguing that having a program that allows military retirees to \u201cgo in and get free health care, and do it as often as they want seems to be a burden that the American public shouldn\u2019t have to bear.\u201d\n\n\u2026 But Is the Idea Realistic?\n\nObservers say that moving family members and military retirees out of the health system would not necessarily be an idea openly embraced by lawmakers and stakeholders.\n\nFollowing the Brookings event, retired Navy Captain Kathy Beasley, with the Military Officers Association of America, said, \u201cI think there were some excellent people on this panel \u2026 with some nuggets to think about, especially when it comes to working on things together, between the military health system and the civilian health system.\u201d However, Beasley added, \u201cBut some of this stuff \u2026 I just think some of them really don\u2019t understand the military health system.\u201d\n\nIn February, the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission \u2014 an independent panel tasked by Congress with reviewing military pay and benefits \u2014 is expected to issue a report that will review military health care coverage, as well as other military benefits.\n\nThe report likely will shine some light on how serious of a problem growing health care costs is for the military \u2014 and it could give more weight to the argument for switching military retirees and depends to the exchanges.\n\nAround the Nation\n\nSaying \u2018no\u2019 to free money. In a recent U.S. News & World Report article, Kimberly Leonard writes that some consumers are refusing to accept federal subsidies as a way of protesting the ACA.\n\nBenefits groups call for delay. According to Business Insurance, an employer benefits lobbying group is calling on the Department of Treasury to delay an ACA requirement that businesses provide health coverage to 95% of their full-time employees.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some experts have said that military dependents and retirees should be moved out of Tricare coverage and into health plans sold through the Affordable Care Act's exchanges.
