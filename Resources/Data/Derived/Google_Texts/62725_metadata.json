Elm St. in Springfield. State Senator Jay Wasson and Representative Eric Burlison (center) were in attendance. (Photo: Submitted Photo)\n\nFour area CVS/pharmacy stores will have walk-in retail medical clinics inside by the end of this year.\n\nMinuteClinic, a division of Rhode Island-based CVS Health, formally entered the Springfield market Oct. 21, with an opening inside the CVS at 2715 E. Battlefield Road. A second location opened at 1153 E. Elm St. on Oct. 28; a ribbon-cutting ceremony was held there Tuesday morning to mark the expansion.\n\nA third MinuteClinic location at 3045 W. Republic Road is slated to open Nov. 18, followed by 1220 E. Republic Road in December.\n\nMinuteClinic locations are open seven days a week, with no appointment necessary. They are staffed by nurse practitioners, who can diagnose and write prescriptions for common illnesses like strep throat and sinus infections, as well as treat minor wounds and administer common vaccines. CVS pitches the clinics as a complement to a health system where primary care physicians are in high demand.\n\n\"About 50 percent of MinuteClinic visits occur on evenings, weekends and holidays when patients may not be able to get an appointment with their primary care provider, and about half of the patients seen at MinuteClinic are 'medically homeless' and do not have a personal physician,\" MinuteClinic president Dr. Andrew Sussman said in a news release.\n\nMinuteClinic accepts most major health insurance, including several Medicaid plans in Missouri. For patients paying cash or credit, treatment prices are posted at each clinic and at www.minuteclinic.com. The cost for most services starts at $79 - $99.\n\n\u201cTargeted expansion into markets like Springfield brings high-quality, convenient and affordable health care services to community members,\u201d MinuteClinic president Dr. Andrew Sussman said in a news release. \u201cWe face a significant shortage in primary care providers, an aging Baby Boomer population and the addition of millions of newly insured patients through the Affordable Care Act. By increasing access to care, MinuteClinic can help support the primary care medical home in Missouri.\u201d\n\nWithin Missouri, MinuteClinic \u2014 which has more than 1,000 locations across 33 states \u2014 has been in the Kansas City market since 2006, and the St. Louis market since last year.\n\nOther walk-in clinics in the Springfield area include The Clinic at Walmart locations, which are operated by CoxHealth.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://sgfnow.co/1iSl6NY", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Four area CVS/pharmacy stores will have walk-in retail medical clinics inside by the end of this year", "og": {"site_name": "Springfield News-Leader", "description": "Four area CVS/pharmacy stores will have walk-in retail medical clinics inside by the end of this year", "title": "Walk-in medical clinics opening in area CVS stores", "url": "http://www.news-leader.com/story/news/business/2015/11/10/walk--medical-clinics-opening-area-cvs-stores/75471864/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/news-leader.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Four area CVS/pharmacy stores will have walk-in retail medical clinics inside by the end of this year", "title": "Walk-in medical clinics opening in area CVS stores", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f938c1bec7cba4cf55a63cfedb5b86fd6daf6111/c=564-0-3474-2910&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/11/10/Springfield/Springfield/635827620429642590-CVS-SGF-94014.jpg", "creator": "@springfieldNL", "site": "@springfieldNL", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=805766992", "fb": {"app_id": 164654783578465}, "article": {"author": "facebook.com/tgounley"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "(Photo: Submitted Photo)Four area CVS/pharmacy stores will have walk-in retail medical clinics inside by the end of this year.\nCVS pitches the clinics as a complement to a health system where primary care physicians are in high demand.\nMinuteClinic, a division of Rhode Island-based CVS Health, formally entered the Springfield market Oct. 21, with an opening inside the CVS at 2715 E.
