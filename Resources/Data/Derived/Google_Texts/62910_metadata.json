The appropriate intervention gone badly, the symptom after consideration mistakenly reassured. \u2026 I can tell you, it cuts like a knife. You face the family and fight back the tears. You wake up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat and wish you had that moment back.\n\nAnd sometimes one night leads to a dozen. My wife will tell you, it\u2019s a load to carry.\n\nGov. McCrory and Sen. Berger, you now carry that same weight, whether you will admit it or not. Welcome to this our unfortunate fraternity: those who carry the blood of others on our hands. Like it or not, we are all three members.\n\nSome in Rockingham County will surely die \u2014 if some haven\u2019t already \u2014 because of your partisan decision to reject Medicaid expansion.\n\nPlease embrace our shared humanity. The two of you have the power to get this done.\n\nRe-approach this issue with an open mind and you will experience a change of heart.\n\nUntil then, I hope you\u2019ll wake up some nights in a cold sweat, knowing you have committed a terrible wrong. Shame on you for your complicity thus far in denying basic health insurance to the most vulnerable residents of our state.\n\nShame on the rest of us for letting you get away with it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Until then, I hope you\u2019ll wake up some nights in a cold sweat, knowing you have committed a terrible wrong.\nYou wake up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat and wish you had that moment back.\nAnd sometimes one night leads to a dozen.\nSome in Rockingham County will surely die \u2014 if some haven\u2019t already \u2014 because of your partisan decision to reject Medicaid expansion.\nShame on you for your complicity thus far in denying basic health insurance to the most vulnerable residents of our state."}
