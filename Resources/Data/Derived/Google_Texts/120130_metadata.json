People on all sides of the political spectrum are starting to talk about a third class of worker: the dependent contractor, which would recognize the flexibility of workers but also build in some of the protections that full employees get.\n\nAnd an overhaul like this would need to be taken on by Congress, according to US Sen. Mark Warner (D-Virginia). Warner, an early player in the mobile-phone business who has spent more time as a venture capitalist than as a politician, talked about these issues Thursday in an interview with Business Insider.\n\n\"I don't have a full-fledged proposal at this point, but the old 20th-century model doesn't work,\" he said. \"That's yesterday's thinking \u2014 there are a whole series of people who don't fit neatly into those categories.\"\n\nThe problem, he said, is to figure out how to deal with this new sector of the economy, which is growing rapidly, but not \"squash the innovation\" going on in Silicon Valley. This is a thorny issue for politicians and regulators. On the one hand, you want to protect workers, but on the other, you don't want to over-regulate a fledgling industry before it has time to develop.\n\nWarner thinks it is time, though, not least because people have started suing to get answers. This is where Congress needs to step in to clarify matters, he says. \"These platforms that connect people, they don't want to have 50 different answers coming from 50 different litigations.\"\n\nHis ideas seems to center on public-private partnerships such as the Affordable Care Act's healthcare exchanges in which outside companies offer insurance for things including workers' compensation and disability insurance, and each worker is free to pick an option. He also likes the idea of an hour bank, in which a person qualifies for insurance based on how many hours he or she works each month, as recorded by a third party.\n\nWhat about universal basic income? That idea \u2014 that every adult should be given a small amount of money so their basic needs are met and they can focus their working hours on what they really want to do \u2014 has proponents on both the libertarian right and the socialist left. Albert Wenger, a partner at the venture-capital firm Union Square Ventures, floated this idea as a solution in a blog post earlier this week.\n\nWarner said he knew about this argument. \"I don't think that's where our political system is moving the short-term,\" he said. \"I'm not ruling that out, but that's not where I think this debate is going to start.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Shane Ferro", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "A battle is brewing for the American worker.
