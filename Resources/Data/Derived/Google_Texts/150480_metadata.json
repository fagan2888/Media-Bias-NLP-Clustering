You don\u2019t get a chance to call your bank and say I\u2019m not going to pay my mortgage this month unless you throw in a new car and an Xbox.\u201d\n\nObama also pointed out that the shutdown had occurred as a result of Republicans\u2019 strong opposition to the health care law he passed. \u201cThe way we got to this point was one thing and one thing only: this Republican obsession with dismantling the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he said. \u201cMost Americans \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 agree that health care should not have anything to do with keeping our government open or paying our bills on time.\u201d\n\nAt one point, Obama looked directly into the camera and apologized to the American people for the continuing cycle of partisan brinksmanship over budget and deficit issues.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop repeating this pattern. I know the American people are tired of it,\u201d the president said, adding: \u201cI apologize you have to go through this stuff every three months, it seems like. And Lord knows, I\u2019m tired of it. At some point we\u2019ve got to break these habits.\u201d\n\nWatch below.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "EURweb", "description": "*After speaking with House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) by phone earlier today, President Barack Obama repeated his position that he wanted the House to pass a clean continuing resolution to fund the government and a debt limit hike before negotiating over the deficit.
