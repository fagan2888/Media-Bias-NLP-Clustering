This month has been anything but winter across southern Arizona. Our streak of hot February weather will continue into this upcoming work week, when five out of seven days could possibly reach new record-high temperatures.

Last week we broke or tied three record highs. During an El Niño year it is hard to break record highs. This year, Mother Nature does not seem to care, with the warmest temperatures since October on the horizon.

Date Forecast High Record High Monday 2/15 83° 88° Tuesday 2/16 86° 85° Wednesday 2/17 87° 86° Thursday 2/18 84° 85° Friday 2/19 83° 85° Saturday 2/20 82° 89° Sunday 2/21 83° 82°
