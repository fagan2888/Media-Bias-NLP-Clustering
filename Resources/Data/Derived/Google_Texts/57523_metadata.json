Cresent Hardy credit for one thing: He didn\u2019t back away from his controversial positions on some of the issues despite facing a somewhat hostile crowd at the monthly Hispanics in Politics breakfast meeting Wednesday.\n\nBut on the most controversial issue of interest to the group \u2014 immigration reform \u2014 the Mesquite Republican didn\u2019t offer many of his own views, although he did predict some bill would emerge from the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no easy solution to immigration,\u201d Hardy said, calling for a \u201csmart, compassionate, thoughtful process.\u201d But what would that process entail? And what would a final bill look like? And would Hardy, like Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton, favor a bill that offers immigrants a pathway to citizenship? Hardy left those questions unanswered.\n\nBack in 2014, Hardy told the Review-Journal\u2019s editorial board that he thought children brought here illegally by their parents should get a chance to stay in the country and eventually become citizens, although those parents should only be allowed to achieve \u201clegal status,\u201d and not necessarily citizenship. Curiously, however, he also said in that interview he would have voted against the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which offers young people a reprieve from deportation.\n\nHardy noted on Wednesday that President Barack Obama\u2019s executive orders on immigration are temporary, and could be reversed at the whim of a future president. \u201cThey cause uncertainty,\u201d Hardy said of the president\u2019s orders.\n\nIn response to a question from an audience member, however, Hardy acknowledged that the Republican Party is divided on the issue of immigration reform, which accounts for the fact that the House has failed to take up even GOP-generated legislation to address the issue. He predicted that attempts at legislation would begin with border security, but warned that the push to resolve the problem can\u2019t stop there.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t solve it, we\u2019ll pay for it,\u201d Hardy said.\n\nBut critics say the border-security-first approach is a chimera, since standards for what constitutes a fully secured border can shift. In the meantime, the country must deal with a sizable population of immigrants already here with murky, semi-legal status. A bipartisan bill passed by the Senate in 2014 to address the matter has been ignored in the House.\n\nOn other issues, Hardy had little trouble standing up for his views opposing the Affordable Care Act and the concept of the minimum wage, although it appeared many in the audience supported both. He said minimum wages have only come to the fore because of the lack of good jobs, and that once the economy started moving again, more people would find employment at higher wages.\n\nPlus, he said, imposing minimum wages would increase mechanization of jobs, which would lead to more unemployment. (Don\u2019t laugh: McDonald\u2019s is experimenting with kiosks that take orders in lieu of humans. And there are driverless trucks now, too.)\n\nHardy, who has declared his support for totally repealing Obama\u2019s health-care reform, also repeated his support for that idea.\n\nAnd Hardy endorsed the idea of placing more federally owned public lands in the hands of the state of Nevada. He scoffed at the notion of federal protection of public land, and even hinted that vandalism on public lands is being perpetrated by people who support designating those areas as protected wilderness.\n\nOh, and on his most recent push to draw attention to Yucca Mountain, Hardy said again he\u2019s neither for nor against the proposed nuclear waste repository, but merely wants to \u201chave a conversation\u201d about it. (That conversation is opposed by most other members of Nevada\u2019s congressional delegation.) He said that once people across the country realize that waste will have to be trucked through their communities, Nevada might pick up more opposition from those living on transport routes.\n\nHardy defeated Rep. Steven Horsford in 2014 in an unexpected victory, and is being targeted by Democrats in 2016 as a vulnerable incumbent. Thus far, state Sen. Ruben Kihuen, D-Las Vegas, and former Assemblywoman Lucy Flores have declared their intent to seek the seat, but others may enter the race as well, including former Assembly Speaker John Oceguera or state Sens. Kelvin Atkinson, D-Las Vegas or Pat Spearman, D-North Las Vegas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
