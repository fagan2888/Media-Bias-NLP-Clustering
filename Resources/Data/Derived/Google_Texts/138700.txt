Two pedestrians were struck and killed by cars in Rowlett this weekend.

Police say the crashes, which occurred near different parts of Lake Ray Hubbard, are unrelated.

Late Friday, a woman was struck by a car around 10 p.m. near The Ramblin’ Rose, a bar located at 3594 Elm Grove Road. She was identified by police as Michelle Bryce of Rowlett. Bryce, 55, was taken to Lake Pointe Medical Center and flown to Parkland Memorial Hospital, where she died from injuries.

Bryce’s husband was at the scene of the crash. He told police that he and his wife had left The Ramblin’ Rose and were walking with friends to a nearby home. He said his wife was on the shoulder of the road when she was struck. There are no sidewalks in the area.

No charges have been filed in the case. Police say the driver remained at the scene and cooperated with officers. They did not release his or her name.

In the second pedestrian crash, a man was struck early Sunday near Lake Ray Hubbard. The man, Edward Joel Gonzalez of Rowlett, was hit by a car around 2:48 a.m. on Miller Road near C.A. Roan Drive. Gonzalez, 22, was taken to Lake Pointe Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.

The driver, whose name has not been released, told police that Gonzalez was walking on the road and was not visible in the darkness. The driver stayed at the scene and did not show signs of intoxication or impairment, police say.

The crash occurred at a narrow, two-lane stretch of Miller Road near Lake Ray Hubbard. Police say the road was wet from light misting at the time of the accident. No charges have been filed in the case.
