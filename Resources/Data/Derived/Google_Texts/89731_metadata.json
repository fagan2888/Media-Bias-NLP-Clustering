Associated Press\n\nThe coming tax-filing season could be the most complicated ever for the Internal Revenue Service, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said in an interview with the nonprofit publisher Tax Analysts that was published this week.\n\nCongress has yet to reinstate dozens of tax provisions that expired at the beginning of 2014, he noted. In past years, late action by Congress on such provisions created problems for the IRS and sometimes delays that affected taxpayers. Moreover, \u201cthe difference this year compared to the past is we are having to implement the Affordable Care Act and Fatca,\u201d he said. Fatca is the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, passed in 2010, which aims to curb offshore-account abuses; its major provisions took effect this year.\n\nEarlier this month, the IRS chief sent a letter to Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) warning of filing-season disruptions if lawmakers delay action too long.\n\nIn the letter, Mr. Koskinen said the uncertainty over the expired provisions, \u201cif it persists into December or later, could force the IRS to postpone the opening of the 2015 filing season and delay the processing of tax refunds for millions of taxpayers.\u201d\n\nWorst of all, the commissioner wrote, would be for Congress to wait until 2015 to enact changes retroactive to January 2014. Such a delay could cause \u201cservice disruptions, millions of taxpayers needing to file amended returns, and substantially delayed refunds,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a statement about the letter, Sen. Wyden agreed with Mr. Koskinen that Congress should move decisively to restore the provisions. However, Congress is not expected to address the extenders until after the election next month.\n\nThe provisions important to individuals that expired at the beginning of this year include a deduction for state and local sales taxes; a tax exemption for the forgiveness of mortgage debt; a tuition deduction; an enhanced break for transit commuters; and\u2014especially\u2014the individual retirement account charitable rollover, which allows people 70 l/2 and older to make tax-free donations of IRA assets to charity.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Delayed action by Congress on expired provisions could disrupt the tax-filing season, John  Koskinen says", "title": "IRS Chief Warns of Possible Tax-Refund Delays", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/totalreturn/2014/10/23/irs-chief-warns-of-possible-tax-refund-delays/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FD590_1023Ko_P_20141022160625.jpg"}, "site": "WSJpersfinance", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Personal Finance", "article.headline": "IRS Chief Warns of Possible Tax-Refund Delays", "description": "Delayed action by Congress on expired provisions could disrupt the tax-filing season, John  Koskinen says", "article_section": "Personal Finance", "author": "Laura Saunders", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Total Return Blog", "page.subsection": "Total Return", "article.summary": "Delayed action by Congress on expired provisions could disrupt the tax-filing season, John  Koskinen says", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-10-23T11:00:58-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/totalreturn/2014/10/23/irs-chief-warns-of-possible-tax-refund-delays/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-TOTALB-2381", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Personal Finance", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Delayed action by Congress on expired provisions could disrupt the tax-filing season, John  Koskinen says", "title": "IRS Chief Warns of Possible Tax-Refund Delays", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/totalreturn/2014/10/23/irs-chief-warns-of-possible-tax-refund-delays/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FD590_1023Ko_P_20141022160625.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Total Return", "article.id": "BL-TOTALB-2381", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-10-23T12:29:43-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd07b2\"", "article_summary": "IRS Commissioner John Koskinen testifies before Congress in July.\nIn past years, late action by Congress on such provisions created problems for the IRS and sometimes delays that affected taxpayers.\nCongress has yet to reinstate dozens of tax provisions that expired at the beginning of 2014, he noted.\nIn a statement about the letter, Sen.
