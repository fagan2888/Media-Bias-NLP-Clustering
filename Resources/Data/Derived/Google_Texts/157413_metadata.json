The federal government would provide about 75 percent of the costs, and states would have to commit to cover the rest. The states also would have to show that they are working to improve the quality of that education.\n\nObama is expected to release an estimate of those costs later this month. The Washington Post quoted an administration official as estimating the cost at about $60 billion over 10 years.\n\nColorado Lt. Gov. Joe Garcia, also the executive director of the state\u2019s Department of Higher Education, said Friday the plan would support the state\u2019s goals of increasing the number of adults with higher education.\n\n\u201cPeople often say you don\u2019t need to go to college to get a job. That was true when I graduated. It\u2019s less true now,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cI hope this would get more individuals \u2014 not just 18-year-olds, but 38-year-olds \u2014 to go to a community college.\u201d\n\nOfficials cited a report from Georgetown University that estimates almost 74 percent of jobs in Colorado by 2020 will require more than a high school education.\n\nState Sen. Kent Lambert, R-Colorado Springs, opposes Obama\u2019s plan because of the federal involvement and a lack of student investment and says the need for higher education in today\u2019s workforce might actually be reflecting a failure of the K-12 system.\n\n\u201cThe federal government should be getting out of the education role. It is unfortunate that we have to get a lot of our job training out of community colleges,\u201d Lambert said. \u201cBut why are we delaying that education until students are 18 to 20 years old? They should be getting that education when they\u2019re in high school.\u201d\n\nLambert said he is supportive of dual enrollment programs in Colorado that already allow high school students to earn free college credit \u2014 often an associate\u2019s degree worth \u2014 while in high school.\n\nEnrollment in those programs has been increasing.\n\nAccording to the Department of Higher Education, there were 26,935 Colorado high school students taking college classes in the 2012-13 school year, which is up from 20,786 in 2010-11.\n\nNancy McCallin, president of the Community College System, said the Obama plan would provide an opportunity for more people \u2014 and one that wouldn\u2019t be possible otherwise.\n\n\u201cWe have to be realistic,\u201d McCallin said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way the state could afford to do this on its own.\u201d\n\nU.S. Sen. Michael Bennet was not available for comment, but the Democrat released a statement saying the plan aligns to the mission of a bill he is sponsoring that would make it easier for college students to apply for financial aid.\n\n\u201cAt a time when other countries are graduating more students from college, we should be focusing our efforts on ensuring that any student that wants to go to college can,\u201d Bennet said.\n\nGarcia said that it\u2019s likely, even under the proposed plan, that Colorado would need to partner with private businesses to raise the necessary matching funds.\n\nMark Ferrandino, chief financial officer for Denver Public Schools and former state House representative, said if the plan moves forward at the federal level, it would \u201cbe silly not to figure out how to raise that money here.\u201d\n\nMcCallin said the biggest question remains.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama views this as a game-changer, and I would absolutely agree,\u201dMcCallin said. But she added, \u201cGiven the climate in D.C., does anything really have the ability to pass? That is a fundamental question.\u201d\n\nYesenia Robles: 303-954-1372, yrobles@denverpost.com or twitter.com/yeseniarobles", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado officials react to President Obama\u2019s community college plan", "title": "Colorado officials react to President Obama\u2019s community college plan", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/09/colorado-officials-react-to-president-obamas-community-college-plan/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150109__20120327_hispanicCapitol05p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150109__20120327_hispanicCapitol05p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-09T15:59:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T05:11:21+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Election 2012, higher education"}, "article_summary": "Colorado officials are divided on their opinions about President Barack Obama\u2019s plan to make two years of education at community colleges free.\nNancy McCallin, president of the Community College System, said the Obama plan would provide an opportunity for more people \u2014 and one that wouldn\u2019t be possible otherwise.\nAccording to the Department of Higher Education, there were 26,935 Colorado high school students taking college classes in the 2012-13 school year, which is up from 20,786 in 2010-11.\nThe plan would allow any student to go to community college without paying, so long as they maintain at least a 2.5 grade-point average and stay on track to graduate.\nJoe Garcia, also the executive director of the state\u2019s Department of Higher Education, said Friday the plan would support the state\u2019s goals of increasing the number of adults with higher education."}
