But President Obama has yet to accept a resignation.\n\nThe Maryland exchange\u2019s board of directors released a statement saying it has accepted Pearce\u2019s resignation and that she \u201cworked tirelessly and with tremendous dedication to build Maryland Health Connection over more than two years.\u201d\n\nThe group has not said exactly why Pearce resigned. But a source told The Washington Post is was related to leadership changes made by Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, a strong political ally of Obama and a potential 2016 Democratic presidential candidate.\n\nMaryland is one of 14 states running its own exchange and has struggled with the same kind of technical problems that have plagued the federal site that the 36 other states use to sign up Americans for insurance under Obama\u2019s signature health care reform law.\n\nO\u2019Malley has been a strong supporter of ObamaCare, and his Democratic-leaning state was among the first to get started on a state-run exchange.\n\nHowever, the site, MarylandHealthConnection.gov, crashed soon after the October rollout and has sputtered along over roughly the past nine weeks, enrolling just 3,000 residents.\n\nHowever, state officials indicated earlier Friday that the site has shown some improvement, signing up roughly 700 more people in the week ending Nov. 30.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX
