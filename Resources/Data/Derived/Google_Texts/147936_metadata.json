On her Facebook page, she wrote that \u201cthe sick, the elderly, and the disabled\u201d would suffer most.\n\n\u201cThe America I know and love,\u201d Palin said, \u201cis not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama\u2019s \u2018death panel\u2019 so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their \u2018level of productivity in society,\u2019 whether they are worthy of health care. Such a system is downright evil.\u201d\n\nBut lawmakers crafting Obamacare did propose panels that would decide whether or not a health-care procedure was worth paying for. And now, as the Associated Press reports, changes for Medicare in 2016 include \u201ccoverage for end-of-life counseling.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the help you\u2019ll need to prepare your household for the realities of living under a centralized health-care system \u2014 order Dr. Lee Hieb\u2019s \u201cSurviving the Medical Meltdown: Your Guide to Living Through the Disaster of Obamacare\u201d\n\nThe AP said Medicare will pay clinicians to counsel patients about options for care at the end of life.\n\nThe report said the voluntary counseling would have been authorized earlier by Obamacare if not for the outcry prompted by Palin\u2019s \u201cdeath panel\u201d charge.\n\n\u201cHastily dropped from the law, the personalized counseling has been rehabilitated through Medicare rules,\u201d the report said.\n\nIn 2014, WND reported Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, who helped craft Obamacare as health-policy adviser at the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, said he thought people should die at the age 75.\n\nIn a column for Atlantic magazine, Emanuel, the brother of then-Obama adviser Rahm Emanuel, who now is Chicago\u2019s mayor, argued improvements in health care that extend life expectancies through vaccines, antibiotics and technological innovations end up \u201cstretching out old age,\u201d resulting in \u201ca progressive erosion of physical functioning.\u201d\n\nWhile Emanuel emphasized the personal benefits of forgoing measures that extend life, the unspoken issue is the scarcity of resources in a system beholden to a fixed government budget.\n\nIf older people don\u2019t follow his chosen course and willingly allow resources to be distributed more to the younger, productive workers in society, government bureaucrats will inevitably enter into those health-care decisions.\n\nEmanuel concluded that by the time he reaches 75, he will have lived \u201ca complete life\u201d in which he envisions having seen his children grow up, his grandchildren born and his life projects basically completed.\n\n\u201cDying at 75 will not be a tragedy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIndeed, I plan to have my memorial service before I die. And I don\u2019t want any crying or wailing, but a warm gathering filled with fun reminiscences, stories of my awkwardness, and celebrations of a good life.\u201d\n\nFour years ago, the Obama administration proposed a reimbursement scale for doctors who have an end-of-life talk with their patients, the Los Angeles Times reported. The plan, stemming from the Department of Health and Human Services, was tucked inside a massive Medicare regulatory bill unveiled on Capitol Hill.\n\nUnder the proposal, patients would not be required to talk to their doctors about end-of-life care. Rather, the measure only provides a means for doctors to bill Medicare for \u201cadvance-care planning,\u201d should the patient have such discussion, the news outlet said.\n\nGet your marching instructions from \u201cSurviving the Medical Meltdown: Your Guide to Living Through the Disaster of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nAt the beginning, the president proposed an Independent Payment Advisory Board, which would determine government reimbursement rates for medical procedures. It was that panel that mostly drew the tag \u201cdeath panel.\u201d\n\nRep. Michael Burgess, R-Texas, author of the book \u201cDoctor in the House,\u201d which is on the nationalization of health care, said the IPAB was a bad idea when ex-Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., proposed it and voters removed him from office, and it hasn\u2019t gotten better.\n\n\u201cNow for the first time ever the primary party for health care for seniors, Medicare, is going to be able to tell you what kind of care you can get, where and when you can get it and worst of all, when you\u2019ve had enough,\u201d he told WND.\n\n\u201cIf all you\u2019re looking to do is be able to figure how to take care of old people cheaply, this is the way to go,\u201d he said. \u201cIf what you want to provide is meaningful medical care, why would you set up or embellish a system that leads to waiting lists and rationing?\u201d\n\nIn 2010, about the time Obamacare was adopted, left-leaning New York Times economic columnist Paul Krugman said such \u201cdeath panels\u201d would end up saving \u201ca lot of money\u201d for the government.\n\nThe comments from Krugman, who also writes on the New York Times blogs, came during a discussion of \u201cObamacare\u201d on the ABC News Sunday program \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople on the right, they\u2019re simultaneously screaming, \u2018They\u2019re going to send all the old people to death panels,\u2019 and \u2018It\u2019s not going to save any money,'\u201d he said.\n\nAnother panelist interjected, \u201cDeath panels would save money.\u201d\n\nKrugman responded that the \u201cadvisory panel, which has the ability to make more or less binding judgments on saying this particular expensive treatment, actually doesn\u2019t do any good medically and so we are not going to pay for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is actually going to save quite a lot of money,\u201d he said. \u2018We don\u2019t know how much yet. The CBO gives it very little credit but, but most, most of the health care economists I talk to think that\u2019s going be a really, uh, a really major cost saving.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "You probably remember the controversy over Sarah Palin\u2019s charge six years ago that the Affordable Health Care Act would include \u201cdeath panels\u201d that would ration health care, effectively deciding in some cases who lives and who dies.
