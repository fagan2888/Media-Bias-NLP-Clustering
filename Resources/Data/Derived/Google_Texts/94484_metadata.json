Forrest Hill Academy may have closed in 2009, but the problem of the school-to-prison pipeline continues.\n\nThe Carver students are part of Project South\u2019s Youth Community Action Program (YCAP).\n\n\u201cThe 10 Mil 4 Real campaign (\u202a#\u200e10M4R) seeks to confront police brutality that youth face in schools on an everyday basis. Over 10 million dollars are pumped into the Atlanta Police Department to increase police presence in Atlanta Public Schools. Though safety is stated the intent [sic], our youth are being beaten, tazed, and terrorized everyday by these same police officers for small time school offenses,\u201d Project South said in a statement.\n\nOn Thursday, February 19, 2015, eight teens were gathered around a cluster of tables in a meeting room at Project South\u2019s office.\n\nCommunity organizer Jamar Raheem took notes on a whiteboard as the youth deliberated over the content of a survey, which is the first project of the campaign.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to reach out to youth ages thirteen to twenty-four at our school and in other schools and communities,\u201d Malika Benoit, a member of YCAP, told APN.\n\nTheir goal is to get 1,600 people to answer the survey which asks about respondents\u2019 experiences with School Resource Officers (SROs), which is what APS calls police officers stationed in schools.\n\nThe young organizers expect that the information they collect will prove a need for the changes they\u2019re calling for.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to get SROs out completely. But APS is putting $10 million into weapons and police cars when our textbooks are outdated and our Internet doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Jaequan Allison, another YCAP member, told APN.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a joke around Carver that we have our own S.W.A.T. team. Instead we need to put that money into better food, better books, job training, staff to help with childcare for those of us who are parents, healthcare, and transportation,\u201d Allison said.\n\nYouth organizers of 10 Mil 4 Real will initially focus on collecting testimonials and getting more students and community members involved. As the campaign unfolds, they will develop demands and seek meetings with APS officials.\n\n\n\n(END/2015)", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.2.8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda404\"", "article_summary": "(APN) ATLANTA \u2014 Carver High School students recently launched 10 Mil 4 Real, a campaign to challenge the role of police in Atlanta Public Schools (APS).\nOver 10 million dollars are pumped into the Atlanta Police Department to increase police presence in Atlanta Public Schools.\n\u201cThe 10 Mil 4 Real campaign (\u202a#\u200e10M4R) seeks to confront police brutality that youth face in schools on an everyday basis.\nYouth organizers of 10 Mil 4 Real will initially focus on collecting testimonials and getting more students and community members involved.\nThe Carver students are part of Project South\u2019s Youth Community Action Program (YCAP)."}
