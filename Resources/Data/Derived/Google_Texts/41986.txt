Rogers County Sheriff's Office arrested a Sand Springs man on burglary complaints and learned he also had an outstanding warrant for assaulting a police officer.

Cody Wayne Bell, 22, is being held on a $61,000 bond for first degree burglary and a $250,000 bond for outstanding warrants in Tulsa County.



Captain Jerry Smittle, RCSO, said deputies were investigating thefts from cars parked at Will Rogers Downs Saturday, March 15. With casino security's help, they were able to identify the suspect as Cody Wayne Bell from surveillance video.



While still at the race track and casino, deputies got calls of a burglary in progress at a nearby home in the 17100 block of Honeysuckle Lane.

They learned of a second home burglary where the homeowner got into a fight with the suspect who then ran away.

Deputies found Bell outside another home where the garage door was open, Smittle said. The suspect went inside the garage as officers approached. Smittle said he asked the homeowner if he knew Bell, and he answered, "No, I have never seen him in my life."

Bell was arrested for three complaints of first degree burglary. A destruction of property complaint was added when he kicked the console of a patrol car and broke the key off in the ignition.

The Sand Springs man had outstanding warrants for assault and battery of a peace officer, driving under the influence and resisting arrest. Tulsa County court records indicate that he was charged with those offenses in May, 2012.
