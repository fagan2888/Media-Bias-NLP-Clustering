My expectations are modest. I\u2019m hoping to recruit and enlist just a few allies. Here is the core program of our movement: When heading into a conversation on a sensitive subject, drop \u201cpolitical correctness,\u201d and replace it with \u201cpolite directness.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t decide what you think just yet. Instead, take a moment to visit my world as a professor teaching Western American studies. Let\u2019s head straight back in time to my classroom on March 6.\n\nGiven the centrality of Mormonism in the West\u2019s past, present and future, anyone teaching this course must devote time to that topic. Nonetheless, taking up this subject, a professor has reasons to feel on edge.\n\nThe digital world allows professors to scope out these circumstances with precision. You ask the students a multiple-choice question. They take out their clickers and choose a response. The responses appear on the screen as a bar graph.\n\nOn March 6, the clicker poll informs me that three students identified themselves as Mormons, and 12 students identified themselves as holders of anti-Mormon attitudes.\n\nLooking at that bar graph, I know two things: I do not want the students who are Mormon to feel vulnerable for their religious beliefs, and I do not want to prevent students who want to learn more to feel uncomfortable about asking questions. I will intervene if anyone speaks in ways that denigrate or demean the Latter-day Saints, but I will also intervene if anyone tries to cast an honest question as an unmistakable expression of anti-Mormon prejudice. I am, in other words, trying to steer our course toward polite directness, not political correctness.\n\nSex and race barely begin the catalogue of issues that can create sensitivity over political correctness. Add just a few of the big ones (religion, culture, party affiliation, income inequality, fossil fuel use, etc.), and political correctness can seem close to imposing a monastic regime of silence on classrooms and on civil society. And, grimmest of all, it comes close to suppressing and penalizing curiosity, the one utterly essential and indispensable item in a teacher\u2019s tool chest.\n\nAlmost half a century ago, I received a demonstration of the value of freely expressed honest curiosity. In our hometown, a friend and I had organized a workshop on race relations. The conversation among our participants limped along, hampered by caution and indirectness.\n\nAnd then a close relative of mine came for a visit. After listening to concerns about injustices and getting more perplexed, she suddenly exclaimed, \u201cJust what do you people want?\u201d\n\nI was mortified over my relative\u2019s ignorance, expressed with unfettered use of phrasing that was \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d long before the term was invented. And then I noticed that the conversation was thriving. My relative\u2019s question had set the conversation free of nervous indirection.\n\nAs I have personal reasons to believe, a hopeful movement can gain crucial force and aim from a guiding limerick:\n\nEducation requires talking\n\nWith respect, not with scorn or with mocking.\n\nThus, it\u2019s time to defect\n\nFrom the politically correct,\n\nAnd to open the doors we\u2019ve been locking.\n\nPatty Limerick is faculty director and chair of the Center of the American West at the University of Colorado.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Limerick: Let\u2019s aim to be politically direct, not politically correct", "title": "Limerick: Let\u2019s aim to be politically direct, not politically correct", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/14/limerick-lets-aim-to-be-politically-direct-not-politically-correct/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140314__Mormon-familyp1.jpg", "height": 483}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140314__Mormon-familyp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-14T11:31:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T00:19:46+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0270\"", "article_summary": "Sex and race barely begin the catalogue of issues that can create sensitivity over political correctness.\nI am, in other words, trying to steer our course toward polite directness, not political correctness.\n), and political correctness can seem close to imposing a monastic regime of silence on classrooms and on civil society.\nThus, it\u2019s time to defectFrom the politically correct,And to open the doors we\u2019ve been locking.\nWe have gathered to pause and reflectOn the concept, \u201cpolitically correct.\u201dWhile the right of free speechProtects freedom to screech,We\u2019ll still make a claim on respect."}
