A recurring theme when it comes to New Year\u2019s resolutions is the desire to better manage personal finances.\n\nAt the start of 2013, Betterment.com reported that 47 percent of Americans set resolutions related to self-improvement or education; 34 percent of people make a money-related resolution, emphasizing the prominent position financial matters have taken in Americans\u2019 minds as the economy slowly recovers.\n\nIn a new GoBankingRates survey, more than 1,700 participants were asked what their biggest financial goal is for the upcoming year; the results revealed that objectives in 2014 are spread across many personal finance categories.\n\nSurvey Results: What Is Your Biggest Financial Goal for 2014?\n\nOther resolutions for New Year\u2019s 2014, such as losing weight and reading more, could still be on the laundry list of goals for Americans in the upcoming year, but our survey results suggest that the holiday hangover might contribute to how individuals plan to approach the year ahead.\n\nSaving money weighed in at the top of the list, with 39.3 percent of respondents looking to pull back on spending, followed with paying down debt (29.3 percent).\n\nConversely, just 12 percent of participants said they intend on focusing their efforts on investing, and 10.6 percent said they\u2019re targeting a raise.\n\nThis inclination to save money and pay off debts comes as no surprise, especially as retail sales over November and December 2013 are expected to reach as much as $602.1 billion, according to the National Retail Federation.\n\nBased on the findings, Americans are starting off the new year cautiously, choosing to work with the money they have left over from the holiday season rather than hedge their bets on riskier financial goals early in the year.\n\nBiggest Financial Goal for New Year\u2019s 2014 by Gender\n\nOf those who decided to pursue a more aggressive money management approach, a gender divide arose in the poll results. Female respondents\u2019 financials goals were more likely to be conservative with \u201csave money\u201d (43.3 percent) and \u201cpay down debt\u201d (30.8 percent) as their top choices, while only 35.1 percent and 27.7 percent of males prioritized these goals, respectively.\n\nMale participants were more likely to select \u201cinvest\u201d (17 percent) and \u201cget a raise\u201d (12.2 percent) as their New Year\u2019s 2014 financial goals than females.\n\nDespite the general perception that women are more passive about their money and men are liable to take more risks when it comes to building wealth, there was no significant gender-related difference for the survey option \u201cbuild an emergency fund.\u201d\n\nThis suggests that, while men and women might differ in how they achieve immediate financial self-improvement, neither are necessarily focused on planning for unexpected expenses.\n\nPoll Results by Income\n\nAn interesting finding from the New Year\u2019s 2014 financial goal survey was the relationship between participants\u2019 chosen goal and their current income bracket.\n\nIncomes levels for $0-$24,999, $25,000-$49,999, $50,000-$74,999, $75,000-$99,999, $100,000-$149,999 and $150,000+ were identified in the poll. Surveyed individuals from two opposite income intervals \u2014 $0-$24,000 and $100,000-$149,000 \u2014 reported the most responses for \u201csave money\u201d and \u201cpay down debt.\u201d\n\n\u201cSave Money\u201d Responses\n\nFifty percent of those with an income of $100,000-149,999 reported this goal.\n\nComing in second, 42 percent of respondents with an income of $0-$24,999 chose \u201csave money\u201d as their 2014 financial goal.\n\n\u201cPay Down Debt\u201d Responses\n\nPeople with an income of $100,000-$149,000 reported the most responses (31.8 percent) for \u201cpay down debt,\u201d followed by participants earning $0-$24,000 (31.6 percent).\n\nThese results suggest that low-wage workers and those who are making significantly more money (though not at the highest income bracket surveyed) are looking to make controlled financial decisions (i.e. setting aside savings and reducing existing debt) to stabilize their wealth in 2014.\n\nOn the other hand, individuals identified within middle income brackets ($50,000-$74,999 and $75,000-$99,999) reported the most \u201cinvest\u201d responses.\n\nUnlike those making the lowest income levels, who don\u2019t have much money to risk, and those earning $100,000-$149,000 who likely already have an investment portfolio, respondents whose earnings fell in the middle might feel comfortable enough to sustain their cost of living in the new year, while making a few investing decisions to see how far they can get by the end of the year.\n\nWhat Does This Mean for New Year\u2019s 2014?\n\n2014 will certainly bring on more changes as the Affordable Care Act goes into full effect. With the uncertain future of these new regulations and how they affect Americans\u2019 pockets and the sluggish job market, workers are riddled with uncertainties on how their finances will fare.\n\nRespondents\u2019 financial goals are being influenced by these factors as well as the aftermath of spending during the holiday months.\n\nClick here for detailed analysis of these poll results.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Buried amid the current holiday shopping commotion is the idea that 2014 presents a clean slate for personal improvement.
