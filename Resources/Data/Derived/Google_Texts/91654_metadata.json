What does that mean for Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart\u2019s \u2018Get Hard\u2019 and future comedies?\n\nIf anyone can tackle race-based humor without stirring the P.C. police, it\u2019s Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart. Right?\n\nFerrell\u2019s liberal bona fides are hard to dispute. He spent years mocking President George W. Bush, to the Left\u2019s delight, created the progressive Funny or Die web site, shilled for Obamacare on said site, and even revisited his Dubya character on Broadway.\n\nHart is merely the hottest movie comic working today, a black superstar whose appeal crosses racial demographics.\n\nTheir first movie together, the March 27 release \u201cGet Hard,\u201d should be an early spring smash. Only the film\u2019s sneak screening at the SXSW festival in Austin was anything but a box office coronation. It was a virtual pitchforks and flaming torches affair.\n\n\u201cGet Hard\u201d casts Ferrell as a casually racist investment banker brought down for a crime he didn\u2019t commit. To prep for prison, he hires a black car wash attendant (Hart) to teach him how to survive in the Big House. He just assumes Hart\u2019s character is a thug, even though he\u2019s a squeaky clean family man. Let the barrage of racial stereotypes commence.\n\n\u2018Racist As F\u2014\u2019 The hipster throng greeted Ferrell and Hart like rock stars prior to the screening. But when the duo left and director Etan Cohen handled the post-screening Q&A, things got ugly. Think a particularly nasty Twitter conversation where nuance gets shoved aside.\n\nThat \u2018Blazing Saddles\u2019 script, now considered comedy gold, would need a Kickstarter.com jump just to get some initial funding. \u201cThis film seemed racist as f\u2014,\u201d one attendee said. That person wasn\u2019t alone. Indiewire.com summed up the screening\u2019s combustible spirit, while adding other elements of the film were similarly troubling: \u201cAlison Brie also steps in as Ferrell\u2019s \u2018cartoonishly materialistic fiancee,\u2019 with Craig T. Nelson playing her cash-rich father, in a portrayal that feels sexist. Variety also blew the whistle on the film\u2019s \u201coffensive\u201d humor with its early review. \u201cIf you\u2019re disturbed by white-collar crime, but not quite as disturbed as you are by gay sex, then congratulations: You might possess just the right combo of social conscience and unexamined homophobia needed to fully enjoy \u2018Get Hard.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnother Variety story suggested the fact that Ferrell\u2019s character isn\u2019t eager to perform oral sex on a man might be \u201chomophobic.\u201d\n\nSomewhere, Mel Brooks is shaking his head, giddy to have created groundbreaking comedies like \u201cThe Producers\u201d and \u201cBlazing Saddles\u201d in a non-P.C. era. Could he even get a studio lackey to take his calls today with his brand of button-pushing humor? That \u201cBlazing Saddles\u201d script, now considered comedy gold, would need a Kickstarter.com jump just to get some initial funding. The N-word? Forget it.\n\nThe Comedy World After \u2018Get Hard\u2019 So where does that leave \u201cGet Hard?\u201d Any press is good press, or so the saying goes. Plus, the Ferrell/Hart combination should override any fears of a box-office flop. The ramifications go beyond a single film.\n\nComedy is hard. Making people laugh without stepping on a single toe is making it even harder. Surely Hollywood insiders are watching the \u201cGet Hard\u201d dustup and wondering just what they can joke about in their next project. Dare they evoke race in their gags? If so, how do they do so without offending someone with an axe to grind and a Twitter account?\n\nComedy is hard. Making people laugh without stepping on a single toe is making it even harder. There are few places where comedians can try out edgy material without being punished for it. The stand-up circuit used to be such a place. Not any more, with the advent of phone cameras. Tracy Morgan\u2019s 2011 riff on having a gay son had him go through sensitivity-style punishment as a result. Daniel Tosh had to apologize in 2012 for making a rape joke during a stand-up routine.\n\nAnd, just recently, Comedy Central edited out several jokes from the Justin Bieber roast involving the untimely death of \u201cFast and Furious\u201d star Paul Walker. Of course the jokes were in poor taste. That\u2019s the whole point of a roast.\n\nWe\u2019re finding fewer topics to joke about, and racial humor remains at the top of that \u201cno go\u201d list.\n\nIt\u2019s ironic that two of the writers behind \u201cGet Hard\u201d (Ian Roberts and Jay Martel) work for \u201cKey & Peele,\u201d a rare oasis for humor built around racial observations. Still, given the \u201cGet Hard\u201d uproar, it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll see more watered down comedy. Content providers, fearful of the kind of backlash \u201cGet Hard\u201d is currently facing, may chart less challenging jokes.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Tue, 24 Mar 2015 07:54:14 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "We have fewer topics to joke about now that everyone's so touchy.
