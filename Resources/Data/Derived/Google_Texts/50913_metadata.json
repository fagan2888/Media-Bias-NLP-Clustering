After seeing images of the Sept. 28 tear gassing of demonstrators, many people view the situation in Hong Kong as one that has deteriorated into chaos. I seek to correct this perception.\n\nFirst, the police have not used tear gas since last Sunday evening due to widespread criticism from Hong Kongers and the international community alike. Although the exact strategy of the government remains unclear, it appears as if its current goal is to preserve the status quo (i.e., prevent escalation). Second, it seems that the overwhelming majority of demonstrators have remained cordial and non-violent. By walking through the central district called the Admiralty and the more distant area of Mongkok, I witnessed no demonstrator provoking police or damaging property. Instead, I saw a group of students using chemicals and a broom to clean up paint that had been sprayed on the street during one of the previous gatherings.\n\nAdvertisement One can note another example of the demonstrators preserving order by observing the supply trucks and stations. These entities distribute food, water, and first-aid. What is more, volunteers collect and remove the resulting trash build-up to maintain the cleanliness of the area.\n\nI overheard a classmate say ironically that this movement had given rise to an actual, functioning Marxist society. Although this point is debatable, the demonstration remains remarkably well-organized and restrained.\n\nReed H.
