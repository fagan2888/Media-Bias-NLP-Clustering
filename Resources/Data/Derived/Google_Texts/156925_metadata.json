Its latest climate commitment also covers water use and waste.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cHowever, given that nearly two-thirds of General Mills\u2019 GHG emissions and 99 percent of water use throughout our value chain occur upstream of our direct operations, primarily in agriculture, we\u2019ve also been focused on advancing sustainable agriculture,\u201d John Church, General Mills\u2019 executive vice president of supply chain operations, said in a blog post\n\nThe company plans to set concrete reduction targets in terms of emissions, water use, waste, packaging and transportation, it said. It will seek to eliminate deforestation for its supplies, improve watersheds and maintain a committee to track its progress.\n\nGeneral Mills also the Business for Innovative Climate & Energy Policy coalition, a group organized by corporate sustainability organization Ceres that advocates for sustainable policies and business practices.\n\n\u201cGeneral Mills is showing increasing leadership on climate change and we are proud to welcome the company as our newest member of BICEP,\u201d Ceres president Mindy Lubber, said in a statement.\n\nOxfam America, which pushes for food and beverage companies to make commitments to fight climate change through its Behind the Brands campaign, had gathered more than 230,000 signatures urging action from General Mills.\n\n\u201cToday General Mills has taken a bold step to be an industry leader in addressing the clear and present threat climate change poses to our food system,\u201d Monique van Zijl, director of the campaign, said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "General Mills promised to fight greenhouse gas emissions throughout its supply chain.", "description": "General Mills promised to fight greenhouse gas emissions throughout its supply chain.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Timothy Cama", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "General Mills promised to fight greenhouse gas emissions throughout its supply chain.", "title": "General Mills to reduce GHG emissions from agriculture", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/213517-general-mills-to-reduce-ghg-emissions-from-agriculture", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/213517-general-mills-to-reduce-ghg-emissions-from-agriculture", "dcterms.date": "2014-07-28T14:39-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Timothy Cama", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "General Mills, greenhouse gases, Ceres,,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-28T14:39:54-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/213517-general-mills-to-reduce-ghg-emissions-from-agriculture", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "General Mills promised to fight greenhouse gas emissions throughout its supply chain.", "card": "summary", "title": "General Mills to reduce GHG emissions from agriculture"}, "dcterms.title": "General Mills to reduce GHG emissions from agriculture"}, "article_summary": "Food producer General Mills Inc. committed Monday to reducing climate change-causing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from its entire supply chain, including the farms that produce its ingredients.\nGeneral Mills also the Business for Innovative Climate & Energy Policy coalition, a group organized by corporate sustainability organization Ceres that advocates for sustainable policies and business practices.\n\u201cGeneral Mills is showing increasing leadership on climate change and we are proud to welcome the company as our newest member of BICEP,\u201d Ceres president Mindy Lubber, said in a statement.\nADVERTISEMENT\u201cHowever, given that nearly two-thirds of General Mills\u2019 GHG emissions and 99 percent of water use throughout our value chain occur upstream of our direct operations, primarily in agriculture, we\u2019ve also been focused on advancing sustainable agriculture,\u201d John Church, General Mills\u2019 executive vice president of supply chain operations, said in a blog postThe company plans to set concrete reduction targets in terms of emissions, water use, waste, packaging and transportation, it said.\nOxfam America, which pushes for food and beverage companies to make commitments to fight climate change through its Behind the Brands campaign, had gathered more than 230,000 signatures urging action from General Mills."}
