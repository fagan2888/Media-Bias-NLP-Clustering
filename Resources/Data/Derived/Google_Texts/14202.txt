Responding to Brent Lewis’ letter, attacking socialism. I agree that pure socialism does not work, but in his argument, he is perpetuating a myth about healthcare. There is this belief among many Americans that foreigners are flocking here to get better healthcare.

This is simply not true. There are a few wealthy people who come here for healthcare, because if you are rich, and can pay cash, the U.S. does provide excellent healthcare. But for middle-class Americans who have insurance, the healthcare received is no better than what is received from government-paid healthcare found in Europe and Canada. Middle and lower-class Americans who don’t have insurance receive inferior healthcare.

It is silly to think that middle-class people would come to the U.S. for healthcare. How would they pay for it? I recently had a knee replacement, and the total cost was about $100,000. Lucky, I had good insurance and it didn’t cost me anything. Do you really think a middle-class person will come here for surgery and pay that kind of money when they could get the operation at home for free?

This silly myth was spread by anti-Obamacare politicians, and now is believed by millions of Americans.
