Obviously there are lots of candidates, but at this moment you would have to give the nod to John Roberts.\n\nLet us travel back in time all the way to the summer of 2005. Take literally one minute to listen to these famous words from earnest young appeals-court judge John Roberts:\n\nHumility. Modesty. Restraint. Deference to precedent. \"We're just calling balls and strikes.\"\n\nThat guy sounded so great. Really, watch this minute-long video and think what it would be like to have a person like that on the bench.\n\nInstead we have a chief justice who:\n\nin the \"Obamacare\" ruling two years ago, apparently decided that the institutional risk to the Court of blatantly coming across as just another branch of party politics outweighed the objections implicit in his prior rulings to the healthcare plan. So he found a way not to overturn the main legislative accomplishment of a president's first term, with all the hubbub that would ensue. As it happens, I was glad that the politics added up that way for him. But ...\n\nin this week's McCutcheon ruling, following Citizens United, he made up out of nowhere his own interpretation of how electoral politics and favor-trading works*\u2014trumping that of Congress, composed 100 percent of elected members. Plus he invented his own post-Founders, no-input-from-Congress, precedent-be-damned theory of what \"corruption\" means. As it happens, I disagree with the results of this one. But the main point is that in their activist political sensibility neither this judgment nor the Obamacare one had the slightest connection to the person who so self-effacingly presented himself for confirmation nine years ago.\n\n[* This interpretation, from the opinion:\n\n[T]he only type of corruption Congress may target is quid pro quo corruption. Spending large sums of money in connection with elections, but not in connection with an effort to control the exercise of an officeholder\u2019s official duties, does not give rise to such quid pro quo corruption. Nor does the possibility that an individual who spends large sums may garner \u201cinfluence over or access to\u201d elected officials or political parties.\n\nSee if anyone who has worked in politics recognizes that bright-line definition of the role of money in affecting politicians' behavior. The elected politicians who passed the campaign-finance laws didn't understand it that way. Then watch that video again. About judicial \"modesty.\"]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Life tenure in any public post is bad public policy, and other implications of the latest Supreme Court rulings", "author": "James Fallows", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Life tenure in any public post is bad public policy, and other implications of the latest Supreme Court rulings", "title": "Cynicism-in-Public-Life Contest, John Roberts Edition", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/04/SupCt/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/04/cynicism-in-public-life-contest-john-roberts-edition/360135/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce8f8\"", "article_summary": "Obviously there are lots of candidates, but at this moment you would have to give the nod to John Roberts.\nTake literally one minute to listen to these famous words from earnest young appeals-court judge John Roberts:Humility.\nReally, watch this minute-long video and think what it would be like to have a person like that on the bench.\nIf People magazine were based in D.C., instead of their Sexiest Man Alive specials they might run Most Cynical Person Alive contests.\nSee if anyone who has worked in politics recognizes that bright-line definition of the role of money in affecting politicians' behavior."}
