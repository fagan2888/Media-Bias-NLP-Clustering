Men's fashion does not get paid much attention during awards season, except when Pharrell sports a funky hat. E! News correspondent Ryan Seacrest does his best to change this every year. This time, he's questioning the arrival of blue tuxedos for men.

On the red carpet, Seacrest called Jason Sudeikis's decision to wear a blue tux "irreverent." Olivia Wilde did wear black, so it was somewhat of a daring move. We think they look great.

And then presenter Kevin Spacey also bucked tradition. His blue tux even has some black in it â€” crazy!

And three's a trend: Jim Carrey also chose a blue tux. With a black shirt. Everyone's looking like a bruise tonight.

It's happening, Seacrest, whether you like it or not.
