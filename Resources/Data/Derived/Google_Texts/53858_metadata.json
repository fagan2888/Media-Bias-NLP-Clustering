The clinics serve 17,000 patients a year on the South Coast.\n\n\u201cWe were basically kept alive by the community,\u201d Hicks said.\n\nSBNC announced the two-clinic expansion in November 2013 when it received the federal grant from the Health Resources and Services Administration. The grant recognized the underserved population in Goleta, and Hicks said it will provide about $650,000 per year for the two sites.\n\nThe federal grant helps fill the gap between cost of services and reimbursements, but SBNC still relies on community support to fund the rest of its clinics.\n\n\u201cOf course this is a big boost to an operation that\u2019s basically designed to lose money, just from the get-go,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cIt\u2019s an enormous help to us on a continuing basis.\u201d\n\nThe $1 million construction cost for the new clinic \u2014 which is located at 5580 Calle Real at Kellogg Avenue \u2014 was financed and donated, not grant-funded, and the new facility will start accepting patients in July, Goleta project manager Melissa McDermott said.\n\nThe single-story office building used to be a church and once was home to the Goleta Valley Chamber of Commerce, but it\u2019s impossible to tell after crews gutted the space and put up walls separating exam rooms, laboratories, waiting areas and physician and support staff offices.\n\nDr. Charles Fenzi, SBNC\u2019s chief medical officer, and Dr. Neil Patrick Sullivan helped design the new clinic space, which has six exam rooms, one procedure room, a medicine dispensary, and the required laboratories and bathrooms, McDermott said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s designed to have the patient experience be kind of like Ikea,\u201d she said.\n\nDuring a tour, she demonstrated how patients will enter through the waiting room and proceed counterclockwise through the clinic, moving from exam rooms to waiting areas with stops at the health promotion counselor\u2019s office to enroll in health insurance or social services, if needed, and the referral counselor.\n\nIt will be the only Santa Barbara Neighborhood Clinic with behavioral health services.\n\nSBNC only uses 60 percent of the building due to the limited construction funding, but has an application pending for $1 million in capital grant funds to take over the rest of the space and expand, McDermott said.\n\nThe largest expense is the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system, which has specific airflow requirements for each area of the clinic under federal standards, she said.\n\nMcDermott said a failure to meet HVAC requirements delayed the opening of SBNC\u2019s temporary medical clinic at 334 S. Patterson Ave., Suite 203, near Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital. That location will be closed after the permanent Calle Real location opens in July, she said.\n\nSBNC also will expand its \u200bOld Town Goleta dental clinic to nine chairs from three after leasing the other half of the building at 164 Kinman Ave., Suite A, for a capital cost of about $900,000.\n\nDemand for dental services is very high, particularly since SBNC accepts Denti-Cal, the dental insurance from Medi-Cal, McDermott said. Construction will start as soon as the Calle Real clinic is finished, she said.\n\nThe popular Eastside Dental Clinic has a six-month waiting list and the Goleta clinic already has a month-long waitlist after opening its doors last October.\n\n\u201cIn California, generally, we\u2019re told there is a real shortage of dental care available to the underserved,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cThis is a big increase in capacity, and we are convinced that the need is there.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Noozhawk news editor Giana Magnoli can be reached at .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address) .
