Ted Cruz, refuses to condemn Trump based on Reagan's Eleventh Commandment not to speak ill of a fellow Republican, Goldberg notes. Yet Cruz has never before had a problem calling out other Republicans as part of his tea party appeal.Cruz happily criticizes Republicans when it will help him, but steers clear of Trump in hopes of getting his voters if he drops out of the race, Goldberg says.\"Similarly, I'm constantly hearing from Trump fans that it's 'disrespectful' for me to criticize the Republican front-runner \u2014 as if these fans would refrain from criticizing Jeb or Rubio or Kasich if they were in the lead,\" Goldberg says.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Jonah goldberg, conservatives, gaga, donald trump, celebrity", "pubdate": "2015-09-06T21:29:17", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Conservatives who have gone gaga over GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump are guilty of the same actions of the liberals they like to lambaste for blindly following and voting for celebrity-types, writes Jonah Goldberg at National Review. \r\nGoldberg admits there are...", "title": "Jonah Goldberg: Trump Devotees Blindly Follow, Like Liberals", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/Jonah-goldberg-conservatives-gaga-donald-trump/2015/09/06/id/673880/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=2395567d-58ac-4fd4-849a-fbcf65f6e487&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/Jonah-goldberg-conservatives-gaga-donald-trump/2015/09/06/id/673880/", "title": "Jonah Goldberg: Trump Devotees Blindly Follow, Like Liberals", "description": "Conservatives who have gone gaga over GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump are guilty of the same actions of the liberals they like to lambaste for blindly following and voting for celebrity-types, writes Jonah Goldberg at National Review. \r\nGoldberg admits there are...", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1441574957, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "Jonah goldberg, conservatives, gaga, donald trump, celebrity", "article": {"section": "Politics", "published_time": "2015-09-06T21:29:17"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/Jonah-goldberg-conservatives-gaga-donald-trump/2015/09/06/id/673880/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Conservatives who have gone gaga over GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump are guilty of the same actions of the liberals they like to lambaste for blindly following and voting for celebrity-types, writes Jonah Goldberg at National Review. \r\nGoldberg admits there are..."}, "article_summary": "Conservatives who have gone gaga over GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump are guilty of the same actions of the liberals they like to lambaste for blindly following and voting for celebrity-types, writes Jonah Goldberg at National Review.\n\"One of Trump's presidential rivals, Texas Sen.
