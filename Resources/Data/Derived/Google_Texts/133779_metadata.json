That thinking has since changed: One was issued this morning that takes effect tomorrow morning at 6 a.m. and, for now, lasts till 9 p.m. Sunday.\n\nThe reason: The cold front just to our north is potent \u2014 temperatures in Nebraska are in the single digits \u2014 and it\u2019s now scheduled to arrive well before the Pacific front that drenched California Friday. That means bridges and overpasses will have plenty of time to cool down before the precipitation arrives, mainly in the form of freezing rain. So, yes, it\u2019ll be warm again today, with highs once more around 80. But that won\u2019t mean much in, say, 24 hours.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been so warm the last couple of days it\u2019s unlikely to be a big ice event,\u201d says Dennis Cavanaugh, meteorologist with the National Weather Service. \u201cBut bridges and overpasses will cool below freezing, and a few hours below freezing should do it, so it won\u2019t take much to get ice. And if it sleets, they\u2019ll freeze.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the timing at present: Cavanaugh says the cold front should arrive around 6-7 a.m. Sunday, maybe a little earlier. You\u2019ll notice it: Winds will kick up; temperatures will plummet, from the 50s to the freezing mark in a matter of hours. There could be some light precipitation accompanying the front as well, as it\u2019s warm and humid here thanks to Gulf moisture.\n\nAround midday is when the upper-level Pacific system is due in North Texas, and, says Cavanaugh, \u201cThat brings the bulk of whatever precipitation falls. Unfortunately, we are expected to be well behind the cold front at that time.\u201d\n\nHe says we\u2019re mainly looking at freezing rain, which falls as a liquid then becomes the temperature of whatever it lands on. So, yes, the neighborhood streets could stay above freezing thanks to two days\u2019 worth of springlike temperatures. But, as always, look out for those bridges and overpasses \u2026 especially if we see some sleet, which is also possible.\n\n\u201cThe difference between freezing rain and sleet is a small change in the temperature at ground level,\u201d Cavanaugh says. \u201cRight now we\u2019re thinking freezing rain is most likely, but it wouldn\u2019t take much to turn it into sleet. It\u2019ll be interesting.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE0LzAzL21hcmNoLWNvbWVzLWluLWxpa2UtYS1saW9uLWluLXdpbnRlci1maXJzdC10aGUtc3Ryb25nLWNvbGQtZnJvbnQtdGhlbi10aGUtY2hhbmNlLW9mLWZyZWV6aW5nLXJhaW4tc3VuZGF5Lmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert Wilonsky", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "On Friday the National Weather Service didn't believe there would be the need to issue a winter weather advisory for North Texas for Sunday.
