Ronnie Hillman and Kayvon Webster inched toward availability for the season opener, participating in individual drills on Wednesday. They were limited in Monday’s practice as a concession to an undisclosed medical issue that surfaced last Thursday. They required medical attention and returned to Denver last Saturday, delayed by a day because they didn’t have proper identification to travel.

Offensive guard Ben Garland missed his second consecutive practice with a minor ankle injury. He suffered the injury last Thursday against the Cowboys.

Hillman and Webster create depth at critical positions. Hillman figures to see plenty of snaps as Montee Ball’s backup. Ball played one series in the preseason because of an appendectomy, so it’s unrealistic to think he won’t be spelled against the Colts. Webster functions as a top corner in nickel packages. He lost traction, however, in the preseason, suffering a sprained ankle followed by missing Thursday’s game with his illness. He required help from a teammate to leave the locker room in Dallas after the game.

Webster and rookie Bradley Roby are the Broncos’ top reserve cornerbacks behind Aqib Talib and Chris Harris, who likely will need rest while playing his first game since Jan. 12 after tearing the ACL in his left knee.
