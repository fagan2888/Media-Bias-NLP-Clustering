Though Escobar does not believe he will need to be placed on the 15-day disabled list, he was scheduled to have an MRI exam Saturday.\n\n\u201cHe says he feels okay, so the results will tell us more and we\u2019ll be able to make a decision,\u201d manager Matt Williams said. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re just waiting on him to have that test.\u201d\n\nEscobar spoke to reporters Saturday morning with bullpen catcher Nilson Robledo serving as a translator. When asked if he expected to play this week, Escobar said he planned to take one day off, start a routine as prescribed by trainers and go from there. He was also asked whether he believes he needs to go on the disabled list.\n\nSEE ALSO: Craig Stammen remains resolute after likely season-ending injury\n\n\u201cWhat kind of words is that?\u201d he said, via Robledo. \u201cNo, he don\u2019t understand DL.\u201d\n\nEscobar\u2019s injury left the Nationals with no healthy infielders on their bench for Saturday\u2019s game against the Philadelphia Phillies. Tyler Moore took ground balls at third base before the game and was the team\u2019s contingency plan should Ian Desmond, Danny Espinosa or Dan Uggla sustain an injury.\n\nWilliams said there is no chance first baseman Ryan Zimmerman, who previously played third, would move back to his old position. Moore has not played at third base in a professional game, nor during his one year at Mississippi State.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s played there before. It\u2019s been a long time, college I think,\u201d Williams said. \u201cBut he\u2019s an infielder, so he understands the process of catching it and throwing it. But he looked fine. Just wanted to get him out there in case we have to put him in the game for whatever reason. Get him some groundballs out there. But he looked fine.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals are expected to make at least one move Sunday, reinstating Denard Span from the disabled list and moving Craig Stammen to the 60-day disabled list. Whether they make another move involving Escobar remains to be seen.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Escobar was not in Washington's lineup Saturday after sustaining the injury Friday night.
