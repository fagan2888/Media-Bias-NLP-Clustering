The ongoing saga of the Little Sisters of the Poor clarifies the inexplicable. This case confirms what Obamacare detractors have been saying for quite a while. President Obama\u2019s intent had nothing to do with facilitating health care for Americans. It was all about control.\n\nFirst Amendment Right to Religious Freedom?\n\nThe Mother Provincial for the Little Sisters of the Poor, Sr. Loraine Marie Maguire, wrote in \u201cLittle Sisters of the Poor Say \u2018Yes\u201d to the Court\u201d how she tried to settle the suit against the federal government, currently at the Supreme Court, but to no avail. The Little Sisters believe that the Obamacare mandate to provide contraceptives and abortifacients constrains their First Amendment right to religious freedom. Apparently, during oral arguments, the justices asked both sides if there were ways to solve the dilemma without violating the Sisters\u2019 faith or forcing a decision from them.\n\nThe Little Sisters said yes and showed several ways to resolve their differences. The Obama administration conceded that alternatives already did exist and that cost was not a factor. Nonetheless, Washington demurred.\n\nHow can one explain their refusal?\n\nIt\u2019s Not About Health Care Or Religious Freedom\n\nThe answer is simple. The government\u2019s disagreement with the Little Sisters \u2013 as well as the entire Obamacare law \u2013 has nothing to do with good health for the American people. Furthermore, Obamacare has nothing to do with the fiscal welfare of our country. Obamacare is solely a means of extending the scope, expanding the reach, and amplifying the power of the federal government. It is the progressive political agenda made manifest using health care as a vehicle.\n\nThere is no other way to explain spending more than $2 billion (!) on a website: healthcare.gov. For that money, we could give Sovaldi, which costs $1,000/pill, to every patient with Hepatitis C in the entire United States and cure them.\n\nHow does Washington justify Obamacare spending $2.6 trillion \u201chealth care\u201d dollars on failed Co-Ops, unnecessary Exchanges, cancelled CLASS Act and PCIP, useless risk corridors, more than 1400 exemptions, \u201cfree\u201d Medicaid insurance that does not lead to good care, insurance carriers leaving the market, consulting fees to contemptible and contemptuous Jonathan Gruber et al, as well as legal fees to defend this most unpopular of all social welfare programs. Does rationing our medical care through Obamacare\u2019s IPAB produce healthier Americans?\n\nIt\u2019s All About Control\n\nThe purpose of these all actions becomes clear when you recognize the true but covert purpose behind Obama\u2019s so-called reform of the American healthcare system. It was all about control: he cared not one whit about We the Patients.\n\nAs a physician, I am furious with Washington when I think how much health care American doctors cannot provide Americans when healthcare dollars are diverted from care to expand Obama\u2019s bureaucratic control. When people rail (rightly) at how much our country is overspending on our healthcare system, ask them to look at where our \u201chealth care\u201d dollars are going \u2013 not to patients or to doctors!\n\nPre-election Postscript\n\nPresidential candidate Bernie Sanders is quite overt with regard to his health care policy, MediCAID-for-All, which he disingenuously calls Medicare-for-All. He wants total government control of healthcare using the Single Payer model.\n\n\u201cDr. Deane\u201d Waldman MD MBA is the author of the FREE Healthcare Decoder; The Cancer in the American Healthcare System; and just released, Our Allies Have Become Our Enemies.
