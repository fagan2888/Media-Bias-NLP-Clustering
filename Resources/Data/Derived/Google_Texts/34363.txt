Anderson Cooper Fires Back After GOP Rep Accuses Him of Journalistic Bias

'When you’re not on Fox News, you get contentious interviews,' Cooper told Republican congressman Raul Labrador during a heated exchange Monday.

Anderson Cooper got into a heated exchange with Republican congressman Raul Labrador during an interview on Monday’s episode of Anderson Cooper 360.

While discussing the impasse that has led to the government shutdown, Cooper questioned the logic behind the actions of the GOP, asking why the party wouldn’t simply introduce a bill that would end the shutdown. “You’re nullifying two presidential elections and you’re nullifying the vote of Congress because you don’t like [the Affordable Care Act],” Cooper said.

Shortly thereafter, Labrador accused Cooper of being biased against Republicans, to which the journalist responded, “This is the way it works in journalism. When you’re not on Fox News, you get contentious interviews. When you’re not on MSNBC and a liberal, you get contentious interviews. My job is to ask you questions that are different than you think.”
