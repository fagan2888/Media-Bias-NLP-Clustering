The link to his post now leads to an error page.\n\nThe American Democracy Legal Fund, a Democratic watchdog group, filed a complaint on Monday with the Senate Ethics Committee, alleging that Johnson violated the Senate Ethics Manual \u2019s Internet policy, which says senators and staff members cannot use Senate Internet \u201cfor personal, promotional, commercial, or partisan political purposes.\u201d The group, founded by veteran political operative Brad Woodhouse, calls for an investigation.\n\nWASHINGTON -- Blog posts on Sen. Ron Johnson's (R-Wis.) official Senate website, including one that a watchdog group complains violated ethics rules, have mysteriously been taken down.\n\nThe American Democracy Legal Fund\u2019s complaint addresses a different blog post that has since been removed, arguing that \u201cSenator Johnson blatantly used his Senate website to attack a political opponent\u201d when his staff responded to a fact-check article by PolitiFact Wisconsin.\n\nPolitiFact in June dug into a claim made by former Wisconsin Sen. Russ Feingold (D) that Johnson is \u201copposed to all government-assisted student loans.\u201d The organization rated Feingold\u2019s statement as \u201cmostly true,\u201d citing numerous interviews and news reports in which Johnson takes a firm stance against the role of the federal government in student loan programs.\n\nThe complaint alleges that much of Johnson's blog post responding to the article was directly aimed at Feingold. Feingold is running to become Johnson\u2019s Democratic opponent in 2016, hoping to reclaim a seat that Johnson wrested from Feingold in 2010.\n\n\u201cHad Senator Feingold said that Senator Johnson has consistently pointed out that Washington policy on college assistance has serious negative unintended consequences, then he would have been right,\u201d reads the deleted post.\n\nThe post also attacks PolitiFact, saying that the organization \u201cseems to have a hard time being honest about what words mean.\u201d It tries to tie PolitiFact to Feingold, concluding that it \"apparently sees the world in exactly the way a left-wing Democrat who spent 18 years in Washington would.\u201d\n\nThe third post that has been removed also took aim at a PolitiFact report, this one on Johnson claiming that Feingold was \u201cthe deciding vote\u201d when the Senate approved the Affordable Care Act in 2010. PolitiFact deemed Johnson's assertion \u201cmostly false.\u201d Johnson\u2019s post mocked PolitiFact\u2019s fact-checking and rating system by giving his own \u201cruling\u201d on the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, which runs PolitiFact Wisconsin.\n\nAn archived version of Johnson\u2019s blog shows that the posts were removed sometime within the last month.\n\nNeither Johnson\u2019s office nor the Senate Ethics Committee responded to requests for comment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senators and staff are banned from using Senate Internet for \u201cpartisan political purposes.\u201d", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-08-06 18:14:41 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Senators and staff are banned from using Senate Internet for \u201cpartisan political purposes.\u201d", "title": "GOP Senator Quietly Removes Blog Posts That May Have Violated Ethics Rules", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ron-johnson-blog_us_55c27b6ae4b0923c12bb6bcd", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/55c27d681700006e00566b53.jpeg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Senators and staff are banned from using Senate Internet for \u201cpartisan political purposes.\u201d", "creator": "@marinafang", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/55c27d681700006e00566b53.jpeg", "height": 1000}, "title": "GOP Senator Quietly Removes Blog Posts That May Have Violated Ethics Rules", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-08-05 18:14:41 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_55c27b6ae4b0923c12bb6bcd", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Ron Johnson,senate ethics committee,Ethics,lego movie,ron johnson lego movie, politifact", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Ron Johnson,senate ethics committee,Ethics,lego movie,ron johnson lego movie, politifact", "published_time": "2015-08-05 18:14:41 -0400", "modified_time": "2015-08-05 18:14:41 -0400", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/marina.fang"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0f93\"", "article_summary": "An archived version of Johnson\u2019s blog shows that the posts were removed sometime within the last month.\nThe complaint alleges that much of Johnson's blog post responding to the article was directly aimed at Feingold.\nWASHINGTON -- Blog posts on Sen.
