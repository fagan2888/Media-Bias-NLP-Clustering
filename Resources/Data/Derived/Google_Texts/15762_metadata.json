As commentators hurried to point out, this is precisely the tactic the ex-KGB officer habitually employs when discussing his political foes, such as the de facto opposition leader, Alexei Navalny.\n\nMr. Putin\u2019s response underlined just how far Mr. Medvedev, 48, has fallen since the start of his one-term presidency in 2008, when he came to office pledging to \u201cmodernize\u201d Russia and restore belief in the rule of law.\n\nBut Mr. Medvedev\u2019s presidency was little more than a ploy to help Mr. Putin \u2014 who shifted to the post of prime minister for four years \u2014 sidestep constitutional limits on presidential terms.\n\nMr. Medvedev was unable to push through any meaningful reforms during his term, acknowledging late in his presidency that skeptics who predicted he would fail to eradicate problems such as ingrained corruption were \u201cabsolutely right.\u201d\n\nSince Mr. Putin\u2019s return to the Kremlin for a third term in May 2012, Mr. Medvedev has been sidelined, with scant mention of him in state media and widespread speculation that his days as head of government are numbered. Mr. Medvedev also has been publicly criticized by state officials, including Russia\u2019s chief investigator, and even by members of the ruling United Russia party, which he leads.\n\nMr. Putin\u2019s displeasure with Mr. Medvedev is widely believed to stem from his former protege\u2019s measured support for the protest movement that emerged after the disputed 2011 parliamentary elections. Mr. Medvedev said last year that the demands of Kremlin critics were \u201creasonable\u201d and urged authorities to \u201ctake action\u201d on them.\n\nIt\u2019s not only Mr. Putin and his allies who are taking potshots at Mr. Medvedev. His spectacular failure to implement change during his time in the Kremlin means he also has lost the support of Russians who swept into Moscow\u2019s streets to protest Mr. Putin\u2019s rule in 2011 and 2012. Notwithstanding Mr. Medvedev\u2019s championing of human rights, several high-profile journalists and human rights workers were killed or beaten during his tenure, leading to widespread disillusionment with the would-be reformer.\n\n\u201cIt was very symbolic for me that I was attacked during Medvedev\u2019s rule,\u201d said prominent protester and journalist Oleg Kashin, who survived an attempt on his life in Moscow in 2010. \u201cLike many other people, I\u2019d hoped we might see a different Russia under Medvedev. But Medvedev cynically exploited our trust.\u201d\n\nAlthough the odds may appear stacked against him, Mr. Medvedev has not given up on a return to the presidency. He has, however, ruled out running against Mr. Putin, who will be eligible to run for a fourth term in 2018.\n\nOpinion polls make grim reading for Mr. Medvedev and his presidential ambitions.\n\nA survey by the independent Levada Center pollster in November indicated that a scant 1 percent of Russians would be prepared to back Mr. Medvedev in any presidential bid. The figure put Mr. Medvedev behind Mr. Navalny, who had 5 percent support despite a state media smear campaign.\n\nAll of this is a far cry from the height of Mr. Medvedev\u2019s popularity shortly after his 2008 election as president, when his approval ratings were near 70 percent.\n\n\u201cMedvedev has lost everything possible,\u201d said former Kremlin spin doctor Gleb Pavlovsky. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why he is even talking about the 2018 presidential elections. He has no one and nothing to go into them with. Perhaps he is counting on Putin making him president again? But even Putin doesn\u2019t have enough power to make him president once more.\u201d\n\nAlthough his government\u2019s approval ratings are falling sharply, Mr. Medvedev is unlikely to be dismissed from the post of prime minister in the near future, as Mr. Putin is keen to avoid any major political shake-ups ahead of his showcase project, the Winter Olympics in Russia\u2019s Black Sea resort of Sochi.\n\nStanislav Belkovsky, a former Kremlin insider, said the unthreatening Mr. Medvedev is a convenient scapegoat for Mr. Putin as Russia\u2019s economy slows and authorities are forced to introduce belt-tightening measures. With Mr. Putin\u2019s approval ratings at their lowest levels since he first came to power in 2000, he badly needs someone to blame, they say.\n\n\u201cEven if Medvedev\u2019s government is removed, this will change nothing,\u201d Mr. Belkovsky said. \u201cThere is no point in the sudden dismissal of such a compliant head of government. Medvedev is ideal as a lightning rod for unpopular decisions.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "When asked recently to name Russia's No. 2 politician, President Vladimir Putin offered up as potential candidates the leader of the Communist Party, an eccentric ultranationalist and even a loyal member of the Kremlin-created parliamentary \"opposition.\"", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "When asked recently to name Russia\u2019s No. 2 politician, President Vladimir Putin offered up as potential candidates the leader of the Communist Party, an eccentric ultranationalist and even a loyal member of the Kremlin-created parliamentary \u201copposition.\u201d", "title": "Russia\u2019s powerful Putin sets up Medvedev for a political fall", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/25/russias-powerful-putin-sets-up-medvedev-for-a-poli/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/25/12252013_ap130622199588201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/25/12252013_ap130622199588201.jpg", "description": "When asked recently to name Russia's No. 2 politician, President Vladimir Putin offered up as potential candidates the leader of the Communist Party, an eccentric ultranationalist and even a loyal mem", "card": "summary", "title": "Russia\u2019s powerful Putin sets up Medvedev for a political fall"}, "Author": "Marc Bennetts - Special to The Washington Times", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Dmitry Medvedev, Putin  Batman, Russia, Alexey Navalny"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca27b\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s not only Mr. Putin and his allies who are taking potshots at Mr. Medvedev.\nThe figure put Mr. Medvedev behind Mr. Navalny, who had 5 percent support despite a state media smear campaign.\n\u201cPutin spoke condescendingly [of Mr. Medvedev], which is much worse than any insult,\u201d political analyst Mikhail Rostovsky said.\nHe has, however, ruled out running against Mr. Putin, who will be eligible to run for a fourth term in 2018.\nMr. Putin\u2019s displeasure with Mr. Medvedev is widely believed to stem from his former protege\u2019s measured support for the protest movement that emerged after the disputed 2011 parliamentary elections."}
