Ted Cruz is still a Canadian citizen. Although it has now been over a month since he promised to renounce his Canadian citizenship \u2013 which he obtained by virtue of his birth in Calgary, Alberta \u2013 there has been no indication (whether press release, statement or otherwise) announcing that he has followed through on the commitment.\n\nCruz\u2019s website is silent on the subject, his official biography doesn\u2019t even mention the word \u201cCanada,\u201d and I received no response to repeated email requests for additional information. My telephone inquiry to Cruz\u2019s press office produced only an email that repeated his statement of future intention, as first issued on Aug. 19: \u201cI will renounce any Canadian citizenship. Nothing against Canada, but I\u2019m an American citizen by birth and as a U.S. senator, I believe I should be only an American.\u201d\n\nWhile Cruz\u2019s sentiment was surely sincere at the time, it does appear that he is still holding on to both his Canadian citizenship and his Senate seat. I can\u2019t really fault him for any ambivalence. I am a dual U.S./Canadian citizen myself, and I intend to stay that way, but, then again, I am not planning to run for president. Cruz, on the other hand, has already started courting conservatives in Iowa. So the question must be asked: What is keeping Ted Cruz from finally renouncing his Canadian citizenship?\n\nPerhaps Cruz simply hasn\u2019t gotten around to it. In fairness, the Canadian government requires more than a simple shout-out before canceling somebody\u2019s citizenship. The aspiring ex-Canadian has to pay a fee of $100 and submit an official \u201cApplication to Renounce Canadian Citizenship,\u201d which could be a bother for someone with a busy schedule of Tea Party meetings and lectures for the Heritage Foundation. On the other hand, the renunciation form is pretty simple. There are only 12 questions on the application, and most of them request basic information such as name, address and date of birth, all of which could be handled by a staffer.\n\nThere is one section, however, that could cause Cruz some trouble, and perhaps that is the reason for his delay. Question 5 instructs the applicant to \u201cattach proof\u201d that he is (or will become) a citizen of a country other than Canada. That may seem like it is none of Canada\u2019s business, but in fact the requirement follows from important principles of international law \u2013 including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \u2013 which call upon governments to protect individuals from becoming stateless. Of course, Canada\u2019s requirement of proof was not established with U.S. senators in mind, but it does reflect an admirable intention to ensure that all individuals have national rights in at least one country. And in any event, it is up to Canada to decide how and in what manner its citizenship may be annulled \u2013 the U.S. has similar rules \u2013 and Cruz has no choice but to follow the necessary protocol.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What's really keeping Ted Cruz from finally renouncing his Canadian citizenship?
