He\u2019d come to warn us against the dangers of rock by revealing secret messages hidden backwards in the music, scaring our parents by exposing symbols of the Illuminati tucked away in band photos and barcodes, and showing slides of Nikki Sixx and Tommy Lee surrounded by scantily clad women with long tan legs and raven eyes.\n\n\u201cBut these guys,\u201d he fumed, \u201care the worst.\u201d\n\nWith a flick of his wrist the slide advanced. Four poor-looking sad sacks stood solemnly outside the gates of a cathedral. Their hair was long and straggly. Three of them had giant mustaches. To me, they looked just like the dudes who played Jesus\u2019s crew in the Easter play.\n\n\u201cGod,\u201d the preacher spat, shaking his head with disgust, \u201chelp us all\u2026.\u201d\n\nLater, I found the Sabbath records in my uncle\u2019s stash. The one the preacher banged against the pulpit was there so I listened to it while staring at the cover. The music sounded like the cover looked \u2013 purple and wavy and black. I flipped the cover over and found lyrics urging the listener to consider Christ and the state of one\u2019s soul and how the love of God is the only thing that can save us from sin and hate.\n\nWhat?\n\nHow could the little preacher be so wrong?\n\nBy the time I reached junior high, Sabbath had captivated me musically, philosophically and theologically as well. I was already a drummer with a fair grip on jazz but I swapped a set of golf clubs for a beat-up SG bass and set out learning Sabbath standards such as \u201cSupernaut\u201d and \u201cChildren of the Sea\u201d while studying Bible passages from Job, Psalms and Revelation. Somehow, it all seemed to fit: Tony, Ozzy, Geezer and Bill were like horsemen of the apocalypse, modern day apostles, voices crying out in the wilderness, prophets and madmen bringing an honest message about good and evil, choice and consequence, faith versus despair, free will versus destiny and the seemingly endless war between Heaven and Hell.\n\nDid the band stray too far into substance abuse at times? Well, yeah. Did their image get convoluted and misconstrued by record labels? Sure. Do prophets and apostles have a long history of being misunderstood? Nearly always, in their time.\n\nSo I had to wonder. Could Black Sabbath secretly be . . . a Christian band?\n\n\u201c\u2018Ello, Jamie?\u201d a familiar voice says.\n\n\u201cYes sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is Geezah Butler calling. How are you t\u2019day, mate?\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve got Terrence \u201cGeezer\u201d Butler on the line, bass player for Black Sabbath, Classic Rock Living Legend, member of both the U.K. Music and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and one of the most influential musicians and lyricists of all time.\n\nI\u2019m interviewing him for Bass Guitar Magazine and, as an erstwhile kid bassist who cut his teeth on classic Sabbath, it\u2019s an honor to talk guitars, amps and gear with one of heavy metal\u2019s true founding fathers. But with a bit of time remaining, I\u2019ve gotta ask Geezer about Sabbath and God.\n\n(Thanks to BGM editor Joel McIver for allowing this excerpt.)\n\nWhen I was a boy I heard a preacher claim that Black Sabbath\u2019s music was evil. I got my uncle\u2019s copy of Master of Reality and saw the lyrics were actually \u2014 quite Christian. Did you get any backlash over Sabbath singing a message of repentance and God being the only way to love?", "article_metadata": {"description": "The legendary Terrence Butler on Northern Ireland, Satan and the band's tortured relationship with Christianity", "title": "\u201cWe are whatever you want us to be\u201d: The gospel according to Black Sabbath", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The legendary Terrence Butler on Northern Ireland, Satan and the band's tortured relationship with Christianity", "title": "\u201cWe are whatever you want us to be\u201d: The gospel according to Black Sabbath", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/14/we_are_whatever_you_want_us_to_be_the_gospel_according_to_black_sabbath_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/AP856342475793-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The legendary Terrence Butler on Northern Ireland, Satan and the band's tortured relationship with Christianity", "title": "\u201cWe are whatever you want us to be\u201d: The gospel according to Black Sabbath", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/AP856342475793-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "JAMIE BLAINE", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Black Sabbath, Christianity, Jesus Christ, Ozzy Osbourne, The Weekling", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1732\"", "article_summary": "Could Black Sabbath secretly be .\nWhen I was a boy I heard a preacher claim that Black Sabbath\u2019s music was evil.\nDid you get any backlash over Sabbath singing a message of repentance and God being the only way to love?\n\u201cGod,\u201d the preacher spat, shaking his head with disgust, \u201chelp us all\u2026.\u201dLater, I found the Sabbath records in my uncle\u2019s stash.\nBut with a bit of time remaining, I\u2019ve gotta ask Geezer about Sabbath and God."}
