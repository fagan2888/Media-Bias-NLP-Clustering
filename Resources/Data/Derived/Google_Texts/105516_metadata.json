Susana Martinez to approve Medicaid expansion and creation of state health care exchanges, up to 172,000 uninsured New Mexicans are expected to receive medical coverage in the coming year.\n\nBut who\u2019s going to treat them?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big problem and there\u2019s nothing in place to address that issue,\u201d, a Santa Fe surgeon who specializes in the treatment of breast cancer, told New Mexico Watchdog.\n\nAccording to the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, New Mexico is short an estimated 2,000 physicians and roughly 400-600 primary care specialists.\n\nThe problem is especially acute in sparsely populated counties in the southern and northwestern parts of the state. In 2006, more than half the physicians in New Mexico were located in the state\u2019s largest county, Bernalillo County.\n\n\u201cThe number of healthcare professionals and their maldistribution throughout the state cannot adequately meet current demand, let alone the additional pressures brought about by the newly insured in 2014,\u201d a report from the Legislative Finance Committee warned.\n\nAdding to the problem? New Mexico already has more older people than the general population of the United States:\n\n\u201cA lot of the hospitals in the state are trying to recruit (doctors),\u201d Zerbach said. \u201cThe bigger hospital companies have more financial fortitude to do those kinds of things, but a lot of the smaller community hospitals really are struggling with that issue. And there\u2019s nothing in place with the new health care law, or any of the things that are happening on the state level, that are going to fix that problem.\u201d\n\nSomething\u2019s got to give, and it seems a virtual certainty there will be longer wait times for patients, especially new ones.\n\n\u201cMost New Mexicans will likely feel the pinch of an inadequate healthcare workforce,\u201d the LFC report said.\n\nHow long people will wait is hard to tell, but when Massachusetts reformed its health care system in 2006 average wait times for primary care and specialty care appointments exceeded 40 days, the report said.\n\nDr. J.R. Damron, a radiologist who serves as chairman of the newly-created New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange, concedes the problems will likely get worse as Obamacare rolls out.\n\n\u201cI think access to care is going to be a very big issue,\u201d Damron told New Mexico Watchdog. \u201cWe can build this exchange, we can have the framework \u2026 but are we going to have enough health care providers to take care of those individuals?\u201d\n\nTo help fill the need, some providers are already using nurse practitioners and physicians\u2019 assistants to pick up the slack by having them take over some duties, such as conducting initial consultations with patients. That probably won\u2019t sit well with patients who expect to see a doctor, not a nurse, to discuss their personal medical issues.\n\nThere are also programs in place requiring recent medical residents to work in New Mexico\u2019s rural communities, but health care experts admit long-term solutions are needed.\n\nTo make things worse, nearly 40 percent of primary care physicians in the state are nearing retirement and there are fears there\u2019s simply not enough young doctors to replace them.\n\n\u201cI think the medical profession is going to have to solve this problem,\u201d John Franchini, the New Mexico Insurance Superintendent, told New Mexico Watchdog. \u201cWe can\u2019t solve it from our end. We can\u2019t demand that doctors don\u2019t retire \u2026 Let (doctors) have more freedom to decide how to do this.\u201d\n\nDr. Deane Waldman, a pediatric cardiologist in Albuquerque and the consumer advocate on the board of the New Mexico health exchange, suggests that hospitals and clinics could be encouraged to expand their hours, but admits that given a finite number of doctors, it will take an array of solutions to make a dent.\n\n\u201cThe answer is, if we just keep doing business as usual we will not accomplish the goal,\u201d Waldman said.\n\nFor now, there are suggestions and theories but not many specific programs to tackle New Mexico\u2019s doctor shortage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not being talked about and kind of being pushed under the rug for now because nobody knows what\u2019s going to happen with (the ACA\u2019s) complexity,\u201d Zerbach said.\n\nHere are excerpts of New Mexico Watchdog\u2019s interview with Zerbach:\n\nContact Rob Nikolewski at rnikolewski@watchdog.org and follow him on Twitter @robnikolewski", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "By Rob Nikolewski \u2502 New Mexico Watchdog SANTA FE \u2013 For years, New Mexico has suffered from a chronic shortage of doctors, especially in the rural communities of the state.
