The plan is to add two more by October, Whiteside said.\n\nIn addition to new personnel, Marillac implemented a variety of other changes since announcing in May its designation as a federally qualified community health center and the receipt of a $704,000 federal grant to assist with its expansion. Perhaps the biggest shift is the range of patients now eligible to receive treatment.\n\n\u201cMarillac has always served people ages 18 to 64,\u201d Whiteside said. \u201cAs a community health center, however, it\u2019s now from birth to death, a much wider scope of practice. That\u2019s a big change.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a different clinic than we used to be,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re moving to what is a much more typical family medicine model where it\u2019s high-volume, high-quality medicine. We live and die now on our visit numbers. We need to see patients to survive.\u201d\n\nRecruiting five family practice doctors to the clinic was no small accomplishment, given the scarcity of these specialists on the Western Slope, said Kay Ramachandran, the clinic\u2019s executive director.\n\n\u201cWe have been successful for three reasons. Number one is John Whiteside \u2014 people want to come and work for him,\u201d Ramachandran said. \u201cThe second is salary and benefits. We did make sure we are competitive in salary and benefits. Finally, widening the scope of practice has attracted people to work here.\u201d\n\nBecause patients new to Medicaid typically see a doctor 3\u00bd times more often than other patients, the clinic must be prepared for 35,000 doctor visits to reach its goal of seeing 10,000 new patients. That will ultimately require a medical staff of 10, Whiteside said.\n\nIf successful in meeting its goals, the clinic will end up treating roughly 25 percent of the 42,000 Mesa County residents who enrolled in Medicaid since the Affordable Care Act took effect, Whiteside said.\n\nNearly as important, meeting those milestones secures for the immediate future Marillac\u2019s continued designation as a federal community health center, which comes with a multitude of benefits for Mesa County residents, he said.\n\nFor example, the expansion helps to ease a financial burden that St. Mary\u2019s Hospital and other health care providers take on when they treat people insured by Medicaid, which normally pays less for medical service than private insurance, said Mike McBride, St. Mary\u2019s president and CEO.\n\n\u201cMarillac plays an incredibly important role,\u201d McBride said.\n\nUnder the new regime, Medicaid is the primary source of payment for Marillac, Whiteside said.\n\nMarillac became an independent entity in order to obtain the community health center designation. That meant establishing a new board of directors comprised of a majority who are Marillac patients, Ramachandran said.\n\nThe new board has been learning how to perform its policy-setting role and also reviewing new written policies the clinic needs to operate, she said.\n\nDesignation as a federally qualified community health center came with a $704,000 grant for 2015, which is helping to pay for the transition.\n\nFor many patients, little will change. Marillac will still charge based on a sliding scale that takes into account the patient\u2019s ability to pay. Patients also will continue going to the clinic offices at 2333 N. Sixth St. and at the Mesa County Health Department.\n\nEventually, though, the new medical staff will settle into place and begin accepting new patients, Ramachandran said.\n\nMarillac also will have to provide the core services required of health centers. It has contracted one of those services, family planning, to the Mesa County Health Department.\n\nThe clinic\u2019s relationship with St. Mary\u2019s Hospital and the Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth continues to be strong and both organizations supported the clinic\u2019s application to be qualified as a health center, McBride said.\n\nSt. Mary\u2019s provides Marillac with many in-kind services, cash and the space it needs to operate \u2014 in all, a value of around $2 million a year from St. Mary\u2019s, McBride said.\n\nMarillac was founded 27 years ago by St. Mary\u2019s in an effort to deliver medical services to uninsured people using volunteer providers. Today, it has its own staff and offers medical, dental and optical services.", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-CO", "DC.format": "text/html", "geo.placename": "Grand Junction", "description": "Grand Junction - With three new doctors expected Sept. 1 and two more the following month, Marillac Clinic has managed to hire five of the 10 medical staff", "geo.position": "39.0500,-108.5500", "DC.description": "Grand Junction - With three new doctors expected Sept. 1 and two more the following month, Marillac Clinic has managed to hire five of the 10 medical staff", "DC.identifier": "http://www.gjsentinel.com/lifestyle/articles/critically-understaffed-marillac-hires-82325-new-d/", "DC.type": "Text", "robots": "index,follow,archive", "DC.publisher": "GJSentinel.com/The Grand Junction Daily Sentinel", "DC.date.valid": "2016-06-01T09:58:03-0600", "DC.creator": "Greg Ruland", "DC.rights": "The Grand Junction Daily Sentinel", "keywords": "Grand Junction Colorado breaking news photography business events sports high school real estate", "DC.date.created": "2015-08-11T05:04:00-0600", "DC.subject": "Grand Junction Colorado breaking news photography business events sports high school real estate", "DC.date.modified": "2015-08-13T08:40:00-0600", "DC.title": "Critically understaffed Marillac hires \u20285 new doctors, expects more to come  |  GJSentinel.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaebb\"", "article_summary": "Critically understaffed Marillac hires 5 new doctors, expects more to comeCritically understaffed Marillac hires 5 new doctors, expects more to comeWith three new doctors expected Sept. 1 and two more the following month, Marillac Clinic has managed to hire five of the 10 medical staff it needs to meet its goal of nearly doubling its patient load to 10,000 before the end of 2016.\nThat meant establishing a new board of directors comprised of a majority who are Marillac patients, Ramachandran said.\nUnder the new regime, Medicaid is the primary source of payment for Marillac, Whiteside said.\n\u201cAs a community health center, however, it\u2019s now from birth to death, a much wider scope of practice.\nMarillac was founded 27 years ago by St. Mary\u2019s in an effort to deliver medical services to uninsured people using volunteer providers."}
