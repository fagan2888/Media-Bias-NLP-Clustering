We had close to 900 voters then.\u201d\n\nA steady stream of voters filed through the Dallas Township polling station behind the municipal building, said George Kebles, a judge of elections for the township.\n\n\u201cWe expect to be busy all day,\u201d Kebles said.\n\nIn Dallas Township there are about 2,500 registered voters, he said. By 9:30 a.m., 200 voters came through the doors, Kebles said.\n\nDallas Township citizens John and Marlene Cacozza came out early to voice their opposition to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, often referred to as Obamacare, by voting.\n\n\u201cObamacare really affected us,\u201d Marlene Cacozza said. \u201cMedicare and Social Security issues are important to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel that (Donald) Trump could make this country strong and unite the country,\u201d John Cacozza said.\n\nDianne Holtje, the judge of elections at Dallas Borough municipal building, said 330 voters came through by 4 p.m. Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt is the largest voter turnout so far for a primary election,\u201d Holtje said.\n\nThe heated presidential race between Republicans Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and John Kasich and Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders has fueled many voters to be outspoken.\n\nCampaign volunteers for state Rep. Karen Boback, R-Harveys Lake, saw a man kick down one of Trump\u2019s campaign signs outside of the polling center at Harveys Lake Borough\u2019s municipal building.\n\nNathan Spagnudo, the judge of elections for the borough, was not aware of the incident outside.\n\nSpagnudo focused on handling the large voter turnout. By 4:30 p.m., the polling location at the borough building had 600 residents come out to vote.\n\n\u201cWe have over 2,000 registered voters,\u201d he said. \u201cAt one point we were averaging about 80 people per hour.\u201d\n\nJack and Jackie Davis of Harveys Lake wore their red, autographed Trump hats into the borough\u2019s polling station.\n\n\u201cWe went to his rally last night (April 25),\u201d Jackie Davis said.\n\n\u201cI like that Trump funded his campaign and does not owe anybody,\u201d Jack Davis said. \u201cThe other candidates will have to pay back.\u201d\n\nThe couple said Trump is different than other career politicians.\n\n\u201cI am tired of government and county bureaucrats,\u201d Jackie said. \u201cI want issues like the economy, veterans\u2019 issues and women\u2019s concerns to go in a better direction.\u201d\n\nSherrie Contardi of Lehman Township was one of 332 voters who turned out to the Lehman Township municipal building before 4 p.m. Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI always vote. I am not thrilled with the presidential choices,\u201d she said. \u201cIt (the presidential candidates) was the last part of the ballot I filled out.\u201d\n\nLehman Township resident, Marty Straub said his decision rests on his ability to sort out which candidate provided a believable message.\n\n\u201cYou have to read between the lines,\u201d Straub said. \u201cThey outline the issues but offer no solutions.\u201d\n\nAccording to unofficial poll results, Clinton took the Democratic contest, and Trump was the selection on the Republican side for Pennsylvania.\n\nReach Eileen Godin at 570-991-6387 or on Twitter @TLNews\n\nReach Eileen Godin at 570-991-6387 or on Twitter @TLNews", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-PA", "DC.rights": "Civitas Media", "geo.placename": "Dallas", "description": "Local News, Sports, Obituaries, and Classifieds for Dallas, PA", "author": "Dallas Post", "og": {"site_name": "Dallas Post", "description": "Poll workers say April 26 primary saw high turnout numbersBy Eileen Godinegodin@timesleader.com\n.neFileBlock {\n\tmargin-bottom: 20px;\n}\n.neFileBlo...", "title": "Primary election draws voters in Back Mountain - Dallas Post - mydallaspost.com", "url": "http://http://mydallaspost.com/uncategorized/16876/primary-election-draws-voters-in-back-mountain", "image": "http://mydallaspost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/web1_Kingston-Twp-vote-1.jpg", "locality": "Dallas", "type": "article", "region": "US-PA"}, "DC.type": "Text", "twitter": {"site": "@mydallaspost", "image": "http://mydallaspost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/web1_Kingston-Twp-vote-1.jpg", "description": "Poll workers say April 26 primary saw high turnout numbersBy Eileen Godinegodin@timesleader.com\n.neFileBlock {\n\tmargin-bottom: 20px;\n}\n.neFileBlo...", "card": "summary", "title": "Primary election draws voters in Back Mountain - Dallas Post - mydallaspost.com"}, "DC.format": "text/html", "DC.contributor": "Dallas Post", "robots": "index, follow", "DC.publisher": "Dallas Post", "DC.identifier": "http://mydallaspost.com", "DC.relation": "http://dublincore.org/", "DC.language": "en_US", "DC.description": "Poll workers say April 26 primary saw high turnout numbersBy Eileen Godinegodin@timesleader.com\n.neFileBlock {\n\tmargin-bottom: 20px;\n}\n.neFileBlo...", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "DC.title": "Dallas Post, Dallas PA - www.mydallaspost.com"}, "article_summary": "http://mydallaspost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/web1_Dallas-Twp-vote-1.jpg By 9:30 a.m. Dallas Township already received 200 voters, according to George Kebles, a judge of elections for the township.\n\u2014 Back Mountain residents hit the polls in greater numbers Tuesday than in previous primary elections, according to several polling site administrators.\nWe had close to 900 voters then.\u201dA steady stream of voters filed through the Dallas Township polling station behind the municipal building, said George Kebles, a judge of elections for the township.\nIn Dallas Township there are about 2,500 registered voters, he said.\nDianne Holtje, the judge of elections at Dallas Borough municipal building, said 330 voters came through by 4 p.m. Tuesday."}
