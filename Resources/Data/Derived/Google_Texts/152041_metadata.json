Boeing employees in Seattle recently rejected a contract from the airplane manufacturer.\n\n\"If an elected official was truly committed to the interests of working people as a genuine socialist would be, then, if I were him, I would prioritize meeting Boeing workers and trying to ensure that I gave them my support and solidarity,\" she said. \"I wouldn\u2019t be going to raise millions of dollars from wealthy backers.\"\n\nView Sawant's entire response in the video above from HuffPost Live.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: 11 Paranoid Obama Conspiracy Theories 11 Paranoid Obama Conspiracy Theories\n\n1 of 11 Obama Is Not An American Citizen Lou Dobbs, One of the most popular Obama conspiracy theories (aka the Birther Movement), endorsed (or not denied) by the likes of Tom Delay Chuck Norris and Liz Cheney , it claims that Obama is not an American citizen, thus rendering his presidency illegitimate, or something.
