The Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides new health insurance coverage opportunities and extends non-discrimination protections to millions of individuals, including people with HIV. Greater access to insurance coverage has the potential to improve continuous access to care and treatment for people with HIV which can positively impact individual health outcomes and reduced the risk of HIV transmission., Therefore, as the major coverage reforms under the ACA are implemented, it is important to monitor how people with HIV are impacted. To provide greater insight into what the ACA has meant for this population, focus groups were conducted with HIV positive individuals in five states – California, Florida, Georgia, New York, and Texas – in the Summer and Fall of 2014. These groups provided an early look at how people with HIV were experiencing care under the ACA. As a follow-up, this report provides a second look at how the ACA is impacting people with HIV two years into these new coverage opportunities, based on focus groups conducted with HIV positive individuals from the same states in early 2016, after the third round of open enrollment. Groups were conducted with HIV positive individuals who gained insurance coverage – through either the Marketplaces or Medicaid expansion- in California and New York and with those who remained uninsured, largely because they fell into the coverage gap, in Florida, Georgia, and Texas.
