In the latest installment, instead of distancing Univison\u2019s news division from the ObamaCare marketing machine, now the tie-in could not be more direct, as the new ObamaCare ad features none other than network\u2019s chief medical correspondent, Dr. Juan Rivera.\n\n\u201cWe want you to enroll now. Insure yourself,\u201d Dr. Rivera exhorts viewers in the new ad [see video after the page break.] Unlike Univision's previous ObamaCare enrollments ads, which featured network morning show talent, Dr. Rivera is a regular fixture in Univision's news programming.\n\nUnivision\u2019s current and previous ObamaCare enrollment ads are a product of the Spanish-language television network\u2019s high-profile, lucrative partnership with the Obama administration in promoting ObamaCare.\n\nThe California Endowment, whose logo appears in the ad, serves as a financial funnel for this partnership, and last year signed a $20 million deal with Univision for its \u201cmulti-platform\u201d ObamaCare enrollment campaign, as reported by Kaiser Health News. It has yet to be revealed whether or not the new ad series is tied to a fresh multi-million dollar deal between the two organizations.\n\nPartiality in Univision\u2019s news coverage of ObamaCare has been a chronic problem at the network, as documented by the Media Research Center's landmark April 2014 study Hispanic Media in the Balance. The content analysis of the network\u2019s flagship news program, Noticiero Univision, found that over the course of four months, liberal advocates of ObamaCare were cited nearly five times as often as conservative opponents of ObamaCare.\n\nUnivision\u2019s news coverage of ObamaCare has been frequently bracketed by promotional tie-ins and commercials, such as this latest one, shown below.\n\nDespite the untold millions of dollars spent to foist ObamaCare upon the population, polls show it is opposed by a large segment of the nation\u2019s Hispanics. A Pew Research Center poll in March of 2014 found Hispanics in the U.S. evenly divided (at 47%) between those who support and oppose it. Similarly, a Kaiser Family Foundation poll last month found that 53% of Americans overall have an unfavorable opinion of ObamaCare.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NewsBusters", "description": "Univision is out with a new ad series promoting ObamaCare enrollment.
