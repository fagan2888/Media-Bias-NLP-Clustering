Fifteen members of the Ramapough Lenape tribe are suing the makers of the film Out of the Furnace because they feel it is an obvious and malicious attack on their people. As previously reported, the Ramapough believe that the gang of corrupt hilbillies who serve as the film's antagonists is based on a negative stereotype of the tribe.

Eight of the plaintiffs share the last name, DeGroat, of Woody Harrelson's villainous character. Another plaintiff's last name is Van Dunk, which is also in the film. In the movie, the gang is referred to as the "Jackson Whites," which, according to the suit, is well-known among locals as a derogatory term for the Ramapough.

"Any reasonable person would be offended by the false light in which the movie placed the people who have the family name of DeGroat and Van Dunk and who are known to live in the Ramapo Mountains and/or be part of the group now or formerly known as Jackson Whites," the suit alleges, according to a CNN report.
