Both conservatives and liberals opposed the bill, though for different reasons.\n\nThe House successfully passed an almost identical bill in 2013, but parents and grassroots conservative groups who have been actively fighting against the Common Core standards in their states claimed HR5 would still require excessive amounts of federal intrusion into education, an area that is reserved to the states and localities in the U.S. Constitution.\n\nRep. Justin Amash (R-MI), who opposed HR5, tweeted:\n\nCONFIRMED: Reauthorization of #NoChildLeftBehind (#HR5) has been pulled from consideration. Your calls, emails & tweets made a difference! \u2014 Justin Amash (@repjustinamash) February 27, 2015\n\nAccording to Politico, political contention over funding for the Department of Homeland Security \u201ccomplicated\u201d the debate over HR5.\n\nNevertheless, the Student Success Act lacked support. Both the conservative Heritage Foundation and the Club for Growth opposed the bill.\n\nHouse leaders attempted to sweeten the deal for conservatives by including amendments, including one that would have prohibited school-based health centers from distributing information about abortion as part of sex education.\n\nDemocrats too were highly critical of the bill. As Breitbart News reported on Wednesday, President Obama threatened to veto the bill if passed, claiming it \u201cabdicates the historic federal role in elementary and secondary education of ensuring the education progress of all of America\u2019s students, including students from low-income families, students with disabilities, English learners and students of color.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration used waivers to NCLB\u2019s onerous regulations to entice states into adopting \u201ccommon,\u201d uniform standards, aligned testing, teacher evaluation programs, and student data collection systems.\n\nSen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), head of the Senate\u2019s education committee, and ranking member Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) are reportedly working together on a \u201cbipartisan bill that they hope can clear the chamber,\u201d and be signed into law by President Obama, reports Politico.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making good progress,\u201d Alexander reportedly said. \u201cI\u2019m very pleased with the way we\u2019re working with Sen. Murray right now.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Republicans Pull NCLB Reauthorization From House Floor", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "House Republicans Pull NCLB Reauthorization From House Floor", "title": "House Republicans Pull NCLB Reauthorization From House Floor - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/this-weeks-common-core-standards-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/02/27/house-republicans-pull-nclb-reauthorization-from-house-floor/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "House Republicans Pull NCLB Reauthorization From House Floor", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/this-weeks-common-core-standards-AP.jpg", "title": "House Republicans Pull NCLB Reauthorization From House Floor - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Common Core, federal overreach, House Republicans, No Child Left Behind, Rep.
