It came through thick and thin.\u201d\n\nFederal prosecutors have decided not to charge a neighborhood watch volunteer, George Zimmerman, with a hate crime for killing Martin in Florida three years ago. The boy\u2019s mother, Sybrina Fulton, said she believes Mr. Zimmerman got away with murder.\n\n\u201cHe took a life, carelessly and recklessly, and he shouldn\u2019t deserve to have his entire life walking around on the street free. I just believe that he should be held accountable for what he\u2019s done,\u201d she told The Associated Press.\n\nMr. Obama said civil rights progress in America \u201chappens only because seemingly ordinary people find the courage to stand up for what is right, not just when it\u2019s easy but when it\u2019s hard.\u201d\n\nHe said the nation doesn\u2019t set aside Black History Month to \u201cisolate\u201d or \u201csegregate\u201d that history, but to \u201cilluminate\u201d it.\n\nThe president will travel next week to Selma, Alabama, to mark the anniversary of the bloody confrontation between civil-rights marchers and police in 1965 that was a turning point in the movement and led to the Voting Rights Act.\n\n\u201cWhat happened in Selma is quintessentially an American experience, not just an African-American experience,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIt speaks to what\u2019s best in this country.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "At a reception to celebrate Black History Month, President Obama noted the third anniversary of the shooting death of Trayvon Martin and offered condolences to the teen's parents, who were guests in the audience at the White House.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "At a reception to celebrate Black History Month, President Obama noted the third anniversary of the shooting death of Trayvon Martin and offered condolences to the teen\u2019s parents, who were guests in the audience at the White House.", "title": "Obama cites Trayvon Martin at black history reception", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/26/obama-cites-trayvon-martin-black-history-reception/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/26/Obama_Black_History_Month.JPEG-0c7ac.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/26/Obama_Black_History_Month.JPEG-0c7ac.jpg", "description": "At a reception to celebrate Black History Month, President Obama noted the third anniversary of the shooting death of Trayvon Martin and offered condolences to the teen's parents, who were guests in t", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama cites Trayvon Martin at black history reception"}, "Author": "Dave Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues, Trayvon Martin, George Zimmerman"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc995b\"", "article_summary": "At a reception to celebrate Black History Month, President Obama noted the third anniversary of the shooting death of Trayvon Martin and offered condolences to the teen\u2019s parents, who were guests in the audience at the White House.\n\u201cWhat happened in Selma is quintessentially an American experience, not just an African-American experience,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\nI just believe that he should be held accountable for what he\u2019s done,\u201d she told The Associated Press.\n\u201cHe took a life, carelessly and recklessly, and he shouldn\u2019t deserve to have his entire life walking around on the street free.\nIt came through thick and thin.\u201dFederal prosecutors have decided not to charge a neighborhood watch volunteer, George Zimmerman, with a hate crime for killing Martin in Florida three years ago."}
