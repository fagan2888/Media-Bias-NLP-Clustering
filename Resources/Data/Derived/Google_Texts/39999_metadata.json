You\u2019ve disappointed John Kasich.\n\nIn a Wednesday interview with The Washington Post, Kasich \u2014 continuing his sad presidential campaign\u2019s efforts to equate Ted Cruz with Donald Trump \u2014 whined about being one of few Republicans who cares about ideas.\n\n\u201cSee, I am a fundamental believer in ideas,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have ideas, you got nothing. And frankly, my Republican Party doesn\u2019t like ideas. They want to be negative against things.\u201d\n\nEvery word of this is trademark John Weaver, the sometime Democrat consultant running Kasich\u2019s campaign. Within a few hours, lefty opinion columnists were using Kasich\u2019s words against other Republicans.\n\nSmearing conservatives as Trumpian cranks is hardly a fresh idea; ask the scolds at No Labels or Republican Main Street Partnership. But Weaver seems to think it\u2019s enough to keep the retainer checks coming for a few more months.\n\n\u201cAnd if you look at Ohio, you know, we have so many ideas, new ideas, newfangled ideas in Ohio it\u2019s unbelievable, and they\u2019re paying off,\u201d Kasich continued. Since he brought it up, let\u2019s consider some of the ideas Kasich has put forth in his five years as governor of Ohio.\n\nFirst things first: Kasich supports Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion, a newfangled Democrat idea that has put 670,000 able-bodied, working-age Ohioans on welfare at a cost of $7.5 billion in new federal spending.\n\nKasich would make a great case study in why the national debt is $19 trillion \u2014 he ran for governor as a die-hard fiscal conservative in 2010, and today he\u2019s running for president as a huggable Republican who won\u2019t take away your free stuff.\n\nStates can save federal taxpayers billions by refusing to expand Medicaid. Kasich is governor of a state with Republican legislative supermajorities. But, jeez-oh-man, it wouldn\u2019t be nice to be against Obamacare expansion just \u2019cause it\u2019s awful policy.\n\nKasich vetoed a legislative ban on Obamacare expansion before expanding Medicaid unilaterally and threatening to bankrupt Ohio\u2019s entire Medicaid program if Obamacare funding was not appropriated. He warned critics their opposition could result in eternal damnation.\n\nEverywhere he goes, Kasich brags about how bravely he embraced Obamacare like the media, Chamber of Commerce, Obama administration, hospital lobby, and unions wanted him to; he\u2019s now openly campaigning against its repeal.\n\nObamacare isn\u2019t the only idea Ohio Republicans have disappointed Kasich by fighting against: he\u2019s insistent that the state keep \u201cgreen energy\u201d mandates in place, he wants to tax e-cigarette shops out of business, and he\u2019s been trying to hike fracking taxes since 2012.\n\nKasich plays dumb on Common Core \u2014 which Ohio signed on to under his Democrat predecessor \u2014 and claims to support local control of education, but he opposes a bill to let school districts choose standards other than Common Core.\n\nKasich says he\u2019s for a radical simplification of the tax code and would reduce the federal income tax system to three brackets, but Ohio still has nine income tax brackets and one of the worst municipal tax regimes on Earth.\n\nFinally, try this on for size: Kasich was endorsed by several labor unions in 2014 because he and his legislative allies have smothered any attempt at labor reform since losing a 2011 referendum on a massive public-sector union bill.\n\nJohn Kasich, idea man, is the only Republican governor of a state with a Republican legislature and no right-to-work law stopping unions from taking forced dues from workers. Of the four states that have passed right-to-work since Kasich took office, three \u2014 Indiana, Michigan, and West Virginia \u2014 border Ohio.\n\nA bill to protect Ohioans in the private sector from forced union dues is going nowhere because Kasich is against it, and public-sector right-to-work is a nonstarter for the same reason.\n\nLest you think Kasich is right to cower in fear of Big Labor, here\u2019s the single section of state law that would have to change to free all public employees in Ohio from mandatory union fees.\n\nHow\u2019s this for an idea? Strike the first three paragraphs of Ohio Revised Code 4117.09(C), and revise the final paragraph to read:\n\nNo public employer shall agree to a provision requiring that a public employee become a member of an employee organization or pay any form of fee, fine, or surcharge to an employee organization as a condition for securing or retaining employment.\n\nThis simple reform would save thousands of teachers and other government workers hundreds of dollars per year in forced union dues. It could be explained in layman\u2019s terms in about 15 seconds, and could easily be improved upon to end forced union representation, too.\n\nNot only has Gov. Kasich failed to champion worker freedom and other free-market policies, he actively works against them. Kasich\u2019s problem with other Republicans isn\u2019t their rejection of ideas, but their rejection of his ideas.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Republicans make Kasich sad", "title": "John Kasich wishes more Republicans liked Democrats\u2019 ideas", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2016/04/22/john-kasich-wishes-more-republicans-liked-democrats-ideas/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@EdMorrissey"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-22T12:41:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T17:04:59+00:00"}, "keywords": "2016 presidential race, John Kasich, right to work,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "John Kasich wishes more Republicans liked Democrats\u2019 ideasposted at 8:41 am on April 22, 2016 by Jason HartNow you\u2019ve done it, Republicans.\n\u201cSee, I am a fundamental believer in ideas,\u201d Kasich said.\n\u201cAnd if you look at Ohio, you know, we have so many ideas, new ideas, newfangled ideas in Ohio it\u2019s unbelievable, and they\u2019re paying off,\u201d Kasich continued.\nSince he brought it up, let\u2019s consider some of the ideas Kasich has put forth in his five years as governor of Ohio.\nKasich\u2019s problem with other Republicans isn\u2019t their rejection of ideas, but their rejection of his ideas."}
