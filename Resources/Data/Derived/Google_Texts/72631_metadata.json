Although it did not focus on proposed mergers by Aetna and Humana and Anthem and Cigna -- (a hearing in the committee later this month will focus exclusively on that) \u2013 it provided the first opportunity for opponents of the mergers, including the American Hospital Association and the American Medical Association, to officially register complaints.\n\n\"Those deals appear motivated by top line profits,\" said Rick Pollack, president and CEO of the American Hospital Association, in written testimony. \"The market concentration threatened by the pending insurance deals is large and durable, and consumers and providers are at risk if the deals are allowed to move forward. The two deals promise fewer choices for consumers for commercial insurance and Medicare Advantage plans, narrower networks of providers in what few choices remain and higher premiums and out of market cost, among other things.\"\n\nThomas Greaney, director of the Center for Health Law Studies at St. Louis University said \"evidence of the effect of market concentration in commercial insurance markets, although not as robust as for hospital markets, also indicates that insurance mergers have led to higher premiums for consumers.\"\n\n\"Retrospective studies of health insurance mergers have found significant price increases following consolidation,\" Greaney said.\n\nAetna has struck a deal to buy Humana for $37 billion, which would cover 33 million members. Anthem, a Blue Cross and Blue Shield insurer, wants to buy all of Cigna's shares in a cash and stock transaction that would cost $54 billion and cover 53 million members.\n\nThe future of both deals is now in the hands of the Justice Department's anti-trust division and the Federal Trade Commission. Those regulators face a complex review process given the size of the insurers and the markets they serve.\n\nThe insurers involved in the mergers, backed by the American Health Insurance Plans, a health insurer association, say the mergers will result in better health care quality and lower costs.\n\n\"Together, Anthem and Cigna, who have limited overlap in a highly competitive industry, will be in a better position to improve consumer choice and quality,\" Anthem said in a statement. \" Most of all, we will be better able to lead the transition to value-based care that will reduce costs while improving health outcomes.\"\n\nBut the American Medical Association released a report this week that said the pending insurance deals would drastically lessen consumer health plan choices in 154 metropolitan areas within 23 states.\n\nThe report also said the proposed Anthem-Cigna merger \"would diminish competition in up to 111 metropolitan areas within all 14 states that Anthem currently operates,\" including Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire and New York.\n\nAHIP counters that the AMA study is \"fatally flawed.\"\n\n\"Once again, the AMA is recycling misleading data that does not accurately reflect the market today,\" said AHIP spokeswoman Clare Krusing. \"This latest analysis derives from the same fatally flawed study that has consistently been debunked by leading health care economists. Families and employers in every state have multiple choices of both insurance plans and types of coverage.\"\n\nNevertheless, opposition to the mergers is mounting.\n\n\"We commend today's hearing and other efforts by Congress and federal regulators to conduct a thorough examination of the significant consolidation occurring in the health care marketplace, perhaps most notably the proposed Anthem-Cigna and Aetna-Humana mergers,\" the National Community Pharmacists Association said in a statement released Thursday. \"Policymakers cannot allow the 'merger mania' gripping the nation to proceed in a way that harms patients and the community pharmacists who serve them.\"\n\nMerging with Humana would give Aetna more than one-quarter of the total Medicare Advantage market, analysts say.\n\nAt the Judiciary Committee's hearing, Barbara L. McAneny, a member of the AMA's Board of Trustees, said there are \"fewer and fewer\" Medicaid Advantage plans.\n\nMcAneny said she's seen consolidation result in plans \"where (a patient's) primary care doctor is on one plan and the specialist is on another.\"\n\nGoodlatte said he wanted to \"sound the siren on Obamacare's anti-competitive practices.\"\n\nRepublicans like Goodlatte say the ACA places so many burdens and new costs on the healthcare industry that mergers are necessary for them to survive economically.\n\nBut witness Greaney of the Center for Health Law Studies at St. Louis University said consolidation in the health care field has been on the march long before passage of the ACA.\n\n\"Nothing in the ACA encourages consolidation,\" he said.\n\nGreaney was also skeptical that any benefits would come to consumers through consolidation, calling those arguments by \"big insurers and big hospitals\" the \"sumo wrestling theory.\"\n\nTo help fight back against critics and win federal approval of its merger with Humana, Aetna has recently hired four high-powered Washington lobbying firms. Cigna has also beefed up its lobbyist in Washington, hiring three new D.C. lobbying firms to press its case to merge with Anthem.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Congress Scrutinizes Aetna-Humana And Anthem-Cigna Deals", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The CT Mirror", "author": "The CT Mirror", "og": {"site_name": "courant.com", "description": "WASHINGTON, DC \u2014 Congressional Republicans are blaming the Affordable Care Act for a wave of mergers and consolidations by hospitals, pharmaceuticals and insurers, which, they say, are costing consumers money and choice.", "title": "Congress Scrutinizes Aetna-Humana And Anthem-Cigna Deals", "url": "http://www.courant.com/business/hc-ctm-congress-health-insurance-mergers-20150910-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5418224f/turbine/hc-hartford-default-fb-icon", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp02.14", "twitter": {"site": "@hartfordcourant", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Congressional hearings Aetna Cigna Anthem Humana mergers", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=391113483, app-argument=http://www.courant.com/deeplinkid/84403096", "fb": {"admins": 14500562, "page_id": 49693986601, "app_id": 152391743139}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-09-10", "Description": "That new interest in consolidation in the health care field is bringing unwanted political attention on the proposed Aetna-Humana and Anthem-Cigna mergers, which came under congressional scrutiny Thursday.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Congressional hearings Aetna Cigna Anthem Humana mergers"}, "article_summary": "\"The market concentration threatened by the pending insurance deals is large and durable, and consumers and providers are at risk if the deals are allowed to move forward.\n\"This latest analysis derives from the same fatally flawed study that has consistently been debunked by leading health care economists.\nThat new interest in consolidation in the health care field is bringing unwanted political attention on the proposed Aetna-Humana and Anthem-Cigna mergers, which came under congressional scrutiny Thursday.\n\"Retrospective studies of health insurance mergers have found significant price increases following consolidation,\" Greaney said.\n\"Those deals appear motivated by top line profits,\" said Rick Pollack, president and CEO of the American Hospital Association, in written testimony."}
