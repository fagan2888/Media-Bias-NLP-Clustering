Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens) authored the bill, SB 4, known as the Health for All Act, to extend health coverage because unauthorized immigrants are not eligible to buy insurance under the Affordable Care Act. If it is approved, California would become the first state to offer health insurance to those in the country without permission.\n\nInitially the bill was more expansive, offering state subsidized insurance to all immigrants here illegally, but it was scaled back to address concerns about cost. According to the Public Policy Institute of California there are about 2.6 million unauthorized immigrants in the state - more than half live in Southern California. Experts estimate more than 1 million unauthorized immigrants are uninsured.\n\nThe bill the Senate approved was amended last week and has three main provisions:\n\nAllows those in the U.S. illegally to purchase unsubsidized health insurance through Covered California if the federal government grants permission;\n\nProvides access to Medi-Cal for those 19 and under regardless of immigration status;\n\nExtends Medi-Cal access to adults over 19 regardless of immigration, if funding is available.\n\nLara called the vote a \"decisive step forward\"\n\n\"Providing quality health care to hundreds of thousands of kids in California will be transformational to thousands of families,\" Lara said about the bill. \"Ensuring every kid in California grows up healthy with an opportunity to thrive and succeed is the right thing to do.\"\n\nThe estimated annual cost of the bill ranges from $280 million to as high as $740 million. The range is so wide because of the federal programs that may allow some unauthorized immigrants to get temporary legal status, which would make them eligible for Medi-Cal.\n\nCommunity activists are optimistic about the future of the bill.\n\n\u201cThe future of California depends on all children and their families having access to the quality health coverage and care they need to survive and thrive,\" said Alex Johnson, executive director of the Children's Defense Fund.\n\nOpponents of the bill argue it will overburden the state financially at a time when the budget is already stretched and they worry access to health insurance would serve as a beacon for future waves of unauthorized immigration to the state.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"author": "Southern California Public Radio", "og": {"site_name": "Southern California Public Radio", "description": "SB 4 would let some unauthorized immigrants get Medi-Cal, and would seek a federal waiver to let them buy unsubsidized insurance through Covered California.", "title": "CA Senate approves health bill for immigrants in US illegally", "url": "http://www.scpr.org/news/2015/06/02/52140/calif-senate-passes-health-care-bill-for-those-in/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://a.scpr.org/i/154ebe559ec046e0965433207418b8c7/78257-full.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 768}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://scpr.org", "description": "Member-supported public radio for Southern California.
