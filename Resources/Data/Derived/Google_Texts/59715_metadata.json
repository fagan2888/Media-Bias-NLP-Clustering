Everybody knows that, right? But did you know that lots of other part-time gigs also include company-sponsored health benefits?\n\nIn 2014 the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported nearly 1 in 4 (23%) of part-time private-sector workers got medical care benefits, notes Joe Weinlick, senior vice president of marketing for career network Beyond. Full-timers did better -- 86% of them had employer-sponsored medical benefits -- but it\u2019s clear that part-time with benefits is no pipe dream.\n\n\n\n\u201cMany companies offer benefits, even to those with a part-time schedule,\u201d Weinlick says.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for part-time work with benefits, the bigger the employer, the better.\n\n\n\n\u201cLarger companies are more likely to offer benefits, and have more employees,\u201d Weinlick says. And be prepared to compromise. Employers who do insure part-timers generally offer them lower-quality plans than full-timers get. You may have to pay more of the monthly premium, get fewer benefits, or both, compared to full-timers.\n\nEmployers usually require part-timers to work at least 20 hours a week to earn benefits, although it may be up to 30 hours. You also may have to work there for a while -- a three- to six-month probationary period is common -- before benefits kick in.\n\nIf you can\u2019t find a part-time job with benefits, wait a while and try again.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are a number of trends that are causing more companies to offer part-time benefits,\u201d Weinlick says. In a job market increasingly tilting toward employees, employers are looking to improved benefits as a tool to attract and keep talented workers. \u201cIn addition, more companies are making social responsibility a brand tenet,\u201d Weinlick adds. \u201cThat responsibility starts at home, by treating employees well.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"layout": "main", "description": "Did you know that lots of other part-time gigs also include company-sponsored health benefits?", "author": "Mark Henricks", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "Did you know that lots of other part-time gigs also include company-sponsored health benefits?", "title": "Part-Time Jobs With Benefits: Limited-Hours With Health Plans (But No Coffee)", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/part-time-jobs-with-benefits-limited-hours-with-health-plans-but-no-coffee", "image": {"width": 600, "secure_url": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/employeebenefits1209.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/employeebenefits1209.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Financial Planning", "keywords": "personal finance, part-time jobs with benefits, workplace dynamics, health insurance, obamacare", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Financial Planning", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2015-03-18T15:04Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/1610768"}, "date": "2015-03-18T15:04Z", "contentType": "article", "guid": 13083636, "twitter": {"description": "Did you know that lots of other part-time gigs also include company-sponsored health benefits?", "title": "Part-Time Jobs With Benefits: Limited-Hours With Health Plans (But No Coffee)", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/part-time-jobs-with-benefits-limited-hours-with-health-plans-but-no-coffee", "image": {"src": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/employeebenefits1209.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/employeebenefits1209.jpg"}, "site": "@mainstr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "personal finance, part-time jobs with benefits, workplace dynamics, health insurance, obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce3bc\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThere are a number of trends that are causing more companies to offer part-time benefits,\u201d Weinlick says.\nFull-timers did better -- 86% of them had employer-sponsored medical benefits -- but it\u2019s clear that part-time with benefits is no pipe dream.\n\u201cMany companies offer benefits, even to those with a part-time schedule,\u201d Weinlick says.\nIf you\u2019re looking for part-time work with benefits, the bigger the employer, the better.\nIf you can\u2019t find a part-time job with benefits, wait a while and try again."}
