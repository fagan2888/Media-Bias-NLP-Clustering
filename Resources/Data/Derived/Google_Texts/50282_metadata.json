When you\u2019re feeling fine, it\u2019s hard to pencil it in. And it\u2019s even more tempting to skip the appointment if you\u2019re young, in the earliest stages of your career (i.e. not making that much money) and maybe don\u2019t have the best insurance or perhaps any insurance at all.\n\nOne of the most popular provisions of The Affordable Care Act was aimed at solving these issues by allowing young adults to stay on their parents\u2019 insurance plans until age 26. But after the ACA was signed into law in 2010, there was only a 3.7% increase in the number of young adults (aged 18 to 25) getting routine exams and screenings in 2011, according to a new study in the journal JAMA Pediatrics. It\u2019s a small bump, but a promising one, says Josephine Lau, MD, a pediatrician at UCSF Benioff Children\u2019s Hospital in San Francisco: \u201cI think if we were to repeat the study for 2012, 2013, and 2014, we would find further increases.\u201d\n\nRELATED: 19 Medical Tests Everyone Needs\n\nWhile it\u2019s great that millennials are now covered if they do get sick, we wanted to know: Do young, healthy women really need to see a doctor every year for a check-up? Especially considering that even for older (but still healthy) adults, the yearly physical seems to have fallen out of favor in many expert circles. Even Lau admits that for anyone over 21, it\u2019s unclear how beneficial an annual physical is in the long-term, but that skipping your primary care doctor completely is definitely not a good idea.\n\nHere are three important things young, healthy women miss out on when they stay away from the examination table:\n\nA relationship\n\nIf you\u2019re not going to get a yearly check-up, chances are you don\u2019t have someone to see when you do get sick. Sure, you can rely on walk-in clinics if you pick up strep, get a wicked urinary tract infection, or jam your finger, but that convenience often comes with a cost. What happens when your UTI becomes a pattern? If you\u2019re seeing a different doctor every time, the next one you see may not realize that you\u2019ve already had that certain antibiotic twice and another pill might work better. \u201cYou have to start from scratch every time something\u2019s wrong,\u201d Lau says. \u201cIf you have your own doctor, there is continuity: He or she knows your history, and your family history, and may be able to provide better quality care.\u201d\n\nRELATED: 27 Mistakes Healthy People Make\n\nPlus, many practices now offer patient portals, secure web-based systems that allow you to communicate via e-mail. \u201cIf you have a relationship with your doctor, you can ask questions or request a medication refill, and you don\u2019t even have to pick up the phone.\u201d\n\nShots\n\nIn their study, Lau and her colleagues found that the 18- to 25-year-old group is still avoiding the annual flu shot, which is preventive health 101. But there are also a few other shots healthy adult women need to consider, from the tetanus booster to possibly a varicella vaccine, which protects you from chicken pox. Many people don\u2019t have their vaccination records on hand, but your doctor counsel you on boosters you\u2019re likely due for as well as what to get if you\u2019re traveling. As vaccine-preventable diseases continue to make a comeback, this is worth a conversation, at least.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t been vaccinated against human papillomavirus (HPV) yet, talk to your doc about the shots (a series of three doses administered over six months). The vaccine\u2014which protects against the types of HPV that cause most cases of cervical cancer\u2014is recommended for teen girls and women under the age of 26.\n\nRELATED: Adult Vaccines: What You Need and When\n\nGood advice\n\n\u201cEven though young people are less likely to have a chronic illness, it doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t engaging in activities that put them at risk for disease,\u201d says Lau.\n\nWorking long hours, unhealthy eating, drinking too much, not sleeping enough\u2014these behaviors may not seem like a big deal now, but they do damage over time. Primary care providers, who are trained in treating the entire patient (physically, mentally, and emotionally), can provide counseling on lifestyle changes\u2014and refer you to specialists if say, it turns out your semi-frequent headaches aren\u2019t getting better with more sleep and less booze.\n\nThe bottom line, Lau says: \u201cMake an appointment to see your doctor once, get your screenings done, and then decide with your provider when to come back.\u201d\n\nRELATED: 6 Key Medical Scans And What They Should Cost", "article_metadata": {"Content-Source": "healthcom", "description": "Here are three important things young, healthy women miss out on when they stay away from the examination table.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Health News / Tips & Trends / Celebrity Health", "description": "Here are three important things young, healthy women miss out on when they stay away from the examination table.", "title": "3 Reasons Why Young, Healthy Women Should Go for a Check-Up", "url": "http://news.health.com/2014/11/11/3-reasons-why-young-healthy-women-should-go-for-a-check-up/", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "https://healthnewsandviews.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/why-you-should-get-a-checkup.jpg", "height": 347}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://healthnewsandviews.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/why-you-should-get-a-checkup.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@goodhealth", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "search_title": "3 Reasons Why Young, Healthy Women Should Go for a Check-Up", "msapplication-tooltip": "Health's blog features breaking news, celebrity tips, exercise videos, and more!
