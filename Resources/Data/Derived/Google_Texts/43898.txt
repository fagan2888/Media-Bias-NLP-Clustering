Late night comedy host Jimmy Kimmel released a mock commercial Monday night poking fun at the new company selected to repair the glitch-ridden healthcare.gov website.

“The Obama Administration hired the company Accenture to fix their troubled healthcare website,” a YouTube description of Kimmel’s mock ad says. “Judging by this commercial they might be just the right company to get the job done. They have a reputation for EXACTLY this kind of work.”

The video, which has just under 10,000 views on YouTube, features a narrator explaining how the company is great at “getting s*** un****d.”

“Building applications for today’s highly distributed network computing environments can be a challenge.” Share:

“Building applications for today’s highly distributed network computing environments can be a challenge. It’s easy to f*** things up,” the ad’s narrator says. “And when things get f***ed up, Accenture can help you get them unf***ed.”
