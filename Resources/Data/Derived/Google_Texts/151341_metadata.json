Their lease was up for renewal and the rent increased from $5,000 a month to $25,000.\n\nSuch an enormous jump isn\u2019t unusual here in the West Village, part of Greenwich Village in lower Manhattan, which has become such an expensive and trendy part of the city that I may soon be kicked out both for violating the fashion code and skewing the curve on median income.\n\nThe restaurant owner, who had run his place for three decades, was remarkably calm about it. \u201cI understand,\u201d he told the dining blog, Eater. \u201cThe property values are really high in this area.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an understatement. Much of Bleecker Street, for example, once a Village thoroughfare of bohemia immortalized in songs by Joni Mitchell, Bruce Springsteen and Iggy Pop, is now a mini-Fifth Avenueof upscale boutiques and chain stores from the likes of Marc Jacobs, Michael Kors, Ralph Lauren, Brooks Brothers and Coach. Gone are most of the delis and funky, mom-and-pop shops that gave the area its distinctive style.\n\nGone, too, are many of the community services that make a neighborhood a neighborhood, replaced by expensive housing and other amenities for the rich whose desires are obliterating the very things that made this area an attractive place to live in the first place. Just a block north from that now-shuttered Chinese restaurant is the former site of St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital, founded in 1849 by the Sisters of Charity, a Catholic teaching hospital that over the years treated everyone, rich or poor, and everything from cholera to AIDS (it was a pioneer in HIV-AIDS care). Survivors from the Titanic and the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire were brought there, and on 9/11, its medical staff waited patiently for casualties.\n\nBut five and a half years ago, St. Vincent\u2019s flatlined and closed, awash in bankruptcy and whispers of alleged collusion with developers eager to get their hands on some prime real estate. The New York Post even reported, in 2011, that the Manhattan district attorney was investigating \u201cwhether honchos purposely tanked its finances so it could be sold.\u201d Nothing ever came of the story or the rumors and now, rising in on land where healing and compassion were once the be all and end all, are grand luxury condominiums.\n\nThis weekend, The New York Times reported that the first two condos had been sold: \u201cAn eighth-floor unit went for $19,528,202.36 and was the most expensive closed sale of the week, while another, four floors below, sold for $16,320,623.57.\u201d\n\nIn each case, the buyers are anonymous. The Times continued, \u201cThe pricier of the sold apartments\u2026 has four bedrooms and four and a half baths spread over 4,537 square feet. The unit, with monthly carrying costs totaling $15,800, also has a library with a fireplace, a home office, a large utility room with a washer/dryer and a centrally located gallery. There is an open living/dining area with beamed ceilings, dark-stained herringbone floors and custom wood trim.\u201d\n\nAccording to the development\u2019s website, \u201cThese handsome spaces bring to mind the cachet of an Old World private club.\u201d No doubt the kind where Gilded Age tycoons like Carnegie, Morgan, Vanderbilt and Whitney escaped the madding crowd and from the windows flicked their cigar ash at worker bees and slum dwellers.\n\nSo there goes the neighborhood. These new apartments next door to the empty Chinese restaurant are what economists call \u201clocal indicators,\u201d further proof that the one percent would prefer the rest of us to vanish into the woodwork \u2013 excuse me, the \u201ccustom wood trim.\u201d As colleague Bill Moyers reported a year ago onMoyers & Company, \u201cAmong our largest, richest 20 metro areas, less than 50 percent of the homes are affordable.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jane Jacobs' worst fears are slowly being realized.
