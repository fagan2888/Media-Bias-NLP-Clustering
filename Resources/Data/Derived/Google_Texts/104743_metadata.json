Monday Jan. 6, 2014 where he was a guest. (AP Photo/The Independent, Kevin Goldy) (Kevin Goldy/AP)\n\nThe jabs at Mitch McConnell have been coming on the air and in the mail, accusing the Senate Republican leader of helping President Obama and letting down Kentucky voters.\n\nThe attacks are not the work of McConnell\u2019s conservative primary challenger. Instead, they are coming from independent groups that want to unseat him and are benefitting from a new system of unlimited contributions ushered in by the Supreme Court in its 2010 Citizens United v. FEC ruling.\n\nConservatives cheered that decision, described at the time by McConnell as a \u201cFirst Amendment triumph.\u201d But, as McConnell\u2019s experience now illustrates, the loosened rules are causing political headaches for the GOP \u2014 allowing tea party groups to bring more financial firepower to challenges against Republican incumbents.\n\nNow, party leaders struggling to unify the warring wings in time to retake the Senate this year and lay a foundation for the 2016 presidential race are instead contending with a well-financed insurgency.\n\nRepublicans are now far more likely than Democrats to field attacks by independent groups in their primaries. In 2012, super PACs and nonprofit groups reported spending nearly $36 million in GOP congressional primaries, compared with less than $10 million in congressional Democratic primaries, according to a Washington Post analysis of campaign finance records.\n\nA similar dynamic played out in the 2012 Republican presidential primaries, when the contenders were pummeled by super PACs aligned with their rivals. This year, the attacks by the GOP\u2019s tea party flank are spurring a financial arms race, as major \u00adcenter-right groups and business organizations step forward to bolster incumbents \u2014 an indication that the 2014 primary battles could be bloodier than past cycles.\n\n\u201cRight now, the Republicans all have their cannons aimed at each other,\u201d said Katon Dawson, a former South Carolina GOP chairman who is heading a new group, the West Main Street Values PAC, to help Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) fend off challenges from four primary opponents, \u201cand the Democrats are getting a free ride.\u201d\n\nThe 2014 battle lines are being drawn by powerhouses such as the Club for Growth, which launched a \u201cPrimary My Congressman\u201d effort last year to take on centrist Republicans. The organization is already backing challengers to eight-term Rep. Mike Simpson (Idaho) and Sen. Thad Cochran (Miss.) and may engage in more primaries.\n\nThe Senate Conservatives Fund, a group started by former senator Jim DeMint that promoted last year\u2019s government shutdown, has rallied behind conservatives taking on McConnell, Cochran and Sen. Pat Roberts (Kan.).\n\nIn Kentucky, the organization has already devoted nearly $1 million to help Matt Bevin, the conservative candidate challenging McConnell in the primary. More than half of that amount has gone to ads and mailers. Abruising TV spot it ran in the state in November charged that McConnell \u201chelped Barack Obama and Harry Reid fund Obamacare.\u201d The group has also given a large share of its funds directly to Bevin\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cWe believe that primaries are good, and voters deserve to have choices,\u201d said Matt Hoskins, executive director of the Senate Conservatives Fund. \u201cWe are going to do everything we can to help Matt Bevin win this race.\u201d\n\nIn January, the Washington-based tea party organization FreedomWorks announced its endorsement of Bevin, saying it planned to spend at least $500,000 on get-out-the-vote efforts on his behalf. Matt Kibbe, the group\u2019s president, said it will jump into more races in the coming weeks.\n\nConservative activists say they are making the party stronger, helping elect figures such as Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.).\n\n\u201cIf you look at our track record, we\u2019ve successfully repopulated the Republican Party with some pretty compelling young leaders,\u201d Kibbe said.\n\nThe fierce infighting has not prompted a widespread reassessment among Republicans about the merits of loosening campaign finance rules.\n\nJesse Benton, McConnell\u2019s campaign manager, said the senator is an \u201cunapologetic champion of the First Amendment,\u201d and \u201cif that means that a byproduct is that he has to take a little extra heat, he\u2019s going to do it.\u201d\n\nStill, Benton acknowledged, the outside attacks are \u201ca distraction and a nuisance that we would just as soon do without.\u201d\n\nIn several key \u00adraces, the tea party groups have not yet wielded the resources of Republican incumbents and their backers. But the groups have succeeded in forcing incumbents to engage early. By the end of September, McConnell had already dumped nearly $4 million into what is expected to be one of the most expensive Senate races of the cycle. McConnell also faces a strong Democratic challenger, Alison Lundergan Grimes, Kentucky\u2019s secretary of state.\n\nThe escalating tensions alarm many in the party, who say tea party groups are diverting time and money that could be better spent.\n\n\u201cOur best advocates and resource for retaking the Senate are Republican senators, and there\u2019s an opportunity cost of mindlessly primarying them for primary and profit sake,\u201d said Brad Dayspring, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee.\n\nCentrist GOP groups and industry organizations such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are firing back, laying plans to spend heavily to bolster McConnell and other establishment Republicans. They worry about the losses of tea party candidates in past cycles and the political damage experienced by the party during last year\u2019s government shutdown.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important there\u2019s a counter\u00adbalance to groups looking to profit from candidates who are either unelectable in a general election or unwilling to govern in a conservative fashion in Congress,\u201d said Dan Conston, a spokesman for the nonprofit advocacy group American Action Network, which is chaired by former senator Norm Coleman (R-Minn.).\n\nMain Street Partnership, a group led by former congressman Steven C. LaTourette (Ohio), plans to raise $8 million through a super PAC and nonprofit organization to help centrist Republicans such as Simpson, the Idaho congressman.\n\nDonors have been enthusiastic, said Sarah Chamberlain, the group\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cFor the first time, they\u2019re starting to understand that they\u2019re at war, and they have to step up,\u201d she said.\n\nThe expanding role of independent groups in campaigns has accelerated the calls by McConnell and other GOP leaders to lift the limits that remain on contributions to the now-weakened national party committees. Individuals cannot give them more than $32,400 a year.\n\nThe Supreme Court is considering a case, McCutcheon v. FEC, that could begin to chip away at those caps.\n\n\u201cBecause of fundraising restrictions on the political parties, their share of the independent expenditure pie has shrunk dramatically,\u201d said Michael Toner, a Republican campaign finance lawyer. \u201cOutside groups are playing more and more of a role, and that\u2019s empowering the far right.\u201d\n\nMany of the conservative groups active in elections this cycle predated Citizens United, but they relied largely on traditional political action committees, which can only accept donations of up to $5,000.\n\nIn the Citizens United case, the Supreme Court said that corporations could spend unlimited sums on political activity. That decision was cited a few months later by a lower court, which said there could be no restriction on the size of donations to independent political committees \u2014 a ruling that paved the way for super PACs.\n\nConservative groups were among those that embraced the new vehicles. Club for Growth, which spent $10.3 million in the 2008 cycle, poured $23.4 million into races in 2012 \u2014 including nearly $17 million through its super PAC Club for Growth Action.\n\nMore than $12 million of the money that Club for Growth Action raised in the last cycle came in the form of six- and seven-figure checks from donors such as tech investor Peter Thiel, private equity titan John Childs, New Jersey investor Virginia James and Texas home builder Bob Perry, who each gave at least $1 million, according to campaign finance records.\n\nPerry, who died in April, also gave a $1 million donation last year to the super PAC arm of Senate Conservatives Fund, a sizable chunk of the $9 million the group said it raised in 2013.\n\nConservative activists said that while they get big checks, one of the most important roles they play is in bundling small donations that go directly to the campaigns of the candidates they are backing.\n\n\u201cThe average amount that our donors give to our candidates is just $37,\u201d said Hoskins, of the Senate Conservatives Fund. \u201cSuper PACs can certainly raise large amounts from a few donors, but nothing is more powerful than having 10,000 people invest in a candidate.\u201d\n\nAlice Crites contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An unexpected legacy of Citizens United: more money to finance the GOP\u2019s intraparty war.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/mateagoldwashpost", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "An unexpected legacy of Citizens United: more money to finance the GOP\u2019s intraparty war.", "title": "Mitch McConnell and other GOP incumbents now feeling the brunt of the Citizens United effect", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/an-unexpected-legacy-of-citizens-united-more-money-to-finance-gops-intraparty-war/2014/02/01/df40aba0-8484-11e3-bbe5-6a2a3141e3a9_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/10/14/Others/Images/2013-10-14/m%2031381774751.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@dtkeating"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/an-unexpected-legacy-of-citizens-united-more-money-to-finance-gops-intraparty-war/2014/02/01/df40aba0-8484-11e3-bbe5-6a2a3141e3a9_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Mitch McConnell, Citizens United, 2014 midterms, Senate Conservatives Fund, Club for Growth, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, American Action Network, campaign spending, Supreme Court, SpeechNow", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/mateagoldwashpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "df40aba0-8484-11e3-bbe5-6a2a3141e3a9", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Mitch McConnell, Citizens United, 2014 midterms, Senate Conservatives Fund, Club for Growth, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, American Action Network, campaign spending, Supreme Court, SpeechNow"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1f16\"", "article_summary": "The escalating tensions alarm many in the party, who say tea party groups are diverting time and money that could be better spent.\n\u201cIf you look at our track record, we\u2019ve successfully repopulated the Republican Party with some pretty compelling young leaders,\u201d Kibbe said.\nThey worry about the losses of tea party candidates in past cycles and the political damage experienced by the party during last year\u2019s government shutdown.\nIn the Citizens United case, the Supreme Court said that corporations could spend unlimited sums on political activity.\nIn Kentucky, the organization has already devoted nearly $1 million to help Matt Bevin, the conservative candidate challenging McConnell in the primary."}
