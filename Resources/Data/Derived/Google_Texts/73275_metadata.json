But she was unable to summon another standout effort.\n\nPennetta, seeded 26th, seized control of the match with the tense victory in the first set. Vinci saved six break opportunities in the fifth game before finally having her serve broken and eventually losing in a tiebreaker.\n\nThe second set belonged to Pennetta as she won the first four games. The winning point came on a forehand shot and Pennetta tossed her racket in the air and initially appeared stunned that she has won her first Grand Slam title.\n\n\"I'm really happy right now,\" Pennetta said while still on the court. \"I have to say before this tournament I didn't think I could be the champion here. I' m really happy. This one for me is one of my favorite tournaments. I've always played good here. It's a dream come true.\"\n\nPennetta clarified that she would continue playing tennis the rest of this year before officially retiring.\n\nThe men's final will be contested Sunday between Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer.
