The friend in question is Ted Cruz. Mr. Nordlinger is expanding that piece this week in Impromptus. For Part I of the series, go here.\n\nWhere was I? I think Ted and Heidi were just married.\n\nAnyway, Ted worked at the Justice Department and at the Federal Trade Commission. Then he was solicitor general of Texas (under the attorney general, Greg Abbott, who would become governor). Frankly, I didn\u2019t know that states had solicitors general until Ted became one.\n\nOver the years, he had highs and lows; I had highs and lows. He was at least as good a friend in foul weather as in fair. We talked and talked, usually late at night (though not at Earl Campbell\u2019s, our BBQ joint in Austin).\n\nWe dreamed and schemed. Most of the scheming revolved around him. He would run for office, no doubt. It was a question of when and what (what office).\n\nI wanted to run for office, but how could I? I had nowhere to run, in this sense: In my life, I had lived in Ann Arbor, Mich.; Cambridge, Mass.; Georgetown, D.C.; and the Upper West Side of Manhattan.\n\nI\u2019m surprised I never had addresses in Madison and Berkeley.\n\nThe Republic is safe from me, I like to say. But Ted: He could run, for sure. And I would have the satisfaction of watching him do it. He would be in the arena, and I would be on the sidelines, surely, scribbling.\n\n(What do you think I\u2019m doing now?)\n\nIn 2009, he prepared to run for attorney general. I wrote about him for the first time \u2014 in a piece I have linked to already: here. \u201cA Great Reaganite Hope,\u201d I called it.\n\nI spent a couple of paragraphs commenting on the similarities, and dissimilarities, between Ted and the new president. Here is how I concluded those paragraphs: \u201cObama certainly rose quickly in American politics, very quickly (alas). Can Ted Cruz do the same? I don\u2019t know, but it would be good for the country.\u201d\n\nAs it happened, the attorney-general race did not come off \u2014 because the attorney-general position did not come open. Why? Well, in a nutshell, Kay Bailey Hutchison was supposed to resign from the Senate. Her doing so would have reshuffled the political deck in Texas. But she didn\u2019t. So \u2026\n\nTed went into private practice. I hope he made a lot of money. Because his desire was to go back on a government payroll.\n\nIn January 2011, he announced for the U.S. Senate. Whuh? The U.S. Senate? But he had never been elected to any political office. The U.S. Senate from Texas, the second-most-populous state in the country? Are you kidding?\n\nNo.\n\nBy coincidence, we were in the same town that night \u2014 Palo Alto, Calif. We talked late, late into the night.\n\nEarlier in the day, I had written a post, \u201cMy Candidate in Texas.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for Ted to run for office for a long time. Conservatives all across America will come to embrace him, I think \u2014 embrace him as a champion. Why not start early? There will be plenty of bandwagoneers later.\u201d\n\nI further said, \u201cI hope he goes to the Senate, and I hope he goes further than that.\u201d\n\nNow, Marco Rubio had just been sworn in as a senator. Some people were saying that the race Ted was about to run would be like the one that Marco had just run in Florida.\n\nAnd I wrote, \u201cA nightmare scenario for people like us \u2014 I\u2019m talking about Reaganites \u2026 \u2014 is that Senator Cruz and Senator Rubio compete in a presidential primary. But then, you could call that an embarrassment of riches.\u201d\n\nYou know, I was thinking 2020, 2024 \u2026\n\nImportant people told Ted not to bother to run for Senate. He had no money, no name recognition, no network. There were people in line ahead of him \u2014 senior politicians \u2014 and he should wait his turn. He\u2019d make a fool of himself if he didn\u2019t.\n\nI saw him campaign a bit in New York \u2014 meaning, at fundraisers. He was good at it. He \u201cconnected.\u201d I beat the drums for him a little. I\u2019d never done that kind of work. I enjoyed it. I wanted to see Ted get elected.\n\nHe was confident he would win. I mean, unwaveringly confident. Over and over, he told me he\u2019d win.\n\nAnd damned if he didn\u2019t.\n\nOn Election Night, I began a post by quoting a Gershwin song: \u201cThey all laughed at Christopher Columbus, when he said the world was round. They all laughed when Edison recorded sound.\u201d The song ends, \u201cWho\u2019s got the last laugh now?\u201d\n\nA left-wing journalist wrote me a nasty e-mail, saying, \u201cColumbus didn\u2019t say that! Your friend is an idiot!\u201d He thought I was quoting the candidate, Ted. I was insulted on Ira Gershwin\u2019s behalf. And wistful about a lost popular culture.\n\nBefore he was sworn in, he told me, \u201cThink of ways we can advance freedom. Think of ways we can defend and advance freedom \u2014 score points for freedom, fight for it.\u201d\n\nTypical Ted.\n\nWhen he got to the Senate, he made a big splash. Some people didn\u2019t like getting wet.\n\nI liked most of what Ted was doing \u2014 relished it. Some of it, I did not like. As I\u2019ve said before, we are friends, not clones.\n\nA few weeks ago, I took one of my nieces to The King and I. Its greatest song goes, \u201cHe will not always say what you would have him say.\u201d Well, sure.\n\nTed has a wider libertarian streak than I do. (Bill Buckley: \u201cWithin every conservative is a streak of libertarianism.\u201d) Also, he has less patience for the \u201cestablishment\u201d than I do. But, you know? He was the one who got elected, and you know what else? He kept his promises to the voters.\n\nSome may not have liked those promises. But, by golly, he kept them. Which is refreshing in a politician.\n\nAnd he did not sit around. Oh, no. He did not mark time. A senator observed, \u201cTed has done more in a couple of years here than some of our colleagues have done in decades.\u201d\n\nI could talk on and on \u2014 about drones, Obamacare, Planned Parenthood, and other things.
