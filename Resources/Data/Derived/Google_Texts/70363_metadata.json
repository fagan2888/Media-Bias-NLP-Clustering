By that time, surprisingly few commentators noticed the difference. What would become known as the \u201cChristian Right,\u201d or the \u201creligious right,\u201d had largely coalesced by the end of the 1970s, but the presidential race of 1980 thrust it further into the national spotlight. That year witnessed a conclusive pivot in modern evangelical politics\u2014a pivot, indeed, in the image of American evangelicalism as a whole. All three candidates in 1980\u2014Democratic incumbent Jimmy Carter, Republican challenger Ronald Reagan, and independent Republican John Anderson\u2014described themselves as born-again Christians. Yet Carter had lost his presumed base and Anderson had moved to the left in an effort to capture moderate Republicans and discontented Democrats. The energy resided on the right side of the evangelical spectrum. For the next three decades, the Christian Right\u2014a movement propelled by evangelicals but also containing sympathetic Catholics, Mormons, and a handful of Jewish allies\u2014occupied a distinct place in the imaginations of many Americans. The Christian Right\u2019s leaders received disproportionate media attention, not least because they served up a steady dish of spectacles. In the minds of many, they were the public expression of born-again Christianity. Politics, of course, hardly captured the full power of evangelicalism within American culture. But it influenced all impressions of that power.\n\nThe process happened very quickly. Less than four years after the rise of Jimmy Carter, journalists were unlikely to be caught off guard again by a proliferation of pious politics. The booming \u201celectric church\u201d\u2014later rebranded the \u201celectronic church\u201d and ultimately labeled \u201ctelevangelism\u201d\u2014had been a news media staple since at least 1978. Coverage naturally gravitated toward Lynchburg, Virginia, preacher Jerry Falwell, who had supported Anita Bryant\u2019s 1977 anti-gay-rights crusade, and Virginia Beach television mogul Pat Robertson, who was involved with the Washington for Jesus rally of April 1980 (scheduled to coincide with the anniversary of the first landing at Jamestown). The rally, which attracted a crowd of around 200,000, confirmed that born-again politics was back and that it now threatened President Jimmy Carter\u2019s livelihood. \u201cYou have seen the great silent majority,\u201d declared Robertson to the Capitol Mall crowd, invoking Nixon\u2019s populist metaphor. Falwell was not among the rally\u2019s participants, perhaps because he feared a low turnout, perhaps because the Baptist fundamentalist was uncomfortable with the charismatic faith of Robertson and the conference co-organizer John Gimenez. Yet Robertson himself was wary of risking his kingdom for a campaign. Falwell, head of the Moral Majority (another nod to Nixon), was more eager to enter the political arena. He thus became the first anointed spokesperson of what was then commonly called the \u201cReligious New Right.\u201d\n\nDuring the 1980 campaign, Ronald Reagan and the evangelical conservatives engaged in a very public courting ritual. Evangelicals had entertained possible GOP alternatives to Carter since at least 1979. Options abounded\u2014 ranging from right-wing purist Philip Crane of Illinois to early front-runner John Connally of Texas\u2014but Reagan, long a darling of conservatives in general, was an especially compelling choice. By the time Moral Majority executive director Robert Billings signed on as a Reagan campaign adviser, the deal was pretty much sealed. The 1980 GOP convention gave journalists further reason to believe that the Moral Majority had muscles to flex. As national outlets duly reported, Moral Majority supporters controlled the Alaska Republican organization. Congressman Guy Vander Jagt of Michigan, an evangelical conservative, delivered the keynote address. Convention delegates approved the GOP\u2019s most socially conservative platform ever, as the party strengthened its antiabortion stance and reversed its historic support for the Equal Rights Amendment. On social issues, at least, the pew trumped the country club. \u201cIt\u2019s right down the line an evangelical platform,\u201d gushed one Republican at the Detroit convention. Reagan struck an explicitly religious note in his acceptance speech (whereas Carter made no direct mention of God in his), merging established modes of civil religion with a newer rhetoric of antisecularism: \u201cI\u2019ll confess that I\u2019ve been a little afraid to suggest what I\u2019m going to suggest. I\u2019m more afraid not to,\u201d declared the nominee. He then paused. \u201cCan we begin our crusade joined together in a moment of silent prayer?\u201d This gesture followed Falwell\u2019s decision to stomach (if not endorse) the vice presidential selection of George H. W. Bush, a long-standing social moderate who had only recently embraced the antiabortion cause. While Bush vacationed with Billy Graham after the convention, Reagan intensified his courtship of the evangelical right. His most important stop was in Dallas for the National Affairs Briefing, an event intended to consummate the relationship between a vote-hungry Reagan and an electoral base in the making. There, Reagan uttered perhaps the most famous lines of the Age of Evangelicalism. They received prominent play in an influential Newsweek cover story three weeks later. \u201cI know you can\u2019t endorse me,\u201d he was quoted as saying. \u201cBut . . . I want you to know that I endorse you.\u201d The presence of Falwell in Detroit and Reagan in Dallas raised the profile of the Christian Right even further. Falwell soon appeared on daytime television shows debating liberal Protestant activist William Sloane Coffin.\n\nThe romance between Reagan and the Christian Right quickly experienced prominent hiccups. Christian Right leaders were not inclined to strike the more inclusive tone required of a successful presidential campaign. Baptist minister and former Carter backer Bailey Smith, speaking at the Dallas gathering, saw fit to aver that \u201cGod Almighty does not hear the prayer of a Jew.\u201d Then, Falwell felt compelled to clarify that God did hear the prayers of any Jew or Gentile, provided that they were converts to Christianity. The topic of Jewish salvation predictably greeted Reagan during his October visit to Lynchburg, where Falwell hosted a gathering of the National Religious Broadcasters. Confronted by journalists at the airport, the candidate embraced a much more generous take on God\u2019s sense of hearing. Falwell\u2014by then a political operative, as well as a fundamentalist minister\u2014agreed with Reagan a few days later, reversing his position after consulting with the American Jewish Committee\u2019s liaison to Christians, Rabbi Marc Tanenbaum. God \u201chears the heart cry of any sincere person who calls on Him,\u201d Falwell now stated.\n\nThe surge of attention given to the outspoken and provocative Falwell gave Carter an opening. Falwell, of course, did not speak for all evangelicals, not even for many of the televangelists who generally shared his theological outlook. \u201cIf I backed a Republican for President,\u201d wondered prominent televangelist Rex Humbard, \u201cwhat about the Democrats in my audience?\u201d A number of Reformed theologians criticized Falwell\u2019s politics as simplistic, while many members of the evangelical old guard\u2014not least, Billy Graham\u2014 kept their distance from the Virginian. Carter and his religious liaison, Robert Maddox, were aware of these divisions. They reached out to relatively nonpartisan evangelists like Jim Bakker (who, to be sure, had interviewed Reagan on his television show earlier that year). The other side of Carter\u2019s strategy involved branding the Moral Majority and its crowd as unrepresentative of American society in general and American Christianity in particular. Carter came late to this approach. In October, he noted that \u201cthe Bible doesn\u2019t say how you balance the federal budget. . . . It\u2019s never been done before, but certain religious groups are trying to say what the definition of a Christian is.\u201d Carter\u2019s tone was considerably more moderate than that of Secretary of Health and Human Services Patricia Roberts Harris. \u201cI am beginning to fear that we could have an Ayatollah Khomeini in this country,\u201d she declared in a September speech. Harris\u2019s real problem, Falwell shot back, was with the \u201cJudeo-Christian community\u201d itself.\n\nReagan won in a landslide, but the post-election sorting out of Moral Majority\u2019s role was much less conclusive. The initial verdict, buttressed by polling data that posited a near-equivalence between \u201cevangelical\u201d and \u201cMoral Majority,\u201d saw Falwell as the new political kingmaker. The minister did little to discourage such analysis. On the night following the election, Falwell offered commentary on an award-winning episode of \u201cNightline.\u201d Via satellite, he was connected with the defeated Democratic senators George McGovern, Birch Bayh, and Frank Church\u2014Christian Right targets all. \u201cGeorge Gallup didn\u2019t get a chance to declare 1980 the \u2018Year of Born-Again Politics,\u2019 \u201d two chroniclers wrote. \u201cThe evangelicals beat him to it.\u201d Christian Century listed the \u201cascendance of the New Religious Right\u201d as the top religious news story of 1980. As more sophisticated number crunchers demonstrated, though, Reagan had not needed the Christian Right\u2014however broadly defined\u2014to win. Moreover, as Seymour Martin Lipset and Earl Raab argued, it was impossible to separate religious motivations from other reasons for choosing a particular candidate. An eclectic range of figures, including civil rights icon Ralph Abernathy and Watergate prosecutor Leon Jaworski, had backed Reagan. Perhaps evangelical voters simply reflected the broader momentum. Still, evangelicals unquestionably were an important force in the Reagan wave. They were \u201cthe major factor,\u201d Albert Menendez subsequently contended, \u201cin twelve of the seventeen states that switched from Carter to Reagan.\u201d\n\nA second round of reconsiderations took the form of media criticism. Early reports vastly overestimated the audience size for televangelistic shows. Playboy reported a weekly television audience of thirty million for Falwell\u2019s \u201cOld-Time Gospel Hour.\u201d A better estimate for the average weekly audience for the top ten syndicated religious shows combined was seven to ten million. Even the higher-end estimates still trailed the weekly audience for the sitcom \u201cM.A.S.H.\u201d As such, Jerry Falwell remained less than a household name at the start of the Reagan Revolution. A Washington Post\u2013ABC News poll published in June 1981 revealed that half of Americans had not heard of Moral Majority, while those who had were sharply divided in their evaluations of the organization. Moral Majority was better known in a Bible Belt locale like Dallas-Fort Worth, but it was far from popular even in that metropolitan area. Perhaps, argued journalist Tina Rosenberg, the media itself had \u201cmade the Moral Majority.\u201d Players on both ends of the political spectrum, Rosenberg wrote, had \u201ca powerful interest in letting exaggeration and oversimplification pass for gospel truth.\u201d Still, she conceded, \u201cwhat\u2019s described as powerful often ends up being powerful.\u201d Media construction or not, many Republican elites believed that they needed the Moral Majority\u2014and the voters for whom it claimed to speak\u2014to sustain a political majority.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, the \u201cnew Christian Right\u201d (or the Christian Right) and the \u201cnew Religious Right\u201d (or the Religious Right) had become the preferred terms for an enduring American political phenomenon, replacing references to the \u201creligious New Right\u201d and largely subsuming allusions to a self-styled \u201cpro-family movement.\u201d Indeed, the Christian Right outlasted its organizational parent\u2014the conservative \u201cNew Right\u201d\u2014as a term with currency. Much of the print coverage acknowledged the diversity within American evangelicalism and used categories\u2014\u201cfundamentalist,\u201d \u201ccharismatic,\u201d and so on\u2014that evangelicals themselves often employed. Billy Graham\u2019s statement that Moral Majority did not speak for him received prominent play. Yet even Graham, who was a household name, was now framed in relation to the next big story. The joint meetings of the historically intertwined National Association of Evangelicals (NAE) and the National Religious Broadcasters during the late 1970s and early 1980s reinforced the impression that the new center of the evangelical world was the electronic church, especially its most politicized figures. Reagan\u2019s presence at three consecutive such meetings, from 1982 to 1984, contributed to that belief as well.\n\nThe Evangelical\u2019s President\n\nRonald Reagan was more an evangelical\u2019s president than an evangelical president. While lacking Jimmy Carter\u2019s Sunday School piety, Reagan was quite comfortable in his born-again skin (among many other skins). It was Reagan, not Carter, who inaugurated what scholars David Domke and Kevin Coe have called the \u201cGod strategy\u201d in American presidential politics, as \u201creligious communications increased to levels never before seen in the modern presidency.\u201d Since Reagan\u2019s two terms, \u201cU.S. presidential candidates who want to be taken seriously by religious voters, particularly conservatives, now face a come-to-Jesus moment in which they must display public religiosity in a manner that is inevitably calculated and yet cannot appear overtly so.\u201d Perhaps the clearest evidence of the God strategy was Reagan\u2019s persistent use of the expression \u201cGod bless America\u201d in his 1980 convention speech and throughout his two terms. A commonplace in presidential discourse at the start of the twenty-first century, \u201cGod bless America\u201d appeared in a major presidential address precisely once before Reagan (in 1973, as Richard Nixon attempted to mitigate the Watergate scandal). To a certain degree, the flourish was but a new spin on the all-American tradition of civil religion. Politicians had long proffered mere Christianity for political gain. Yet it was no coincidence that this newest rhetorical wrinkle appeared precisely as the Christian Right arose.\n\nFor the evangelical right, Reagan\u2019s presidency provided a lot of symbolism and a bit of substance, often blurring the line between the two. Reagan saw evangelical conservatives in much the same way that he viewed other major GOP constituencies (big business, defense hawks, etc.). Even as allegations swirled that White House aide Michael Deaver wanted Christian Right leaders to enter through the \u201cback door,\u201d Falwell was among the first visitors to the Reagan White House. Reagan knew, though, that his new coalition partners wanted some clear victories. A few of the president\u2019s initial appointments offered hope. James Watt, a Pentecostal and a strong conservative, joined the cabinet as Secretary of the Interior, antiabortion activist C. Everett Koop became surgeon general, and Robert Billings landed a position in the Department of Education. In the GOP-majority Senate, Richard Halverson\u2014 the ministerial dean of Beltway evangelicals\u2014served as chaplain. Morton Blackwell used his evangelical connections to massage relations with the Christian Right during his time as Reagan\u2019s liaison to conservatives. Faith Whittlesey, who took over Blackwell\u2019s outreach to religious conservatives, likewise kept out the welcome mat for evangelical leaders. Such contacts no doubt factored into Reagan\u2019s decision to declare 1983 the \u201cYear of the Bible\u201d and, that same year, to contribute an article to the antiabortion Human Life Review. At the start of the subsequent election year, the White House released an \u201cIssue Alert\u201d suggesting the \u201cmany ways\u201d in which public school officials could encourage voluntary (i.e., constitutionally permissible) student prayers during the school day. These were mere gestures, no doubt, but Carter\u2019s lack of similar moves had cost him dearly.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How Reagan's landslide victory in 1980 made the Moral Majority a force to be reckoned with in American politics", "author": "Steven P.
