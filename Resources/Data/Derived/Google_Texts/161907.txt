Every day firefighters risk their lives in the line of duty.

But Friday, some spent the morning battling a different blaze.

For 60 years, the International Association of Firefighters has partnered with the Muscular Dystrophy Association in their "Fill the Boot" campaign.

The purpose, to collect donations to help save the lives of those living with the disease.

"Volunteering a few more hours out here on behalf of the people that need the help, they need the assistance with research, as well as care and treatment for this disease," James Stultz, firefighter and event coordinator said.

The DeFuniak Springs Fire Department, along with the Professional Firefighters of Walton County are the two agencies that coordinated this campaign during the holiday weekend.

"Being that the international has supported this foundation for over 60 years, you know us as firefighters here in Walton County we wanted to participate in that as well," Stultz said.

This is the first time in years, Stultz says that the "Fill the Boot" campaign has taken place in Walton County; but with the good turn out, he suspects this is a tradition they will continue.

"This year was kind of a tester to get our toes back in the water and see what the participation level was both on the passerby, as well as the firefighters so I think we have a good idea of what to expect for next year. And we definitely want to make this an annual event that we hold all across Walton County," said Stultz.
