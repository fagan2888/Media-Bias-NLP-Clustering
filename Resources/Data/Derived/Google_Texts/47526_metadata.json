With a net worth of $76 billion, the Microsoft Corp co-founder reclaimed the top spot after a four-year hiatus, toppling Mexico's telecommunications mogul Carlos Slim Helu, who placed second at $72 billion, Forbes said in announcing the list on Monday.\n\nAmancio Ortega, the Spanish founder of clothing conglomerate Inditex SA, which includes the Zara fashion chain, ranked third at $64 billion. Investing icon Warren Buffett, who runs Berkshire Hathaway Inc and is a frequent bridge partner for Gates, was fourth at $58.2 billion. Oracle Corp chief Larry Ellison came in fifth at $48 billion.\n\nGates has topped the list in 15 of the last 20 years. A record 1,645 billionaires with a total net worth of $6.4 trillion made Forbes' list, up from 1,426 last year. Just over 10 percent were female, with 172 women compared with 138 a year earlier.\n\nWal-Mart Stores Inc heiress Christy Walton was the highest-ranking woman, in ninth place, at $36.7 billion. France's Liliane Bettencourt, who got much of her wealth from cosmetics company L'Oreal SA, was next among women at $34.5 billion, and ranked 11th overall.\n\nThe Internet was well-represented. Google Inc founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin ranked 17th and 19th, worth a respective $32.3 billion and $31.8 billion, while Amazon.com Inc's Jeff Bezos was between them at $32 billion. Facebook Inc founder Mark Zuckerberg, 29, more than doubled his net worth to $28.5 billion, and ranked 21st. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who left office two months ago, was 16th at $33 billion, built mainly through his eponymous media company.\n\nForbes said the year's biggest loser was Brazilian tycoon Eike Batista, whose net worth fell below $300 million from $10.6 billion as his oil and natural resources empire collapsed amid too much debt and falling output. Roughly two-thirds of the world's billionaires, or 1,080, were self-made. The United States had the most billionaires, with 492, followed by China at 152 and Russia at 111. Algeria, Lithuania, Tanzania and Uganda joined the list with one each.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bill Gates reclaims top of Forbes' billionaires list", "author": "Jonathan Stempal/Reuters", "og": {"site_name": "Metro", "description": "Bill Gates reclaims top of Forbes' billionaires list", "title": "Bill Gates reclaims top of Forbes' billionaires list", "url": "http://www.metro.us/news/bill-gates-reclaims-top-of-forbes-billionaires-list/tmWncd---69OOdGeBY9xOY/", "image": "http://www.metro.us/_internal/gxml!0/4dntvuhh2yeo4npyb3igdet73odaolf$qmummq1c9r6uhva5cp535xshwn2zqrl/2013-02-19T170611Z_2_CBRE91I13PX00_RTROPTP_4_MEXICO1-614x452.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "metro.us", "description": "Bill Gates reclaims top of Forbes' billionaires list", "creator": "Jonathan Stempal/Reuters", "image": {"src": "http://www.metro.us/_internal/gxml!0/4dntvuhh2yeo4npyb3igdet73odaolf$qmummq1c9r6uhva5cp535xshwn2zqrl/2013-02-19T170611Z_2_CBRE91I13PX00_RTROPTP_4_MEXICO1-614x452.jpeg"}, "title": "Bill Gates reclaims top of Forbes' billionaires list", "site": "@Metro_US", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9F42CC1BA36D4325E006BBA620C3B678", "robots": "index,follow,noodp,noydir", "mediatype": "Article", "keywords": "Money,Region National,money,Bill Gates, billionaires, Forbes", "fb": {"app_id": 1610587402522117, "pages": 146825895340972}, "date": "2014-10-10", "article": {"contentgroup": "Article Automatic,US Legacy Import Automatic", "section": "/news/money", "published_time": "2014-03-04T18:52:02Z", "modified_time": "2014-03-04T18:52:02Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Money,Region National,money,Bill Gates, billionaires, Forbes"}, "article_summary": "A record 1,645 billionaires with a total net worth of $6.4 trillion made Forbes' list, up from 1,426 last year.\nMicrosoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates has a net worth of $76 billion.\nCredit: ReutersBill Gates has returned to the top of Forbes magazine's annual list of the world's richest people, as rising stock markets swelled the ranks of billionaires, which included a record number of women.\nFacebook Inc founder Mark Zuckerberg, 29, more than doubled his net worth to $28.5 billion, and ranked 21st.\nInvesting icon Warren Buffett, who runs Berkshire Hathaway Inc and is a frequent bridge partner for Gates, was fourth at $58.2 billion."}
