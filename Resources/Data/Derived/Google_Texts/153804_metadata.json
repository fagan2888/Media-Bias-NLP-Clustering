Brightree\u2019s President and CEO Dave Cormack, as well as the company\u2019s employees, will all continue in their current roles.\n\nDLA serves as legal counsel to ResMed on the deal. Brightree has tapped Cooley LLP to act in a similar capacity and William Blair to act as its financial adviser.\n\nRedMed\u2019s purchase adds its name to the growing list of medical device acquisitions.
