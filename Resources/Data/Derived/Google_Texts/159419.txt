When Barack Obama first ran for president, the American public was sold on several things. He was young, he had a family, he was a gifted orator. He seemed bright and in the 2008 primary season he didn’t attack his main opponent, Hillary Clinton. Was this a new kind of politician? As it turns out, no.

One of the other things we were told about Mr. Obama was that he had been a professor of constitutional law. He was an expert on the U.S. Constitution.

As the U.S. Supreme Court considers parts of the Obamacare law, we are reminded that maybe Obama wasn’t such an expert on the Constitution after all. Or that he has no respect for it.

In his 2010 State of the Union speech to Congress and to the nation, President Obama scolded the high court because he didn’t like the justices’ interpretation of the law. It differed from his opinion.

Just last week, he mocked the Supreme Court of the United States while speaking in Germany. Mr. Obama presumed to know better than the court what cases it should should and shouldn’t hear.

Now, he is lobbying publicly to try and sway the outcome of the court on Obamacare. Apparently Barack Obama really doesn’t understand the roles of the co-equal branches of government as outlined in Constitution.

Or maybe he just thinks he knows better than nine Supreme Court justices and the Founding Fathers.
