View Full Caption Getty Images/Pablo Martinez Monsivais\n\nUPPER EAST SIDE \u2014 The public will get the chance to see Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as she's honored by the Roosevelt Institute at its Four Freedoms Awards ceremony later this month.\n\nGinsburg will be one of five people \u2014 alongside New York City Ballet's first African American male dancer, Arthur Mitchell, leading oncologist Dr. Olufunmilayo Olapade, civil rights activist Rev. Dr. William Barber and Katrina vanden Heuvel for The Nation, a progressive magazine \u2014 to receive an award from the institute at the St. James Church on Madison Avenue on Sept. 29.\n\nThose who attend the open event could have a chance to meet the honorees, who will all be there in person to accept their awards, according to Chris Linsmayer, a spokesman for the institute.\n\nGinsburg, the second woman to be appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court, will be awarded the institute's Freedom Medal for championing fairness and equality for all, according to the institute.\n\nSince 1980, the justice has had a role in deciding monumental cases like in Obergefell v. Hodges that made same-sex marriage legal in all 50 states, and King v. Burwell, which upheld a component of Affordable Care Act, among many others. Before she became justice, she served as the director of the Women's Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union in the 1970s.\n\nThe Freedom Awards are given to those who show a commitment to the principals that former President Franklin D. Roosevelt proclaimed in his speech to Congress in 1941: the freedom of speech and expression, the freedom of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear.\n\nThe Roosevelt Institute, is a think tank centered on driving the economy and social debate. In the past, it has awarded leaders like Hilary Clinton, former President Harry S. Truman, Coretta Scott King and former South African President Nelson Mandela.\n\nThe ceremony will begin at 5:30 p.m. at St. James Church at 865 Madison Ave.\n\nThose interested in attending should RSVP online.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "description": "Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will be honored during a public ceremony later this month.", "application-name": "DNAinfo", "og": {"url": "https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150910/upper-east-side/heres-your-chance-meet-notorious-rbg-ruth-bader-ginsberg", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "https://assets.dnainfo.com/generated/photo/2015/09/ruth-bader-ginsburg-1441912699.jpg/extralarge.jpg", "height": 400}, "site_name": "DNAinfo New York", "description": "Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will be honored during a public ceremony later this month.", "title": "Here's Your Chance to Meet 'Notorious RBG' Ruth Bader Ginsburg"}, "referrer": "always", "twitter": {"site": "@DNAinfo", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "DNAinfo", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-70x70px.png", "robots": "noarchive,noodp,noydir", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "54902139,1379988119,575522805,108424,5519941,48600120,112261,662865465", "app_id": 153948644632011}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Carnegie Hill,Yorkville,Lenox Hill,Roosevelt Island,Upper East Side,Politics,roosevelt institute,four freedoms awards,Awards,ruth bader ginsburg,Ruth Bader Ginsburg,St. James Church,Upper East Side,Madison Avenue", "google-site-verification": "AYA-4dHbK-igtSqpqIYyKuCbHO3o3KourjkrAnfCeZc", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-150x150.png", "googletag": {"topic": "politics", "tags": "awards,roosevelt-institute,four-freedoms-awards,ruth-bader-ginsburg", "places": "upper-east-side,madison-avenue,st-james-church", "people": "ruth-bader-ginsburg"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1aaa\"", "article_summary": "Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will be one of five to receive the Roosevelt Institute's Four Freedoms Award.\nThe Roosevelt Institute, is a think tank centered on driving the economy and social debate.\nView Full Caption Getty Images/Pablo Martinez MonsivaisUPPER EAST SIDE \u2014 The public will get the chance to see Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as she's honored by the Roosevelt Institute at its Four Freedoms Awards ceremony later this month.\nGinsburg, the second woman to be appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court, will be awarded the institute's Freedom Medal for championing fairness and equality for all, according to the institute.\nThe ceremony will begin at 5:30 p.m. at St. James Church at 865 Madison Ave.Those interested in attending should RSVP online."}
