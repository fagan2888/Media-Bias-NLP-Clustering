At a joint conference here this week, House and Senate Republicans coalesced around that goal and began to plan their agenda.\n\nRepublicans hope to come up with major proposals to replace the Affordable Care Act \u2013 which they\u2019ve been working on for more than five years \u2013 as well as welfare reform, tax reform, and other major conservative policies. They don\u2019t have any delusions that President Obama will sign their plans into law, but they aim to accomplish two things: one, set a clear marker between Republican and Democratic priorities heading into the November election, and two, give Republicans momentum (and ready-to-go legislation) if the election goes their way and they control the White House in 2017.\n\n\u201cThe kind of agenda we\u2019re talking about forming is what could we do if we had a Republican president,\u201d Ryan told reporters in a briefing Thursday afternoon. \u201cWhat does 2017 look like if the election goes the way we hope it goes? That is why we think it is important for us to offer a positive, solutions-oriented approach and agenda to the American people so that they \u2026 can choose in 2016 what kind of country they want to have.\"\n\nThis week\u2019s retreat in Baltimore \u2013 dubbed an \u201cideas conference\u201d and started the day after Obama laid out his own vision for the country in his final State of the Union address \u2013 sets the stage for this Republican plan of action. The majority of congressional Republicans are here for two or three days to hear from three groups: pollsters, talking about key issues in 2016; influential conservatives on the economy, health care, national security, government reform and other critical policy areas; and their own leaders, Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nWhile Ryan has laid out his vision for the party, McConnell has taken a more low-key approach in articulating his goals for 2016. The rules and procedures in the Senate make it notoriously difficult to quickly move major legislation, and the minority party has great power to grind things to a halt. That makes the bold agenda planned for the House next to impossible in the upper chamber. McConnell\u2019s focus is less on big ideas than it is on protecting his fragile majority, for one, and passing the individual appropriations bills to fund the government, avoiding a trillion-plus-dollar omnibus measure like the one that passed last month. Even that might prove difficult: none of the 12 appropriations bills made it through the Senate last year, and all 12 haven\u2019t passed both chambers together in more than two decades.\n\nFurther causing problems for McConnell is a threat from his counterpart, Minority Leader Harry Reid, to push votes on proposals from Donald Trump, the frontrunner for the Republican nomination for president, including his controversial call to ban Muslims from entering the United States. McConnell said he\u2019d tried to avoid \u201cturning the Senate into a studio\u201d for the presidential campaign, but added, \u201cWhat\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander.\u201d He also said Republicans would respond by forcing votes on amendments related to proposals from Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders that could put Democrats in difficult positions.\n\nWhile tough messaging votes may come to dominate certain weeks this year, there are a few areas where bipartisan deal making remains possible. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said mental health legislation and criminal justice reform are two areas where he expected not only bipartisan support in Congress, but help from the White House. He said he went to a meeting with Obama at the White House several weeks ago to discuss criminal justice reform, and Obama told lawmakers: \u201cI\u2019ll be out front on this or I will sit in the background, whatever you think best enhances the chance of getting something done.\u201d\n\nBeyond those narrow goals, though, there isn\u2019t much hope for sweeping legislation to actually become law. Instead, the goal is for sweeping proposed legislation that will outline the party platform and animate voters. Another calculation for GOP lawmakers on that front is shielding themselves from the heated and often very negative rhetoric of the presidential primary.\n\nThere\u2019s been concern within the party in recent weeks over whether certain candidates \u2013 notably Trump or Texas Sen. Ted Cruz \u2013 would damage lawmakers\u2019 down-ballot campaigns. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the third-ranking Republican in the upper chamber, said it was \u201cjust inevitable\u201d that the primary rhetoric would be heated, and while lawmakers can\u2019t control the presidential race, they can put themselves in a more positive light.\n\n\u201cWhat we want to do is articulate a clear, positive vision, (an) agenda for the future of this country and the presidential campaign,\u201d Thune said. \u201cAt some point, when we have our nominee, hopefully we\u2019ll be able to sync up with them and their agenda. But we want to make sure that our members have something they can be talking about when they go out to try to convince voters to give them another opportunity to represent them.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "BALTIMORE \u2013 Paul Ryan has been explicit about his goal since taking over as House speaker: he wants to lay out a bold agenda of conservative policies in order to shape the presidential...", "title": "Congressional Republicans Want to Put Stamp on 2016 | RealClearPolitics", "fragment": "!", "twitter": {"site": "@RealClearNews", "card": "summary"}, "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2016/01/15/congressional_republicans_want_to_put_stamp_on_2016_129322.html", "image": "http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/335345_5_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "BALTIMORE \u2013 Paul Ryan has been explicit about his goal since taking over as House speaker: he wants to lay out a bold agenda of conservative policies in order to shape the presidential...", "title": "Congressional Republicans Want to Put Stamp on 2016 | RealClearPolitics"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "tweetmeme-title": "Congressional Republicans Want to Put Stamp on 2016 | RealClearPolitics", "keywords": "Republican primary,Criminal justice reform,health care reform,affordable care act,Republican presidential race,econnomy,national security,budget,illegal immigration,Republican Party,Mitch McConnell,John Thune,Paul Ryan,Election 2016,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0a39\"", "article_summary": "At a joint conference here this week, House and Senate Republicans coalesced around that goal and began to plan their agenda.\nWhile Ryan has laid out his vision for the party, McConnell has taken a more low-key approach in articulating his goals for 2016.\n\u201cAt some point, when we have our nominee, hopefully we\u2019ll be able to sync up with them and their agenda.\n\u201cThe kind of agenda we\u2019re talking about forming is what could we do if we had a Republican president,\u201d Ryan told reporters in a briefing Thursday afternoon.\nRepublicans hope to come up with major proposals to replace the Affordable Care Act \u2013 which they\u2019ve been working on for more than five years \u2013 as well as welfare reform, tax reform, and other major conservative policies."}
