Since then, it's been a battle in the courts, going all the way to the Iowa Supreme Court.\n\nIn a unanimous decision, the High Court affirmed the lower court's ruling that Jacobsma was responsible for the citation issued to him, and that the cameras are in fact constitutional.\n\n\n\n\"Well, I'm disappointed and I disagree with the court's opinion. I respect the court's opinion, though, and that's what we'll have to abide by,\" Jacobsma said.\n\n\n\nNicole Jensen was one of the city attorneys representing Sioux City, and she says the city is pleased by the court's decision.\n\n\n\n\"There were several claims made in regards to due process and Constitutional Rights. The city felt the ordinance was in fact proper and hoped the court would find it exactly as it did,\" Jensen said.\n\n\n\nJacobsma says that the bigger picture behind the court's ruling is that other towns and cities in Iowa could implement similar ordinances; and he says that's a slippery slope.\n\n\"Unfortunately, I think the court's decision gives legal authority now to other cities all over Iowa to basically take a motorist or a person's money without having to prove they committed the violation,\" Jacobsma said.\n\n\n\nJacobsma's next course of action would be to petition the US Supreme Court to grant him Writ of Certiorari and hear the case.\n\nHe has 90 days to file a petition.\n\nNews\n\nGeneral {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
