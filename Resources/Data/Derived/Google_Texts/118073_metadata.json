The agency said the new rule was \u201clargely non-controversial\u201d for most of that time, but that \u201cnew concerns were raised recently due to the different population of uninsured, non-disabled adults now being served under Medicaid expansion.\u201d\n\nWhile the governor\u2019s office had to clear the way for possibly as much as $3 million in lost budgeted revenue, Health Care Authority Director Dorothy Teeter said she anticipates the change will have minimal lost revenue since nearly all recoveries have been for long-term care expenses.\n\n\u201cAn outdated policy was producing significant concern from families newly eligible for Medicaid,\u201d Teeter said in the statement released Monday from HCA. \u201cChanging this old policy was simply the right thing to do after hearing from many in our community who were questioning whether to sign up for coverage at all.\u201d\n\nBy making the change, said State Medicaid Director MaryAnne Lindeblad, \u201cwe are removing an additional perceived barrier to cost-effective coverge for uninsured Washingtonians.\u201d\n\nTo make the change, the state will file an emergency rule to amend WAC 182-527-2742, and the state will amend its contract with the federal government. HCA spokesman Jim Stevenson said he expect a draft rule to be produced within days.", "article_metadata": {"t_omni_path": "st|health|healthcarecheckup|article", "description": "The state\u00a0issued notice Monday that it will amend its estate recovery policy to avoid 'unintended consequences' for people who enroll in Medicaid for health care under the expansion made possible by the Affordable Care Act.
