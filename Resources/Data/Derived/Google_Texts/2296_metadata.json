My grandfather had wanted that money to go to his heirs.\u201d\n\nRelated: Should You Leave Your Home to Your Kids?\n\nThe money could have paid for college for her two kids and her brothers\u2019 kids, she believes. Frustrated and deeply upset from the feud, she says frankly, \u201cI can understand how people snap and even want to have someone knocked off. I\u2019ve had to walk away, because when I think about it I go crazy.\u201d\n\nFamilies have been fighting for \u2013 well, forever \u2013 but increasingly they\u2019re feuding over inheritances. \u201cThe problem is getting worse as the population ages and as boomers are inheriting their parents\u2019 estates and leaving their own estates to their millennial children,\u201d says attorney Ike Devji, of Lodmell & Lodmell.\n\nWith divorce and blended families common today, litigation is on the rise as Americans work through the courts to get at least a piece of their inheritance. Given the stock market\u2019s record performance lately, people have accumulated wealth that they eventually need to distribute \u2013 and younger generations don\u2019t want to miss out.\n\nRelated: 10 Ridiculous Lawsuits that Cost You Money\n\n\u201cThe vast amount of wealth generated in the last several decades has contributed to the desire on the part of those who inherit to make sure they participate to the extent they feel they are entitled,\u201d says Anne O\u2019Brien, a trust and estate attorney with Caplin & Drysdale in Washington D.C. In most cases, the disputes are about control or lack of control and the perceived lack of equality.\n\nHere\u2019s how to keep inheritance feuds from destroying your family:\n\nTalk before you write. Before solidifying your estate plans, talk to your children and other heirs about their wishes. Find out if there\u2019s anything you might deem insignificant that has a lot of meaning to a family member. If there are personal possessions, for example, that a family member wants, either gift it to them beforehand, write a memorandum or have a family meeting to inform your heirs of your intentions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen nasty arguments in probate court that stemmed from a collection of figurines or a favorite piece of jewelry that could have been avoided by a discussion beforehand,\u201d says Emily Boothroyd, a financial planning specialist at Westport Resources in Westport, CT.\n\nUpdate your documents. With second or third marriages, it\u2019s easy to forget to review the beneficiaries in your documents \u2013 which is a recipe for disaster. Check beneficiaries on pension payout plans, IRAs, Roth IRAS, 401(k)s, and life insurance policies. Check the title of your home to be sure that it\u2019s set up properly so when one spouse dies, the surviving spouse can stay in the home.\n\n\u201cI once worked with clients who at the time were in their 60s,\u201d says Melody Judge, founder of Life Income Management in Southfield, MI. \u201cThey were in a second marriage and each of their first spouses had died. When I asked about beneficiaries, the husband not only had not changed his life insurance beneficiary to reflect his new wife, the primary home was still in the deceased wife\u2019s name.\u201d\n\nPlan early. Create an estate plan while you are healthy and of sound mind. If you wait for an illness to put together your will, trusts, power of attorney and other documents, you might make poor decisions because you\u2019re not thinking clearly, and in the worst case, the legality of your documents could be challenged.\n\nRelated: 5 Estate Planning Mistakes to Avoid\n\nThis is no time to go it alone. Get the help of an estate planning attorney or financial planner. You can create unintended problems if you\u2019re not careful. For example, be wary of joint ownership.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for a parent to add a child to a bank account to help with the finances,\u201d says Ramsey Bahrawy, an attorney in North Andover, MA. \u201cThis creates a presumption of a gift, meaning that the account belongs to the joint owner upon death. Was that actually the intent? Convenience accounts are the source of many disputes.\u201d\n\nBe fair. Often the issue is not equal division of assets, but fairness \u2013 two separate concepts. \u201cOne child who has taken care of his parent might deserve to receive a bigger share of inheritance and that might be fair,\u201d explains Peter Cordua, managing member of the accounting firm Cordua Pastore & Associates in Pennsauken Township, NJ.\n\nWhen Seena Sharp\u2019s mother developed cancer, she asked her three daughters to choose an item she owned with both monetary and sentimental value. \u201cWe each made a list of what each daughter would get and signed it,\u201d says Sharp, who lives in Los Angeles. \u201cThere was one item that had much more value than the others, so the daughter who received it had it appraised, and gave each of the other two 33 percent of the appraisal. It wasn\u2019t exactly fair, but it wasn\u2019t worth the hassle otherwise.\u201d\n\nWhen her mother died several months later, a tough time was made easier because there was nothing to fight over. Instead, the daughters cherished their memories.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Families are increasingly fighting over inheritances Here\u2019s how to keep inheritance feuds from ruining your family", "title": "4 Wise Ways to Avoid a Family Feud Among Heirs", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/16/4-Wise-Ways-Avoid-Family-Feud-Among-Heirs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04192010_Herman_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/16/4-Wise-Ways-Avoid-Family-Feud-Among-Heirs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04192010_Herman_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Families are increasingly fighting over inheritances Here\u2019s how to keep inheritance feuds from ruining your family", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc94d8\"", "article_summary": "Find out if there\u2019s anything you might deem insignificant that has a lot of meaning to a family member.\nIf there are personal possessions, for example, that a family member wants, either gift it to them beforehand, write a memorandum or have a family meeting to inform your heirs of your intentions.\nGet the help of an estate planning attorney or financial planner.\nRelated: 5 Estate Planning Mistakes to AvoidThis is no time to go it alone.\nFrustrated and deeply upset from the feud, she says frankly, \u201cI can understand how people snap and even want to have someone knocked off."}
