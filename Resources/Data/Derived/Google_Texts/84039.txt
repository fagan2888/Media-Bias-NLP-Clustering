President Barack Obama met in the Oval Office on Friday with Emma Didlake, a 110-year-old who is the oldest living veteran in the United States.

Didlake joined the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps in 1943 as a 38-year-old with five children, and served as a private and driver, WJBK reported. She earned the Women's Army Corps Service Medal, American Campaign Medal and World War II Victory Medal for her service. After leaving the military, Didlake joined the Detroit chapter of the NAACP, and marched with Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1963, according to WJBK.
