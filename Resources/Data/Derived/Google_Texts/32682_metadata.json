They are against Obamacare, and they don\u2019t want to be forced to pay for the law when they go out to eat.\n\nWell, better start scrutinizing the fine print of those restaurant receipts. Already, some eateries in Florida and California are tacking on what amounts to Obamacare surcharges to customer's checks.\n\n\n\nA local sports bar chain in Florida made national news for its Obamacare surcharge tucked into its guest checks under the heading \u201cACA Surcharge\u201d \u2013 as in Affordable Care Act.\n\nGator\u2019s Dockside, a chain of self-described \u201cfamily-friendly, sports-themed restaurants\u201d in Florida, slapped a surcharge on customers that works out to about 1% of the total bill, according to Forbes.com.\n\n\n\nA photo of one receipt posted on the web shows a subtotal of $21.15 with applicable sales tax of $1.49 and ACA surcharge of $.20.\n\nNot enough to give one heartburn, you say?\n\nWell consider this: The portion of Obamacare that is leading to the so-called surcharge hasn\u2019t even taken effect yet. This is the employer mandate, under which employers with 50 or more full-time employees must offer healthcare, and it takes effect in 2015. So it\u2019s possible these surcharges could grow in size and spread to more and more eating establishments.\n\nSo what do you think of the so-called Obamacare surcharge showing up on restaurant bills of a few eating establishments across the country?\n\nWould it give you indigestion to pay for Obamacare as part of your meal?\n\nOr would you consider the small charge a minor incidental to a great lunch or dinner?\n\nGive us your recipe for resolving this Obamacare restaurant flap in the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@mobile','@topstories','daily buzz','dining','food','obamacare','restaurants'", "title": "Some restaurants adding small Obamacare surcharge to guest checks: Indigestion or incidental?", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Some restaurants adding small Obamacare surcharge to guest checks: Indigestion or incidental?\", \"link\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2014/03/some_restaurants_adding_small.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/midstate_impact/photo/obamacare-restaurant-surchargejpg-0fabbf59eab5f22e.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12338622\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-03-03T12:39:33Z\", \"author\": \"John Luciew | jluciew@pennlive.com\", \"tags\": [\"@mobile\",\"@topstories\",\"daily buzz\",\"dining\",\"food\",\"obamacare\",\"restaurants\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.pennlive.com/midstate_impact/photo/14402388-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@JohnLuciew", "site": "@pennlive", "card": "summary", "description": "Opponents of Obamacare better better start scrutinizing the fine print of those restaurant receipts, or they could help pay for the Affordable Care Act with restaurant surcharges."}, "article_date_updated": "Monday, March 03, 2014,  7:40 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.pennlive.com/midstate_impact/photo/obamacare-restaurant-surchargejpg-0fabbf59eab5f22e.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"jluciew\", \"author_nickname\": \"John Luciew | jluciew@pennlive.com\", \"author_id\": \"508\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Breaking News on PennLive\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "PennLive.com", "description": "Opponents of Obamacare better better start scrutinizing the fine print of those restaurant receipts, or they could help pay for the Affordable Care Act with restaurant surcharges.", "title": "Some restaurants adding small Obamacare surcharge to guest checks: Indigestion or incidental?", "url": "http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2014/03/some_restaurants_adding_small.html", "image": "http://www.pennlive.com/static/aff/static/img/logos/logo_fb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "PennLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Monday, March 03, 2014,  7:45 AM", "article_author": "John Luciew | jluciew@pennlive.com", "Description": "Opponents of Obamacare better better start scrutinizing the fine print of those restaurant receipts, or they could help pay for the Affordable Care Act with restaurant surcharges."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda4c0\"", "article_summary": "A local sports bar chain in Florida made national news for its Obamacare surcharge tucked into its guest checks under the heading \u201cACA Surcharge\u201d \u2013 as in Affordable Care Act.\nSo what do you think of the so-called Obamacare surcharge showing up on restaurant bills of a few eating establishments across the country?\nAlready, some eateries in Florida and California are tacking on what amounts to Obamacare surcharges to customer's checks.\nDepending upon one\u2019s politics, the surcharge a small number of restaurants has begun adding to the food and beverage totals of their guests could cause indigestion.\nGive us your recipe for resolving this Obamacare restaurant flap in the comments."}
