The corporation is betting it will be better off paying those costs rather than paying regular premiums to an insurance company.\n\n\u201cThe key is to have healthy, engaged, productive, present employees,\u201d says Martha Lanning, the company\u2019s director of health and wellness plans.\n\nSherwin-Williams and its employees aren\u2019t likely to use the individual marketplace created by Obamacare, but they will help pay for it.\n\nLanning says companies like Sherwin-Williams must devote staff members to sorting through the legal and administrative issues connected of the Affordable Care Act. These efforts cost money.\n\nShe adds, \u201cwe also have to pay that transitional reinsurance fee that totals for us, um, with some other aspects of the Affordable Care Act about $4 million in 2014.\u201d\n\nThe government collects $63 from large self-insured employers and insurance companies for every covered life under a plan, which includes each employee and each dependent it insures.\n\nThat money goes into a fund for health insurance companies, that reimburses them for some extra costs involved in providing coverage to high-risk individuals on the Obamacare exchanges.\n\nYou might think of it as a subsidy from big business for making insurance coverage available to everyone without regard to pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe fee is reduced next year and is set to gradually disappear over the next three years. Mark Hall, a professor of law and public health at Wake Forest University, says it\u2019s a sensible solution to a temporary problem.\n\n\u201cThe great feature of the Affordable Care Act is it now makes everyone qualify for coverage but that means the first people to sign up or to show up are going to be the folks who need it the most. So we expect, particularly at the outset, that there is going to be a heavy load on the insurance pool of high cost people,\u201d Hall says.\n\nBut Helen Darling, who heads the D.C.-based National Business Group on Health, fears the fee won\u2019t actually go away in three years.\n\n\u201cOnce something is in law and somebody\u2019s got an idea about a new tax, you\u2019re always nervous that that\u2019s going to become a way to finance something else and something that is supposed to go away and be sunset-ed wouldn\u2019t be because they needed the money,\u201d Darling says.\n\nFor a company like Sherwin-Williams with $10 billion in sales last year and a net income increase of 70 percent over the last three years, the added cost seems modest, at most. In fact, human resource executives at companies nationwide said as much in a recent national survey by Mercer, the consulting company. The survey concluded found 55 percent of executives felt the Affordable Care Act was having no effect on business operations and performance apart from benefits.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a burden employers aren\u2019t carrying alone. Mercer also found that most large employers are requiring workers to pay part of the ACA fees.\n\nSherwin-Williams, for its part, is committed to providing insurance to its employees, says Lanning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be the differentiating factor for businesses moving forward,\u201d she says.\n\nAfter all, she adds, the key to an engaged and productive workforce is its health.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sherwin-Williams is one of the self-insured companies that pays a fee to help cover high-risk individuals that enrolled on newly created insurance exchanges.
