Reacting to the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold Obamacare subsidies, radio host Hugh Hewitt turned the tables Thursday, bringing Hillary Clinton into the equation and labeling her “the grandmother of Obamacare.”

Hewitt, the author of the new book “The Queen,” gave Clinton the label based on her work on Hillarycare during the Clinton administration. The radio host added that the Clinton campaign won’t be “so happy” over the court’s decision because every Republican candidate in 2016 now gets “a free swing” at her over the law.
