He was gored in the groin and the thigh in Pamplona's bull ring at the end of the run and was treated by doctors on the scene before being taken to a city hospital. His injuries were described as minor.\n\nA Spaniard was hospitalized for rib injuries while a Frenchman was treated for multiple bruises but later released.\n\nTwo Americans and a Briton were gored and eight others injured in the first run Tuesday. All but the two Americans were released the same day.\n\nOne American still hospitalized was Mike Webster, a 38-year-old occupational therapist from Gainesville, Florida, who was gored in the armpit as he joined the bull-run in Pamplona for the 38th time in 11 years. He said Tuesday he hadn't decided whether he'd run again.\n\nThe other was identified only by his initials, R.H.O., a 25-year-old from Tempe, Arizona, who suffered facial bruising.\n\nThe nationally televised 8 a.m. run sees people racing with six bulls and their guiding steer along a narrow 930-yard (850-meter) course from a holding pen to the city bull ring. The bulls are then killed by professional matadors in bullfights each afternoon.\n\nWednesday's run lasted 2 minutes, 14 seconds.\n\nThe nine-day fiesta in Pamplona, which features 24-hour street partying, was made famous in Ernest Hemingway's 1926 novel \"The Sun Also Rises\" and attracts thousands of foreign tourists.\n\nBull runs are a traditional part of summer festivals across Spain. Dozens are injured each year, mostly in falls.\n\nTwo men died recently after being gored by bulls in Spanish festivals \u2014 one Saturday in the eastern town of Grao de Castellon and another June 24 in the southwestern town of Coria.\n\nIn all, 15 people have died from gorings in Pamplona since record-keeping began in 1924 for the San Fermin festival.\n\n___\n\nGiles reported from Madrid", "article_metadata": {"description": "1 Australian gored, 2 injured in fast 2nd Pamplona bull-run - AP News: PAMPLONA, Spain (AP) \u2014 An Australian was gored twice by .05/26/2016 20:19:47PM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "PAMPLONA, Spain (AP) \u2014 An Australian was gored twice by a fighting bull and two", "title": "AP News - 1 Australian gored, 2 injured in fast 2nd Pamplona bull-run", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2015/07/08/i-person-gored-2-injured-in-fast-2nd-pamplona-bullrun-n2022639", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015\\189\\8a0a8eda-eb46-4d1d-b781-34e748040e46.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "PAMPLONA, Spain (AP) \u2014 An Australian was gored twice by a fighting bull and two", "title": "AP News - 1 Australian gored, 2 injured in fast 2nd Pamplona bull-run", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2015/07/08/i-person-gored-2-injured-in-fast-2nd-pamplona-bullrun-n2022639", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/189/8a0a8eda-eb46-4d1d-b781-34e748040e46.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "1 Australian gored, 2 injured in fast 2nd Pamplona bull-run, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "The San Fermin press office said the victim was a 27-year-old man identified only by his initials, T.L.O.\nIn all, 15 people have died from gorings in Pamplona since record-keeping began in 1924 for the San Fermin festival.\nPAMPLONA, Spain (AP) \u2014 An Australian was gored twice by a fighting bull and two people suffered other injuries as thousands of thrill-seekers dashed alongside the beasts in the second bull-run of Pamplona's San Fermin festival Wednesday.\nTwo Americans and a Briton were gored and eight others injured in the first run Tuesday.\nA Spaniard was hospitalized for rib injuries while a Frenchman was treated for multiple bruises but later released."}
