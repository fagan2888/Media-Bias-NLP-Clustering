Pathologists can play a central role in performance improvement and delivering safe, high-quality care. As critical members of the health care team, pathologists intersect nearly all aspects of patient care, from diagnostics to prevention and primary care. To discuss the role of pathology in diagnosis, quality and patient safety, Health Forum convened a group of pathologists and hospital executives Nov. 4 in Chicago, with sponsorship by the College of American Pathologists. Pathologists can have a big impact on patient outcomes and experience by helping clinicians determine the right test at the right time for the right patient, the panelists agreed.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have to bring ourselves out of the basement to be more active and visible,\u201d says Eva Wojcik, M.D., chair of the Department of Pathology at Loyola University Medical Center, Chicago. \u201cWe have to get out from behind the microscopes and be part of the team.\u201d As members of multidisciplinary care teams, pathologists can affect patient experience and outcomes in several important ways. Pathologists are responsible for the provision of timely, accurate diagnostic laboratory tests. They can also support evidence-based care by educating clinicians about the role of pathology in patient care. \u201cWe need to play a greater role in education, particularly around appropriate test utilization,\u201d says Ritu Nayar, M.D., professor of pathology at Northwestern University and Northwestern University Hospital, Chicago. \u201cIf someone orders the incorrect test, we need to provide an explanation as to why it\u2019s not the right test for the patient.\u201d Adds Wendy Leutgens, R.N., president, Loyola University Medical Center, Chicago, \u201cWe won\u2019t get paid for unnecessary tests, so it\u2019s in everybody\u2019s best interest to get it right. The focus is on quality care in the right setting.\u201d\n\n\n\nOther key findings of the dialogue include:\n\nPathology can play a significant role in population health and value-based care, providing actionable data to ensure the delivery of effective, efficient patient care delivery.\n\nPathology needs to be reinstated into clinical education, so all clinicians have an understanding of the discipline, as well as the appropriateness and efficacy of the tests they order.\n\nPathologists are essential participants in team-based care, providing clinical expertise in diagnostic and predictive medicine.\n\n\n\nA full copy of the dialogue will appear in the February issue of Hospitals & Health Networks.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "As hospitals and health systems continue the transition to value-based care, one important resource is too often overlooked.
