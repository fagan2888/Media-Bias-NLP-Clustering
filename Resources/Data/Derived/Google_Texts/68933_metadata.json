Rising costs and continued challenges make certain health care will continue to be a big issue in 2014. Recently, Capital Business sat down with experts from the University of Maryland and the Arlington consultancy Evolent Health to talk about health care and the opportunities ahead for information technology to improve efficiency and quality of care.\n\nJoining the conversation were Ritu Agarwal, founder and director of the Center for Health Information at the University of Maryland\u2019s Robert H. Smith School of Business; Karoline Mortensen, assistant professor of health services administration, University of Maryland Public Health; and Shandy Guharoy, vice president for information technology for Evolent Health.\n\nHere are excerpts from their conversation with Dan Beyers, editor of Capital Business:\n\nWhat are some of the issues right now for consumers \u2014 what should they be thinking about?\n\nMortensen: \u201cThe biggest challenge right now facing consumers is how do you get the information about these exchanges to that population? Recent surveys report that as many as 70 percent of the uninsured responding to these surveys are not familiar with what the exchanges are designed to do. And this is a critical issue because the exchanges are beyond just purchasing private health insurance coverage for higher-income populations: They\u2019re also about Medicaid enrollment for lower-income populations. This is a big step forward in terms of one-stop shopping.\u201d\n\nIs mobile a wave of the future in health care like so many other industries?\n\nAgarwal: \u201cI\u2019m incredibly bullish on the potential of mobile technologies for helping us achieve the goals that health care has set for itself. Mobile technologies give us a way of really addressing one of the persistent problems in health care, and that is patient activation and engagement. As consumers of health care, we have been completely disengaged from the process of taking care of our own health, and we rely on experts \u2014 our doctors \u2014 to tell us what to do.\n\n\u201cMobile technologies I think offer the potential to flip that equation, and essentially through tracking, maintaining information, being reminded what you need to do to stay healthy, we can achieve a lot of the quality and cost goals that we\u2019ve set for ourselves.\n\n\u201cIf we could have a mobile technology that engages consumers and reminds them every once in while, motivates them, puts them in social settings where they can compete \u2014 all of those kinds of opportunities, I think, will bring us to a health-care system where patients are watching out for themselves on a daily basis, and then meeting with doctors only when there is a clinical encounter or clinical need that really needs that expert intervention.\u201d\n\nGive me one big idea that you think that we can really help change the nature of health care right now.\n\nAgarwal: \u201cPersonalized medicine. It\u2019s the natural progression and advancement of health care. It says that all treatments, all therapies, all health care, all health-care instructions \u2014 everything related to the management of a person\u2019s health \u2014 is going to be tailored specifically for you, rather than saying these are vast populations and we\u2019re going to use the same kind of treatment for them.\n\n\u201cSo how do we get to the goal of personalized medicine? One, we have to understand every human being\u2019s genome, and we\u2019ve made remarkable progress with the human genome project on that. Second, we have to understand your behavioral patterns; we have to understand the specific situation contingencies that you live in. All of the data that\u2019s needed to drive personalized medicine is now in the process of being collected, stored and digitized.\n\n\u201cWe have advanced technologies that will allow us to discover patterns that we\u2019ve never seen before \u2014 so at the end of the day, we can really take care of somebody\u2019s health from a personalized perspective.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very big idea. It\u2019s going to take us two, three, maybe even four decades to get there, but I think all the pieces that are needed for personalized medicine are slowly going into place and I\u2019m very excited about the future.\u201d\n\nHow do you keep up on the technology, and create architectures that get us to where we need to go in the future to have something like a personalized medical system?\n\nGuharoy: \u201cIt\u2019s data versus insights. The data is already there; what is the insight from the data? From population health management where you are aggregating the data, you are seeing the trends in the data, you are being able to predict and forecast. And the next part of it is personalization. It\u2019s a step by step.\n\n\u201cThese are lifestyle changes. Look at how our mobile and our cellphones that we carry with us have changed our lives. The same thing will happen in health care.\u201d\n\nHear the full conversation on health care at the Smith School\u2019s Web site, www.rhsmith.umd.edu.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "capbiznews", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "With the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, health care was a hot topic in 2013.
