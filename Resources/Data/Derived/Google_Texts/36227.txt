He's a RINO. She's a RINO. They are all RINOs.

You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.

Calling Republicans RINOs — Republican-In-Name-Only — is nothing new.

We were doing it in 1881, and it was still not a new insult back then.

We were doing it in 1962.

As long as people have hated politicians and politicians have hated their primary opponents, there have been RINOs.

However, the practice has become a tad obsessive in recent years, as the definition of RINO has expanded to include many more offenses, and has a tendency to change rapidly as political fortunes and allegiances are altered. A RINO is no longer a person who does not vote for policies supported by the Republican Party platform. A RINO can simply be a person who has been in D.C. for decades. A RINO can be a person who was endorsed by a RINO. If a RINO donated to your campaign, you are definitely a RINO. If you are a Republican who lives in a blue state, you might be a RINO. Your uncle who always talks about taxes at Thanksgiving dinner and voted for Reagan but loves "Modern Family"is probably a RINO. This week, if you voted for House Speaker John Boehner in the leadership election, you are a RINO.

President Obama is basically a RINO, as were President Reagan and Harrison Ford in "Air Force One."

We searched the Web to see how many House Republicans in the 114th Congress have been called RINOs on the Internet. It would have been easy to declare that all House Republicans are RINOs if we included comment sections, Web sites that just publish long lists of Republicans they consider fakes and several Twitter accounts that function only to tweet "RINO!" at elected officials. We did not fall down that dark rabbit hole, but it was still insanely easy to find instances of nearly every elected official being called a RINO.

We found that only 73 Republicans out of the 246 currently in the House had not been called by a RINO -- as far as we could tell.

By this logic, 173 House Republicans are not actually Republicans.

It's time to retire this word. Come up with a new one if you'd like, but in a world where Trey Gowdy, Joe Wilson and Steve DesJarlais can all be called RINOs, you're doing it wrong.
