But the mother, whose parental rights have not been terminated, is contesting the state\u2019s decision.\n\nThe state argues that it has the authority to consent to a \u201cdo not resuscitate\u201d order for any child in its custody if it is in the child\u2019s best interest.\n\nNot so, contend Alliance Defending Freedom attorneys, who filed a brief on behalf of the Christian Civic League of Maine, the Christian Medical and Dental Associations, Concerned Women for America and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Portland.\n\nThe child was injured when her father allegedly shook her, and she\u2019s been in state custody while the case plays out, records show.\n\nThe state wants the DNR order on the child on the assumption that the injuries are severe and will at some point be fatal, even though they occurred last year. The mother, the brief explains, is \u201cin court because she wants to give the baby a fighting chance to live while the state wants to hasten her death.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone deserves a fighting chance to live. All this mother is doing is fighting for that chance for her baby,\u201d said ADF Senior Counsel Steven H. Aden. \u201cThis mother\u2019s parental rights should not be ignored; no one has the authority to deny her the right to save her daughter\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nState officials did not respond to a WND request for comment.\n\nThe ADF brief explains the father has been indicted on a charge of aggravated assault. ADF said doctors at one point told the mother the child was in a coma, and she agreed to a DNR order then.\n\nThe legal team said hospital staff \u201cplaced the child in the mother\u2019s arms to die, but the child continued to breathe on her own and opened her eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter days went by in this fashion, the parents canceled the DNR order, and the child later came out of the coma and became alert. Despite this, medical personnel wanted to reinstate the DNR order because they said the baby\u2019s condition was still grave, but the parents would not agree.\u201d\n\nSo state agency bureaucrats went to court to obtain that DNR order \u201ccontrary to the parents\u2019 wishes.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven when a state agency believes the parent\u2019s decision to be incorrect, that does not permit it to interfere in the parent\u2019s right to make medical decisions for her child,\u201d the brief explains.\n\n\u201cIf the lower court\u2019s ruling is allowed to stand, A.P.\u2019s institutional physicians will medicate her as desired under the DNR, and she may in fact require resuscitation \u2013 but then she will not be treated due to the DNR, and thus she will die \u2013 and her mother\u2019s parental rights would be de facto and irrevocably terminated in one of the cruelest ways imaginable.\u201d\n\nAden explained: \u201cThe state is effectively arguing that this mom isn\u2019t fit to make medical decisions for her child simply because she wants the child to live. No one has declared this mother an unfit parent, yet the government wants to take her place. The Maine Supreme Judicial Court should reaffirm Mainers\u2019 interest in life, parental rights, and the integrity of the medical profession by reversing the lower court and restoring this mom\u2019s full rights to make medical decisions on her daughter\u2019s behalf.\u201d\n\nThe brief argues the state doesn\u2019t have a constitutional right to interfere.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. and Maine Constitutions and the cases interpreting them unquestionably guarantee fundamental rights to live, and to parent. Moreover, they afford the chance to make use of procedural due process \u2013 that is, the proper procedure in relation to the case at hand. And Maine itself has a rational and compelling interest in preserving the value of life, protecting the\n\nvulnerable, and upholding the integrity of the medical profession, for the good of all Mainers,\u201d it says.\n\n\u201cThis court may prevent the tragic and unpredictable consequences to life, the vulnerable, and the medical profession that are likely to result from allowing a department to overrule a parent\u2019s reasoned, loving medical decision for her child. Wherefore, amici respectfully request that the lower court\u2019s order granting the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Motion for Expedited Judicial Review be reversed and remanded for further consideration in line with constitutional and case precedent. A.P.\u2019s mother should be allowed a full and fair chance to parent, and continue to exercise her right to make medical decisions for her daughter.\u201d\n\nThe attorneys say the case \u201cis about fundamental rights: the right to live, and the right to parent.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Maine Constitution places great value on human life, echoing the U.S. Declaration of Independence and providing that \u2018[a]ll people are born equally free and independent, and have certain natural, inherent, and unalienable rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and of pursuing and obtaining safety and happiness.'\u201d\n\nThey argue there is a \u201cfundamental difference between respecting the right of a patient and her legal guardian to exercise the right not to undergo unwanted extraordinary measures and a physician pressuring a patient or the patient\u2019s parent to agree to a potentially life-ending DNR.\u201d\n\nAlthough the court records refer to the case by initials, the local Portland Press Herald in Maine reports the case of Kevin Peaslee, 21, who was bailed out of jail in January after he was charged in a shaken-baby case.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "A mother is asking the Maine Supreme Judicial Court to overturn a state-imposed \u201cdo not resuscitate\u201d order for her injured daughter, who is temporarily in the custody of the state.
