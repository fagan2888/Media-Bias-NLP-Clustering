A Colorado Springs man died Saturday after being flung from a commercial raft while floating on the Royal Gorge section of the Arkansas River — the second drowning on the river in less than a week.

The rafter, Christopher Sevilla, 44, “had apparently been having some type of respiratory problems before he and five other rafters were tossed out of a commercial raft while negotiating rough waters in the Gorge,” according to a statement from the Fremont County Sheriff’s Office.

At about 1:30 p.m. Saturday, Colorado Parks and Wildlife rangers notified sheriff’s deputies that they were performing CPR on a rafter who was being brought out of the Royal Gorge aboard the Royal Gorge Route Railroad train.

The release stated that after exiting the raft, Sevilla floated downriver some distance before he was pulled to shore unresponsive.

Rescuers tried to resuscitate him and flagged down the tourist train, which was headed back to Cañon City.

Sevilla was pronounced dead when the train arrived at the South First Street crossing.

Sevilla was wearing a helmet and flotation device and was not believed to be with other family members on the raft trip, the media release from the sheriff’s office stated.

Van Hodges, 48, of Enid, Okla., also drowned Tuesday in a commercial rafting accident after the raft he was in hit rough water and went up on its side in the Bighorn Sheep Canyon, according to the Fremont County Sheriff’s Office.

Officials added that in the Hodges drowning, five of the seven people in the raft were tossed into the river. Four of those rafters were able to be assisted back into the raft, the sheriff’s office said, but Hodges was pulled under water for several minutes by the river’s current before he surfaced.
