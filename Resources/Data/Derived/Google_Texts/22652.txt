FORT WAYNE, Ind. (WANE) Dr. Pam Galloway is one of 10 candidates running for Indiana’s representative for the 3rd district in Congress. If elected, the Republican said she would dismantle Obamacare and replace it with free market solutions.

Galloway is a physician, a surgeon and former Senator in Wisconsin. She said her and her husband moved to Indiana for family reasons.

She describes her transition from physician to politician as seamless, saying she’s been able to use her listening and problem solving skills to talk with voters.

“People really like it when someone comes to their door and is willing to listen,” she said.

Galloway graduated from medical school in the 1980s. She said the last three years of her practice she focused solely on breast cancer surgery.

“I’ve always tried- everywhere I went- to make sure that women have the best possible diagnostic care and treatment for breast cancer,” Galloway said.

Other areas of focus for Galloway’s campaign include defending the second amendment and protecting life, faith, family and country.

Galloway lives in Warsaw with her husband. They have a black Labrador named Walter.
