It was easy to use and maintain, and it was reliable in extreme conditions, be they hot, cold, wet or sandy.\n\nFrom the early 1950s, it became the standard weapon for Soviet and Warsaw Pact countries, according to IHS Jane\u2019s. The gun also proved popular with paramilitary groups: It was so successful in Mozambique\u2019s successful rebel movement of the 1960s and 1970s that its image appears in the national flag.\n\nRussia stopped producing AK-47 models in the late 1960s, but production of variants continued there and in other countries.\n\nThe Guinness World Records book recognized the AK-47 \u2014 AK being a Russian acronym for \u201cKalashnikov\u2019s machine gun\u201d and 47 standing for its debut year \u2014 as the world\u2019s most common machine gun.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin on Monday \u201cexpressed his deepest condolences to the family of Mikhail Kalashnikov in connection with his death,\u201d a post on the Kremlin\u2019s website read.\n\nIn 2009, Kalashnikov told CNN that two main qualities described the AK-47: simplicity and reliability.\n\n\u201cIt is very important because a soldier doesn\u2019t have university degrees,\u201d he said. \u201cHe needs a simple and reliable weapon. Just as an academic, for that matter, in a combat situation. There\u2019s simply no time to figure how to operate a complicated weapon and press many buttons when the enemy is advancing on you.\u201d\n\nHe said the question he hated most was whether he felt sorry about the hundreds of thousands of people that were killed as a result of his invention. He had a standard answer:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve designed my weapon to defend the borders of our Fatherland, and let it continue to serve this purpose.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, Izhmash, the Russian manufacturer of the AK-47 family of weapons, said it was abandoning the design in favor of a new one for its next-generation assault rifles.\n\nKalashnikov\u2019s 90th birthday, in November 2009, was celebrated in Russia nearly like a national holiday.
