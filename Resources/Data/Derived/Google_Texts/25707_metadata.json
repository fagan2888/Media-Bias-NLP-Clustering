That\u2019s when I asked the question, well, don\u2019t they sell drugs out in Potomac and Springfield, and places like that? Maybe you all think they don\u2019t, but statistics show they use more drugs out in those areas than anywhere. The special agent in charge, he says \u201cYou know, if we go out there and start messing with those folks, they know judges, they know lawyers, they know politicians. You start locking their kids up, somebody\u2019s going to jerk our chain.\u201d He said they\u2019re going to call us on it, and before you know it, they\u2019re going to shut us down, and there goes your overtime. What I began to see is that the drug war is totally about race.

They would have said, \u201cLet\u2019s stop this craziness. You\u2019re not putting my son in jail. My daughter isn\u2019t going to jail.\u201d\n\nThe phenomenon Fogg discusses is more ultimately about class than race, but the two are interlinked in America so thoroughly that's an understandable conflation.\n\nThe full video:\n\nRead Matt Welch from the Feburary issue of Reason on \"It's Not Just About Race, It's About Power.\" Previous Reason blogging on Fogg.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "An interesting video interview from Brave New Films features former Drug Enforcement Administration agent and federal marshal Matthew Fogg, speaking from", "title": "Yes, the Drug War is in Practice Deliberately Racist and Classist", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/03/09/yes-the-drug-war-is-in-practice-delibera", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14259390371885.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14259390371885.jpg", "description": "An interesting video interview from Brave New Films features\nformer Drug Enforcement Administration agent and federal marshal\nMatthew Fogg, speaking from his experience about the class and race\naspects of how the drug war is fought.\nAn excerpt from what he said on camera:\n\n\"When...we were setting up all of our drug and gun and addiction\ntask force determining what cities we were going to hit, I would\nnotice that most of the time it always appeared to be urban\nareas.\nThat\u2019s when I asked the question, well, don\u2019t they sell drugs\nout in Potomac and Springfield, and places like that?
