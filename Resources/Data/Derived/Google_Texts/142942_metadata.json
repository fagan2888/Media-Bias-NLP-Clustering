Helping others is the only way we get through this.\"\n\n\n\nIn his blog post, Noseworthy notes Mayo also is applying engineering principles to include quality, safety and service. \"We purposefully design, implement, and systematically diffuse quality-improvement efforts at all of our locations around the country.\"\n\nHe also pushes for \"a payment system that recognizes the spectrum of healthcare delivery across primary, intermediate, and complex care while rewarding the quality and value of each,\" and replacing the Medicare sustainable growth rate (SGR) formula with \"new, negotiated payment models that tie reimbursement to quality outcomes across the spectrum of care.\"\n\nFor more information:\n\n- read Noseworthy's blog post\n\n- here's the JAMIA study\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nFarzad Mostashari: Let me be blunt\n\nCentralized remote monitoring from Mayo Clinic to shorten hospital stays\n\n5 steps healthcare leaders can take to nurture innovation\n\nMayo Clinic CEO: Overhaul Medicare payment system", "article_metadata": {"description": "Knowledge management is the key to improving care across all settings and financial stability, the Mayo Clinic's president and CEO contends in a blog post published by the Harvard Business Review.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Knowledge management is the key to improving care across all settings and financial stability, the Mayo Clinic's president and CEO contends in a blog post published by the Harvard Business Review.", "title": "Mayo Clinic CEO: Knowledge management improves care quality", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/mayo-clinic-ceo-knowledge-management-improves-care-quality/2013-10-15", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,Health Information Technology,John Noseworthy,Knowledge Management,Operations & Business Management,Sustainable Health Care", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Health Information Technology,Operations & Business Management"}, "article_summary": "The Mayo Clinic has an archive of knowledge including evidence-based protocols, order sets, alerts and care process models, including a regularly updated tool called Ask Mayo Expert, according to the article.\nIn his blog post, Noseworthy notes Mayo also is applying engineering principles to include quality, safety and service.\nKnowledge management is the key to improving care across all settings and financial stability, the Mayo Clinic's president and CEO contends in a blog post published by the Harvard Business Review.\nThe industry can more effectively reduce the \"fragmentation and variability in care\" by creating tools to share knowledge among providers in their communities, Noseworthy contends.\nFor more information:- read Noseworthy's blog post- here's the JAMIA studyRelated Articles:Farzad Mostashari: Let me be bluntCentralized remote monitoring from Mayo Clinic to shorten hospital stays5 steps healthcare leaders can take to nurture innovationMayo Clinic CEO: Overhaul Medicare payment system"}
