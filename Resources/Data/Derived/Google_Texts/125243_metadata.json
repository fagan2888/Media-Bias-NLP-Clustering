And some said that beforehand, not many. And all of this stuff that we\u2019re seeing today, the rise of ISIS, the disintegration of the state in Iraq, the disintegration of the state in Syria, I think is arguably directly connected to our invasion. We destroyed the state. This is what happens when you destroy a state. You have chaos. You have the rise of factions, regional and ethnic factions, and I think we can look at that decision and say that\u2019s the reason that hundreds of thousands, probably a couple of million actually, if you add it all up, people have been killed.\u201d\n\nRegarding the current fight against ISIS he stated, \u201cwe\u2019re kind of doing it half assed. And I understand why. The president, and a lot of the American people who elected him don\u2019t want to go back into Iraq. They elected him to get out of Iraq, after all. And they\u2019re reluctant to go any further than we have.\u201d\n\nClarke continued by criticizing Congress as well, arguing, \u201cBut now we have 3,000 troops there as advisers, as trainers, and we could probably do what we need to do with that number, or only slightly more. But there are political decisions to be made. And think the American people and the Congress ought to be part of that. And the Congress has been asked by the president months ago now to make a decision, to vote on the use of force against ISIS, and they\u2019ve refused to do it. It\u2019s incredible. When the Congress is not asked, as has frequently been the case with a lot of presidents, they bitch and moan that they weren\u2019t asked. And now we have a president who says, \u2018Okay, I used to be on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I know I should ask for this. I\u2019ve asked for this.\u2019 Nothing.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWhat I\u2019d like to see is us equipping the Kurds, us equipping the Sunnis, who are anti-ISIS, and giving air cover, a lot more than we\u2019re doing, to all of those people, and even to the Iranian-supported militias, which the administration\u2019s considering. You look at the number of air sorties that we\u2019re doing, they\u2019re very low. And the reason for that is we don\u2019t have forward air controllers. So, where \u2014 we don\u2019t want collateral damage, so we\u2019re not bringing in airstrikes.\u201d He later stated that calling for sending thousands more troops is \u201ccrazy,\u201d and the US\u2019 approach should be \u201cintelligence-based \u2014 driven, using special forces, using air power, and arming the people out there who are on the other side. And we haven\u2019t done that.\u201d\n\nClarke concluded that the US keeps creating its own enemies, but that he isn\u2019t sure how to avoid doing this. He continued that ISIS is a \u201clarge, capable force\u201d that is a threat to the US, and that while the US \u201ccould well\u201d create another enemy by fighting ISIS, \u201cfor now, we know that we\u2019ve got this threat and I think we need to do something about it.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former White House counterterrorism adviser Dick Clarke said that the US is \"kind of doing it half assed\" in the fight against ISIS", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Former White House counterterrorism adviser Dick Clarke said that the US is \"kind of doing it half assed\" in the fight against ISIS", "title": "Dick Clarke: US Fight Against ISIS 'Kind of Doing It Half Assed' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/Dick-Clarke-521-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/05/21/dick-clarke-us-fight-against-isis-kind-of-doing-it-half-assed/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Former White House counterterrorism adviser Dick Clarke said that the US is \"kind of doing it half assed\" in the fight against ISIS", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/Dick-Clarke-521-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Dick Clarke: US Fight Against ISIS 'Kind of Doing It Half Assed' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Dick Clarke, ISIS, Richard Clarke,Breitbart TV, Middle East,ISIS", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "Richard Clarke", "published_time": "2015-05-21T19:07:54-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Middle East"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4212\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFormer White House counterterrorism adviser Dick Clarke said that the US is \u201ckind of doing it half assed\u201d in the fight against ISIS during an interview broadcast on Thursday\u2019s \u201cAll In with Chris Hayes\u201d on MSNBC.\nThe president, and a lot of the American people who elected him don\u2019t want to go back into Iraq.\nAnd we haven\u2019t done that.\u201dClarke concluded that the US keeps creating its own enemies, but that he isn\u2019t sure how to avoid doing this.\nYou look at the number of air sorties that we\u2019re doing, they\u2019re very low.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERClarke began by saying, \u201cWe opened Pandora\u2019s box when we went into Iraq."}
