'Every time someone comes over, I have to explain why the fence is there \u2014 and tell them we\u2019re rent stabilized, like it\u2019s a badge I have to wear.'\n\nA similar balcony on a market-rate apartment going for $3,692 per month has no wiring, claims the report.\n\nClancy told the Post he couldn't imagine a prospective market-rate tenant being told: 'You get this beautiful view of Manhattan behind a giant metal fence.'\n\nAt least eight units are fenced in, the Post reported. One terrace has been rendered useless with wiring that leaves just a couple of feet of room.\n\nThe 117-unit building's developer, Queensboro Development, told the couple the fence was necessary so window washers could set up before clean up, according to the Post.\n\n'It has come to our clients\u2019 attention that you are exceeding your area of usage,' the building's attorney, William Slochowsky, wrote the couple on Oct. 28, according to the Post.\n\nBut a former super told McFadzen and Clancy 'the fence is there to stay' because of market-rate residents with tiny balconies, the newspaper reported.\n\nThe 17-story Q41 building, at 23-10 41st Avenue in Long Island City, had been stalled until the city pumped $7.6 million in subsidies, according to the Post.\n\nCalls to Queensboro Development went unanswered, the newspaper reported.\n\nThis is not the first building in New York City to offer separate amenities for rent-controlled and market-rate tenants.\n\nDeveloper Extell has drawn much criticism for its plan to build a posh tower on Manhattan's Upper West Side using massive tax breaks \u2014 but then make its affordable-housing tenants use a different entrance from high-paying residents\n\nThe building's 'poor door' wouldn't be its only difference: under its original plan, some of the higher-paying residents would also have access to different amenities.\n\nErin McFadzen claims the fence is there so tenants with smaller balconies and who pay market-rate don't get jealous of the amenity she gets for a lower price\n\nPlans for the luxury skyscraper at 1 West End Ave. were slightly altered in August: the building still has separate entrances, but all residents will now have access to such building amenities as a courtyard and river-view roof deck\n\nThe affordable segment's lobby will also be stylishly appointed and set facing a park, the developer claims.\n\nSome residents and officials still see the divisions as discriminatory.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Fury,luxury,building,fences,balcony,used,rent,controlled,tenants,high,paying,residents,smaller,balconies,don,t,jealous",
