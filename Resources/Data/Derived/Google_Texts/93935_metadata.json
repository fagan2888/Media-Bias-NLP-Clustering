In his daily briefing, a smirking White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, \u201cToday\u2019s victories conclusively prove that the president\u2019s critics were operating from ignorance and partisanship, and not in the best interests of the United States and the region.\u201d President Obama is scheduled to appear on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press this Sunday to discuss this rare Middle East success for his administration.\n\nMosul, Iraq, October 13, 2014 \u2014 Turning away from battling ISIS forces which have regrouped and repelled each FSA attack since the \u201cmoderates\u2019\u201d modest victories last week, the Free Syrian Army has returned to what its leadership has consistently said is its true goal: attacking the forces of the Assad regime. Although the FSA has some weapons superior to those used by the Syrian government\u2019s regular army forces, especially in small and vehicle-mounted guns, there appear to be both Russian and Iranian military advisors serving alongside the Assad forces and giving them a distinct tactical advantage over the quickly trained FSA. So far, while the FSA has not lost many men, they have not taken any new ground and have ceded control of several small towns and villages in northern Syria to government forces. When asked about the events, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said simply, \u201cWe can\u2019t expect never to lose any battles against a foe as extreme as ISIS.\u201d When pointed out by a reporter that the battle did not involve ISIS, Mr. Earnest offered only, \u201cJust remember, Osama bin Laden is dead. We don\u2019t have anything to prove.\u201d\n\nKirkuk, Iraq, October 14, 2014 \u2014 FSA forces positioned to encircle an Assad regime army post were bombed and strafed by the Syrian Air Force, killing nearly 100 FSA soldiers and causing a panicked retreat by the rebels. During the daily Pentagon briefing, spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby was asked about Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel\u2019s September testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee in which Hagel said that the U.S. \u201cwill help\u201d rebel groups if they are attacked by Bashar Assad\u2019s forces. RADM Kirby, appearing frustrated, said, \u201cCENTCOM commanders are ready to act on the president\u2019s orders at a moment\u2019s notice.\u201d When pressed by CNN\u2019s Pentagon correspondent who asked, \u201cDoes that mean we expect to use American military force against the Assad regime in the short term to defend the FSA forces we have trained?\u201d Kirby said, \u201cAgain, that call must come from the White House.\u201d White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest declined to answer the same question, saying only that \u201cwe don\u2019t comment on ongoing military operations.\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC), in a joint press conference with Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), noted that \u201cthis sort of uncertainty and indecision is precisely what we have been warning against. It emboldens our enemies and makes our allies question what little credibility we have left.\u201d\n\nAnkara, Turkey, October 17, 2014 \u2014 In what was supposed to be a secret meeting between senior U.S. military officials and leaders of the Free Syrian Army in the town of Ceylanpinar in southern Turkey, a member of an FSA colonel\u2019s security team turned his weapon on the American contingent, killing two, including a U.S. Army major involved in coordinating training of \u201cmoderate\u201d rebel forces by the U.S. military. Three other Americans were injured, one critically, before the terrorist infiltrator was killed by shots fired by both FSA and American soldiers. President Obama, at a joint press conference while meeting with the premier of Bermuda, said he did not have enough information about the event to comment about it specifically but added, \u201cWe are counting on our friends in the moderate Syrian groups to uphold their part of our mutual agreement.\u201d The president and premier then enjoyed a round of golf at the exclusive Mid Ocean Club where they were joined by club regular, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Deputy Undersecretary of State Aymin Tudiep (known for his controversial comments about \u201cthe Zionist entity\u201d) will receive the caskets of the fallen in a brief untelevised ceremony at Joint Base Andrews on Thursday. Senator John McCain remarked, \u201cThis tragic but isolated event must not deter us from working with our good friends in the FSA.\u201d\n\nMosul, Iraq, October 20, 2014 \u2014 Nearly a week after U.S.-trained and U.S.-equipped FSA forces were attacked by the Syrian Air Force, the United States flew its first military mission over Syria in support of an advancing FSA column. The Pentagon said it did not know whether the FSA soldiers were moving against an Assad regime position or an ISIS position, nor whether the FSA\u2019s assault was successful. As widely reported in recent weeks, no member of President Obama\u2019s \u201c40-country coalition\u201d has a single soldier on the ground in Syria and therefore details of the battle remain spotty. To the east, following President Obama\u2019s reversal on a position of \u201cno boots on the ground,\u201d the U.S. presence in Iraq has been reduced due to the Obama administration\u2019s sending another 525 U.S. military personnel to West Africa to help with that region\u2019s Ebola outbreak. Local Kurdish commanders have said that lack of American attention is hampering progress against ISIS in northern Iraq. In Sierra Leone, two American soldiers have died from the Ebola virus and three others are in intensive care, now being treated in an isolation facility at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany. Several wives of soldiers protested outside the White House gates, holding signs saying, \u201cOur husbands fight terrorists, not viruses!\u201d and \u201cThey\u2019re soldiers, not nurses.\u201d\n\nMosul, Iraq, October 21, 2014 \u2014 An American AC-130 Spectre gunship flying a support mission in Syria was shot down by an apparent shoulder-fired MANPADS missile. Neither the Assad regime nor ISIS has claimed responsibility for the downing of the aircraft. According to witnesses, one pilot appeared to have ejected before the airplane crashed and exploded but his whereabouts are unknown. Given the recent \u201cgreen-on-blue\u201d attack in Turkey and the fact that the FSA is known to possess a handful of MANPADS thought to have been smuggled from Libya via Turkey, the U.S. cannot rule out that the missile may have been fired by our \u201callies\u201d in the ongoing multi-faction war in Syria.\n\nMosul, Iraq, October 24, 2014 \u2014 A horrific video has appeared on YouTube showing the beheading and bodily mutilation of USAF Lt. Johnny Galvin, co-pilot of the AC-130 gunship that was shot down in Syria three days ago. A previously unknown group calling itself The Righteous Warriors of Allah claimed responsibility for the murder. Galvin was the only member of the crew believed to have survived the missile attack on the plane. Lt. Galvin is survived by his wife, Katy, 26, and their two-year-old daughter, Kylie.\n\nMosul, Iraq, October 26, 2014 \u2014 President Obama today announced a temporary cessation of U.S. military flights over Syria. Within hours, a large ISIS force attacked a key FSA compound just east of Rasafeh, Syria, overrunning the moderate rebel base and leaving a substantial cache of American weapons in the hands of ISIS terrorists. Speaking at a town hall meeting near Tucson, Senator John McCain (R-AZ) suggested that \u201cA surge has worked for us before. Perhaps it is worth considering again.\u201d\n\nWashington, D.C., October 31, 2014 \u2014 After days of withering criticism, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel offered his resignation today. At the daily White House briefing, Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, \u201cPresident Obama is extremely grateful for Secretary Hagel\u2019s service to his nation.\u201d A Senate Armed Services Committee staffer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the Committee is being told to expect President Obama\u2019s nominee to fill the position to be Dr. Ivory Tower, a liberal professor of history at Swarthmore College specializing in the late Ottoman Empire period in the Middle East. When asked about the likely nominee, noted military historian Victor Davis Hanson said, \u201cBeside the too-obvious coincidence of Professor Tower\u2019s name, her lack of understanding of the nature of warfare is exceeded only by her lack of real-world experience or substantial depth in any area of study or endeavor. In short, she is par for the course for this president, and a perfect fit for Swarthmore. While she\u2019s certainly not someone I would select to run our Defense Department, she\u2019s not likely to be a lot worse than the previous occupant of that office.\u201d\n\nLas Vegas, NV, November 4, 2014 \u2014 A few minutes after 9 PM local time here in Nevada, Senator Harry Reid called his Republican counterpart, Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY), to congratulate him on becoming the new Majority Leader after Republicans won a net seven seats to take a 52-48 majority in the United States Senate. In a brief statement, President Obama, vacationing in Hawaii and just finishing the 211th round of golf of his presidency, said, \u201cI look forward to working with the new Senate majority. But let me be clear: due to the intransigence of Republicans, Americans should continue to expect my administration to act primarily through executive branch actions. And Senator McConnell should know up front that I will veto any legislation that rolls back the progress we\u2019ve made in ensuring quality, affordable health care for all Americans.\u201d\n\nWashington, D.C., November 5, 2014 \u2014 The Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services has issued a report saying that the cost of Obamacare over the next decade will be at least $75 billion higher than previously estimated due to higher subsidies for former illegal immigrants and skyrocketing Medicaid and subsidy fraud. The report also states that the average wait time to see a specialist in the United States has risen to a new record of 22 days and that more than seven million Americans who switched to Obamacare plans no longer have access to their preferred doctors. Additionally, an estimated 1,150 abortions were performed in the first two months in FY2015 for women whose health coverage is subsidized by the federal government in violation of federal law, an executive order, and President Obama\u2019s explicit promises during the debate leading up to the party-line passage of the Affordable Care Act. Former Michigan Congressman Bart Stupak, a pro-life Democrat who supported Obamacare after being promised by the president that he would not allow government-subsidized abortions and who retired in 2010 (rather than face an almost certain election loss), said, \u201cI suppose I should have known better \u2014 Paul Ryan tried to tell me at the time \u2014 but it\u2019s clear to me now that President Obama lied to me. I\u2019m very sorry I believed him and failed the country.\u201d Senator Jerry Moran (R-KS), chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, questioned the timing of the report, noting, \u201cIf this had come out even 24 hours earlier, we might have won the Senate race in Alaska and had an even larger majority going forward.\u201d Press Secretary Josh Earnest said only that he had not had time to review the report.\n\nHope, Arkansas, November 12, 2014 \u2014 Former First Lady and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton announced her candidacy for the presidency of the United States today. Her campaign kick-off speech was remarkable for its persistent contrasts with \u2014 some might say insults of \u2014 President Obama, criticizing him on issues including Syria, Ukraine, the economy, immigration, tax reform, and Obamacare though details of what she would do differently were noticeably absent from her remarks. As rumors persist of increasing friction between the Clinton and Obama families, Mrs. Clinton feels little fear in criticizing a president whose poll numbers continue to drop due to public perception of administration failures in both foreign and domestic policy. However, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s own polling has been on a substantial downtrend following recent revelations about an apparent cover-up of the State Department\u2019s failures leading up to and during the September 2012 terrorist attack on U.S. compounds in Benghazi, Libya. She is nevertheless considered a slight favorite two years ahead of the next presidential election with no GOP front-runner clearly visible.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.4"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0da3\"", "article_summary": "Mosul, Iraq, October 26, 2014 \u2014 President Obama today announced a temporary cessation of U.S. military flights over Syria.\nIn a brief statement, President Obama, vacationing in Hawaii and just finishing the 211th round of golf of his presidency, said, \u201cI look forward to working with the new Senate majority.\nLocal Kurdish commanders have said that lack of American attention is hampering progress against ISIS in northern Iraq.\nShe is nevertheless considered a slight favorite two years ahead of the next presidential election with no GOP front-runner clearly visible.\nThree other Americans were injured, one critically, before the terrorist infiltrator was killed by shots fired by both FSA and American soldiers."}
