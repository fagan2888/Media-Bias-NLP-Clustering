Scientists say the confluence won't occur again for another 70,000 years, give or take a millennium.\n\nDana Gitell, a 37-year-old marketing manager for a Jewish nonprofit in Massachusetts, is the mind behind the mashup \"Thanksgivukkah.\"\n\n(If you think that's a mouthful, her other ideas were \"Thanksgiving-ukkah\" and \"Hanukkahgiving,\" both of which caused our spellchecker to sputter and die.)\n\nBut with the right portmanteau in place, the Thanksgivukkah idea caught fire faster than a deep-fried turkey.\n\nGitell is gathering an online album of Thanksgivukkah celebrations, and says she's received submissions from places like South Dakota and Anchorage, Alaska - outposts not typically known for having vibrant Jewish communities.\n\nEven rabbis from ultra-Orthodox sects like Chabad have jumped on board the Thanksgivukkah bandwagon.\n\n\"At first I didn't know how rabbis would respond to something as irreverent as a mashup,\" Gittel says, \"but they almost uniformly embraced it. It's completely kosher.\"\n\nWe don't know if the rabbis approve of everything on our list, because people are sorta going nuts. Must be that once-in-an-eon thing. But without further ado (and with a nod toward Adam Sandler's \"Eight Crazy Nights\"), here are eight ways to celebrate Thanksgivukkah.\n\n1. Light a menurkey\n\nLeave it to a fourth-grader to create the ultimate Thanksgivukkah icon.\n\nAsher Weintraub came up with the idea during a family trip to Florida last year. The little genius from New York City thought it'd be really cool to have a menorah, the nine-branched candelabrum used to mark Hanukkah, in the shape of a turkey.\n\nWeintraub created a Kickstarter account, raised $50,000, made a 3-D prototype and heroically fended off his father's attempt to rename the thing a \"menorkey.\" Nice job, kiddo.\n\nThe father in question, Anthony Weintraub, says he's sold between 6,000 and 7,000 menurkeys, including a few to famous finance experts and owners of National Football League teams.\n\n\"I'm beginning to think my life as a menorah salesman isn't over,\" says Anthony Weintraub.\n\n2. Make a nice Turbrisket\n\nLet's face it, Thanksgiving was getting pretty gonzo even before meeting Hanukkah. I mean, turducken? But Thanksgivukkah has taken meal mashups to a new level.\n\nYou've got your Turbrisket (turkey filled with brisket), your deep-fried turkey, your sweet potato latkes, your cranberry-stuffed knishes, your pumpkin kugel, your pecan pie rugelach - I could go on, but I'll get fat just by typing the rest of the list.\n\nMarlene Eldemire of Cincinnati says her family wanted to make the huge mashup menu Buzzfeed posted earlier this month.\n\n\"I told them they can go ahead and make it,\" Eldemire says with a laugh. \"There's no way.\"\n\nSo her family is settling for a few Hanukkah standbys like brisket that'll sit next to the turkey and sweet potatoes this Thursday.\n\n3. Deck the halls for the Challahday\n\nThis is another spot where people are getting really creative, says Kali Brodsky, editor of JewishBoston.com.\n\nThey're making pumpkin menorahs, Thanksgivukkah coloring books for kids, and table settings that mix and match Hanukkah and Thanksgiving themes.\n\nRabbi Rachel Silverman of Boston says she's decorating her table with Thanksgiving symbols (a cornucopia, pumpkins, harvest bouquet) and Hanukkah items (a menorah, gold-colored coins called \"gelt\").\n\nIf you're feeling lazy, Brodsky says, you can just print out the Thanksgivukkah place cards JewishBoston has created and set a place for Bubbe.\n\n4. Watch a really big dreidel spin down the streets of New York\n\nTo honor the confluence of Thanksgiving and Hanukkah, Macy's has created a 25-foot-tall, 21-foot-wide dreidel for its iconic parade.\n\nThe \"balloonicle\" (part balloon, part vehicle) will spin just like a real dreidel, and it's the first time the parade has included a Jewish symbol, according to Macy's.\n\n\"Inclusion of the dreidel balloonicle is indicative of both a nod to the rare occasion in which Hanukkah's first day falls on Thanksgiving and of the dreidel's inherent entertainment value,\" says Macy's spokesman Orlando Veras.\n\n5. Party like it's 165 BC (and 1621 CE)\n\nHanukkah, for those who need a refresher course, marks the miracle of the successful defense of the Jewish temple by the Maccabees, an army of Jewish rebels, against the Goliath-like Syrian-Greek army in 165 BC.\n\nOne day's supply of oil somehow lit the temple's menorah for eight days, and the rest is history.\n\nThe Jewish event and the Pilgrims' arrival in America are both celebrations of religious freedom, says Sherry Kuiper.\n\nAt Kuiper's synagogue, Temple Israel in Columbus, Georgia, the kids led a service in which they dressed up like the Maccabees and Pilgrims, traveled in a make-believe time machine, and celebrated Thanksgivukkah together.\n\nThe parallel isn't perfect, Kuiper acknowledges. After all, the Native Americans certainly don't celebrate Thanksgiving as the birth of their religious freedom.\n\nBut Thanksgivukkah offers a reminder that the more things change, the more some things - like the human need to express gratitude - stay the same, Kuiper said.\n\n6. Kvetch about Thanksgivukkah\n\nOkay, this one isn't exactly about celebrating.\n\nBut it must be acknowledged, some folks just aren't into the Thanksgivukkah spirit.\n\nThanksgiving was one of the few holidays on which interfaith families didn't have to explain to the kids \"why mom believes this and dad believes that,\" argues Allison Benedikt in a recent Slate column.\n\n\"I cannot tell you what a relief it is to have this one major holiday\u2014the best one!\u2014that isn\u2019t in some part about what I am and my husband is not (Jewish), or what he is and I\u2019m not (Christmas-celebrating),\" Benedikt says.\n\n(And for just the record, sweet and sour braised brisket with cranberry sauce is an abomination, she says.)\n\nJennie Rivlin Roberts, whose Judaica store, Modern Tribe, is selling Thanksgivukkah gear like hotcakes, says she understands some of the kvetching.\n\nBut a mashup of Thanksgiving and Hanukkah is so much better than the usual \"December dilemma,\" the overlap of the eight-day Jewish holiday and the cultural behemoth know as Christmas, Roberts says.\n\n\"With Thanksgivukkah, you're not really mixing two religions, so you can really go for it. People may say it's silly, and yeah, some of it is, but it's also full of fun and joy.\"\n\n7. Watch a rap battle between a turkey and a dreidel\n\nJulie Benko was stuck on the subway in New York City for two hours, and she was bored. So, she did what any sane person would do - she wrote a song about Thanksgivukkah.\n\nOK, Benko is not your average straphanger. She's something of a Broadway belle, having just returned from playing Cosette on a national tour of \"Les Miserables.\" But that doesn't mean it's any easier to find a rhyme for \"Thanksgivukkah.\"\n\nStill, Benko's klezmer-inspired tune has lots of YouTube competition.\n\nThere's the rap battle between a turkey and a dreidel sponsored by Manischewitz. (Yes, they rock it old shul.)\n\nThere's the slickly produced \"Oils: A Thanksgivukkah Miracle.\"\n\nAnd there's this cute little number from the the Kehillah Schechter Academy in Norwood, Massachusetts, called \"The Ballad of Thanksgivukkah.\"\n\n8. Watch a scary movie about stereotypes\n\nAfter all the candle-lighting and the decorating and eating and the kvetching and the singing, let's face it, you're probably going to be pretty tired.\n\nSo why not plop down on the couch to watch the trailer for a Thanksgivukkah-themed horror movie?\n\n\"Thanksgivukkah: The Movie\" is about a nice gentile family who find their Thanksgiving celebration invaded by a family of ultra-Orthodox Jews. Jokes about religious stereotypes ensue.\n\nWe don't know if the trailer, which is made by Jewish filmmakers, is completely kosher, but we guess there's enough time for the rabbis to sort it out in time for the next Thanksgivukkah.\n\nSo, that's it. We\"ll see you next Thanksgivukkah, in 70,000 years or so.
