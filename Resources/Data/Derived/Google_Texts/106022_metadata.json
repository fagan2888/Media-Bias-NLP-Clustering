They could, and did, help destroy presidential campaigns. The media took them seriously, reporting on their pronouncements as representative of a significant bloc of conservative Catholics. They were not legion; but they were powerful. They were the Christian right\u2019s smaller, more shadowy counterpart: the Catholic right wing.\n\nBut now, many of their leading spokesmen\u2014and they are almost all men\u2014have been discredited within a stunningly short period. Former lights of the Catholic right like Bill Donohue and Cardinal Raymond Burke have seen their clout dissipate almost overnight. How did this happen and what does it mean for progressive Catholic candidates eyeing 2016?\n\nMany on the right were the victims of their own rhetoric run amok. Catholic League President Bill Donohue is being widely pilloried for asserting in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attack that \u201cMuslims are right to be angry,\u201d and that Hebdo editor St\u00e9phane Charbonnier played a role in his own death. \u201cHad he not been so narcissistic, he may still be alive,\u201d Donohue said in a statement that horrified even fellow conservatives.\n\nDonohue, the leading proponent of the \u201cwar on Christmas\u201d and other ginned-up made-for-Fox-News controversies over supposedly anti-Catholic persecution, was the ringleader behind efforts to discredit John Kerry with people of faith during the 2004 presidential election. He attacked Mara Vanderslice, Kerry\u2019s first director of religious outreach, as an \u201cultra-leftist who consorts with anti-Catholic bigots\u201d because of her work with organizations like ACT UP, an AIDS advocacy group that criticized the Catholic Church\u2019s ban on condoms. The accusations spooked the Kerry campaign enough that they removed Vanderslice as head of outreach, even as Kerry, who is a committed Catholic, faltered in the polls with people of faith.\n\nHer replacement, minister Brenda Peterson, lasted all of eight days before Donohue got her fired for signing an amicus brief in support of removing \u201cunder God\u201d from the Pledge of Allegiance. The Kerry campaign, like many in the media, believed that Donohue spoke for a wide segment of conservative Catholics and kowtowed to his demands. In hindsight, Peterson said, they didn\u2019t understand that he was \u201ca partisan, a member of the religious right intent on discrediting people of faith who signed on with Kerry.\u201d\n\nCardinal Burke was another key player in smearing Kerry with Catholics. Shortly after it became apparent that Kerry would be the Democratic nominee, Burke began a national frenzy over pro-choice Catholics and the sacrament of communion when he asserted that he wouldn\u2019t give Kerry communion because of his support of abortion rights. Kerry never overcame the negative publicity of paparazzi clustered around his church on \u201cwafer watch,\u201d and pro-choice Catholic candidates from Colorado to New Jersey found themselves under attack by culture warrior bishops following Burke\u2019s lead.\n\nBut Burke was recently demoted by Pope Francis from his choice spot on the Vatican\u2019s high court, basically put out to pasture as patron of a Vatican charity. And he became a laughingstock earlier this month when he claimed that an overly \u201cfeminized\u201d church was responsible for everything from the shortage of alter boys to priests sexually abusing children.\n\nAustin Ruse, head of the Catholic Family & Human Rights Institute (C-FAM), has similarly been discredited. Ruse is the ringleader of efforts at the UN block funding and support for family planning and women\u2019s rights programs. He organized a bloc of conservative NGOs and countries to stall reproductive health initiatives in the name of thwarting \u201cradical feminists.\u201d Like Donohue, Ruse specialized in over-the-top rhetoric that backed \u201cpro-family\u201d Republicans. In 2001, he bragged about joking with a priest on the floor of the UN about taking out Hillary Clinton, \u201cand not on a date.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Once a major political force with the power to derail presidential campaigns, right-wing Catholicism is in decline", "title": "The Pope Francis revolution: Inside the catastrophic collapse of the Catholic right", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Once a major political force with the power to derail presidential campaigns, right-wing Catholicism is in decline", "title": "The Pope Francis revolution: Inside the catastrophic collapse of the Catholic right", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/18/the_pope_francis_revolution_inside_the_catastrophic_collapse_of_the_catholic_right/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/burke_francis_donohue.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Once a major political force with the power to derail presidential campaigns, right-wing Catholicism is in decline", "title": "The Pope Francis revolution: Inside the catastrophic collapse of the Catholic right", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/burke_francis_donohue.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Patricia Miller", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bill Donohue, Catholic Church, Christianity, Editor's Picks, Papacy, pope francis, Raymond Burke, Religion, Timothy Dolan", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf1bd\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Bill Donohue, Catholic Church, Christianity, Editor's Picks, Papacy, pope francis, Raymond Burke, Religion, Timothy Dolan, NewsFor years they struck fear in the hearts of progressive Catholic candidates.\nFormer lights of the Catholic right like Bill Donohue and Cardinal Raymond Burke have seen their clout dissipate almost overnight.\nThe media took them seriously, reporting on their pronouncements as representative of a significant bloc of conservative Catholics.\nThey were the Christian right\u2019s smaller, more shadowy counterpart: the Catholic right wing.\nThe Kerry campaign, like many in the media, believed that Donohue spoke for a wide segment of conservative Catholics and kowtowed to his demands."}
