It was a grass-roots effort: They invited kids to stay in their homes, until they invested in a house.\n\n\u00bb The 501(c)3 tax-exempt nonprofit reported income in 2014 of nearly $1.6 million from government grants, foundations\u2019 aid, corporate givers, community groups, individual donors and special events such as a golf outing and a dance competition gala.\n\n\u00bb Expenses last year totaled nearly $1.25 million \u2014 79 percent to client services, 15 percent to management and 6 percent to fundraising.\n\n\u00bb It has 19 full-time employees and 13 part-time employees.\n\n\u00bb In the past decade, YES has helped more than 5,800 young people. Last year it helped 1,800 individuals, many multiple times. That was an 80 percent increase over the previous year. The outreach center sees between 30 and 60 kids each day and 30 to 40 new kids each month.\n\n\u00bb The original YES house now is the agency\u2019s six-bed emergency shelter. YES opened its street outreach center in 1999, added a transitional living program and maternity home in 2008 and launched a mentoring project in 2012.\n\n\u00bb The outreach center serves an average of 650 hot meals a month without a stove or oven. Church groups and other civic organizations bring in food, and staffers keep it hot in roasters or reheat it in a microwave oven.\n\n\u00bb YES also operates a Safe Place hotline for youths in crisis. Various metropolitan area locations have signed on to be a Safe Place for young people who need an immediate place to get away from difficult and possibly dangerous situations. The number is 402-578-7233 (SAFE).", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "Many aren\u2019t homeless in the classic sense; they don\u2019t spend every night outdoors or in a shelter.
