Recons, specific trainings, it\u2019s all come together.\u201d\n\nThe last Australian to wear the yellow jersey was Simon Gerrans in 2013.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a one-hit wonder. I want to hold it for at least one more day,\u201d said Dennis, who took silver in the team pursuit at the 2012 Olympics.\n\nHis performance in sweltering heat that hit 36 degrees (97F) was even more impressive given that he beat two time trial world champions.\n\n\u201cI think being Australian and growing up in this heat may have been a bit of an advantage for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cMy specific training between 2-5 p.m. gets you used to that. I have been training in 40 (104F) degrees to get adapted to those conditions and that was the plan of the team \u2026 not to come in blind.\u201d\n\nThree-time world champ Tony Martin trailed five seconds behind in second place, and four-time world champ Fabian Cancellara was six seconds back in third.\n\n\u201cI wanted to win. Any other result is a bad one,\u201d Martin said. \u201cI feel that I couldn\u2019t handle the heat, especially in the second half where I felt weaker.\u201d\n\nNibali, who tried to counter the searing heat by warming up with ice cubes strapped to his back, finished 43 seconds behind Dennis in 22nd place.\n\n\u201cI felt good, and I\u2019m satisfied I gained time on the other top favorites,\u201d Nibali said.\n\nHe was seven seconds ahead of 2013 Tour champ Chris Froome (39th), 15 seconds up on two-time Tour winner Alberto Contador (46th), and 18 seconds ahead of Nairo Quintana (57th).\n\n\u201cIt was pretty tough out there for such a short course,\u201d Froome said. \u201cThe longer efforts are where my training is geared towards. That was hard but I\u2019m happy to have it out of the way.\u201d\n\nAfter his ride, Dennis climbed off his bike and watched with a nervous smile from the finish line as his rivals tried and failed to beat him.\n\nThey included Tom Dumoulin, who looked in great form but crossed the line eight seconds adrift in fourth.\n\n\u201cIt was just a waiting game,\u201d a relieved Dennis said. \u201cA stressful two hours, maybe too stressful.\u201d\n\nThe Netherlands\u2019 fourth largest city has 320,000 inhabitants, and most of them seemed to be lining the course route, squeezing next to each other behind railings, or leaning out of windows as they roared on each rider.\n\nThe only place where there were no fans was when riders went through a tunnel.\n\nThe noise level went from loud to deafening when Dumoulin \u2014 a Dutchman with a rather French sounding name \u2014 put his head down and pounded his pedals.\n\nAfter Dumoulin tried and failed, it was Cancellara\u2019s turn.\n\nCancellara used his slick handling skills to attack the corners, but the heat also took its toll on the Swiss rider, who crossed the finish line gasping for air.\n\nMeanwhile, Dutchman Lars Boom started the race despite questions raised over his testing results, and he finished in 23rd.\n\nPre-race tests on the Astana rider showed a low cortisol level, which can indicate cortisone doping but is not conclusive proof of doping.\n\n\u201cIt is important to apply the rules accurately,\u201d UCI president Brian Cookson said. \u201cNo rules of the UCI or the World Anti-Doping Agency have been broken so he\u2019s allowed to ride the Tour de France.\u201d\n\nThe race stays in the Netherlands for Sunday\u2019s second stage, which starts out from Utrecht before ending 166 kilometers (103 miles) later at the heart of the Zeeland Delta.\n\nCycling along the Dutch coastline promises to be tricky for riders, with heavy gusts and sprays.\n\nThe Tour swings into nearby Belgium on Monday.\n\nAP Sports Writer Samuel Petrequin in Utrecht, Netherlands contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Record-breaker Rohan Dennis wins 1st Tour de France stage in style", "title": "Record-breaker Rohan Dennis wins 1st Tour de France stage in style", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/04/record-breaker-rohan-dennis-wins-1st-tour-de-france-stage-in-style/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150704_113903_rohan-dennis.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150704_113903_rohan-dennis.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-04T11:36:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T14:43:26+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbe24\"", "article_summary": "AP Sports Writer Samuel Petrequin in Utrecht, Netherlands contributed to this report.\nUTRECHT, Netherlands \u2014 Rohan Dennis won the first stage of the Tour de France in record speed in the individual time trial on Saturday, while defending Tour champion Vincenzo Nibali gained some precious time on his main rivals.\nDennis powered along the 14-kilometer (8.6-mile) flat and windy urban circuit through cycling-mad Utrecht in 14 minutes, 56 seconds.\n\u201cThere\u2019s still emotions going on,\u201d said a thrilled Dennis, who previously held the world hour record when covering a distance of 52.49 kilometers in February.\nRecons, specific trainings, it\u2019s all come together.\u201dThe last Australian to wear the yellow jersey was Simon Gerrans in 2013."}
