We have adjusted our methods with the new technology,\u201d Rebeca Mi\u00f1ambres, a project director of the Spanish company, told the press conference.\n\nThat company, a leader in next-generation sequencing and its bioinformatic analysis, worked up the database that contains all the data from different areas of the project that will serve for future research.\n\n\u201cThe main achievement has been to show that the use of these new omics technologies eliminates much of the complexity of the process and also the time, because using classic procedures would have taken us years,\u201d Mi\u00f1ambres said, adding that \u201cthe technology used can be valid for more industries than pharmaceuticals.\u201d\n\nVenomics is a project financed by the European Commission with a budget of 6 million euros ($6.8 million), and with the participation of institutions like Belgium\u2019s University of Liege, the Portuguese company and leader in molecular biology NZYTech, and the Danish pharmaceutical company Zealand Pharma.
