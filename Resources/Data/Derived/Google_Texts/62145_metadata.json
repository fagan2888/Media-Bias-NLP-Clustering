As the ovaries curb production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone in the years leading up to menopause and afterwards, women can experience symptoms ranging from irregular periods and vaginal dryness to mood swings and insomnia.\n\nVaginal dryness and painful intercourse are symptoms thought to result from atrophy of vaginal tissues because of falling estrogen levels. HRT has been shown to improve these symptoms by rebuilding vaginal walls.\n\nBefore the WHI study raised concerns about HRT, millions of women took Prempro, a pill combining progestin and estrogen, or Premarin, an estrogen-only pill. Pfizer Inc. acquired Wyeth, the maker of Premarin and Prempro, in 2009. Warren has served as a consultant to Pfizer, but she said the study was designed and conducted without input from the company.\n\nFor the study, Warren and colleagues studied vaginal estrogen use and sexual health in 310 women in New York City who were born between 1938 and 1953 and had used HRT for at least five years.\n\nWhile about 36 percent of women who stopped HRT used vaginal estrogen, so did around 17 percent of women who continued HRT, the study found.\n\nOverall, roughly a quarter of women in the study used vaginal estrogen.\n\nThe researchers acknowledge that the study is limited by its small size and the fact that participants were generally healthy, highly educated women with normal weight, so the results may not generalize to other groups.\n\nEven so, the findings suggest that some women may benefit from vaginal estrogen whether or not they use HRT, the authors conclude.\n\n\u201cVaginal estrogen is safer because very little if any estradiol gets into the blood stream,\u201d Dr. Michael Thomas, a researcher in reproductive endocrinology and infertility at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, said by email.\n\nLubricants may help make sex less painful for women after menopause, but this alternative can\u2019t work like estrogen to improve the mucous lining of the vagina and make bleeding and abrasions or tearing less likely during intercourse, added Thomas, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\n\nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/1Ng3Z4t Menopause, online August 8, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "vaginal, estrogen", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A small U.S. study suggests among women who don\u2019t take hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) after menopause, and even some who do, vaginally applied estrogen may help ease dryness and painful intercourse.", "title": "Vaginal Estrogen Linked To Improved Sexual Health For Some Women", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/vaginal-estrogen-linked-improved-sexual-health-some-women-351666", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/09/vaginal-estrogen.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A small U.S. study suggests among women who don\u2019t take hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) after menopause, and even some who do, vaginally applied estrogen may help ease dryness and painful intercourse.", "title": "Vaginal Estrogen Linked To Improved Sexual Health For Some Women", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/vaginal-estrogen-linked-improved-sexual-health-some-women-351666", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/09/vaginal-estrogen.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/09/vaginal-estrogen.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-09-09T10:16:08-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-09T10:16:07-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A small U.S. study suggests among women who don\u2019t take hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) after menopause, and even some who do, vaginally applied estrogen may help ease dryness and painful intercourse."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce748\"", "article_summary": "While about 36 percent of women who stopped HRT used vaginal estrogen, so did around 17 percent of women who continued HRT, the study found.\nWomen were most likely to use the vaginal estrogen if they reported pain during sex, and if they had stopped HRT, the study found.\nEven so, the findings suggest that some women may benefit from vaginal estrogen whether or not they use HRT, the authors conclude.\nOverall, roughly a quarter of women in the study used vaginal estrogen.\nVaginal dryness and painful intercourse are symptoms thought to result from atrophy of vaginal tissues because of falling estrogen levels."}
