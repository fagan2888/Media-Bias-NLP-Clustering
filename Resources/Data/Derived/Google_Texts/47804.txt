Every year, the comedy writers at the Republican National Committee come up with a batch of clever Valentine’s Day cards that poke fun at folks, usually Democrats. My favorite this year is “If you like this Valentine, you can keep it” above a photo of a laughing President Obama. Look, despite the good news on health-care enrollment, you have to laugh to keep from cryin’ when it comes to some aspects of the Affordable Care Act. But one of the snarky cards I didn’t find terribly funny. It’s the one of Russian President Vladimir Putin that reads “I’m Putin the moves on you.”

Cute, yet troubling. That devilish smirk comes off as sinister in light of the homophobic statutes he signed into law that criminalize the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Russians and in light of the violent treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Russians that anti-gay groups feel emboldened to video and disseminate. Thus, the moves Putin is putting on LGBT Russians are more accurately described as unwanted advances.
