U.S. job search website CareerCast.com has ranked the job of actuary as the number one job of 2015.

The website reported that “job satisfaction contributes to the No. 1 ranking of actuary in 2015. So, too, does the career’s positive hiring outlook and high average pay” of $94,209. “The anticipated demand for actuaries is due in part to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act,” the website added.

An actuary interprets statistics to determine probabilities of accidents, sickness, and death, and loss of property from theft and natural disasters. The top job was followed by audiologist (rank 2), mathematician, statistician, biomedical engineer, data scientist, dental hygienist, software engineer, occupational therapist, with computer systems analyst rounding out the top 10.

Insurance underwriter ranked #78 and insurance agent ranked #155.

“I’ve never met an actuary who said they didn’t love what they do,” said Tonya B. Manning, chief actuary at Buck Consultants of Xerox in Winston-Salem, N.C., on the website. “I work with interesting people every day, from CFOs and attorneys to international clients, and what I do each day is different from what I did the day before. And since I love solving problems that benefit society, it’s really a wonderful career.”

The website used core metrics to determine its rankings, including favourable hiring outlook, stress, environment and income, the latter of which definitely ranks well in the mathematics field. Actuaries, statisticians, mathematicians and data scientists earn wages waging from $79,000 to $124,000 (U.S.) annually, though an advanced education is typically required.
