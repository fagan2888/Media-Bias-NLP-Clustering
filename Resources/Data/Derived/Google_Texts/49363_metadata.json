Jay Carney\u2018s wife, ABC News personality and working mom Claire Shipman. Carney\u2019s two beautiful children are also profiled in the piece, but the profile itself is largely irrelevant.\n\nWhat is worthy of dissection are the three featured images that add value to the profile. And by \u201cvalue,\u201d we mean guffaws galore.\n\nAnd you thought Washington cared about the crisis of starvation in East Africa. Sure, they will tell you they care, but $750 in produce, mounds of breakfast meats, at least 60 pancakes, an entire loaf of bread, what appears to be a plate of just butter, and an overflowing platter of pastries say something quite different.\n\nOf course, the cautiously placed blueberries on the counter \u2014 the only evidence that a morning meal which would have made pre-revolutionary Versailles blush has been prepared in this immaculate kitchen \u2014 suggests this image was carefully staged.\n\nThat, and the young man\u2019s perfectly fried egg, which has been captured in it\u2019s perfection mid-flip. A maneuver which, by the way, no one would ever perform because the egg\u2019s impact on the pan \u2014 presuming you were skillful enough to catch it \u2014 would send yolk rocketing everywhere. But, I know. This is art.\n\nSpeaking of art, even the decorations are perfect. Just look at the\u2026 wait\u2026 what\u2019s this:\n\nOf course. Why wouldn\u2019t this administration, which regularly bristles over being accused of embracing socialist policies, hire as its spokesperson a man who decorates his home in vintage Red Army propaganda. Good to know that the Carneys have elevated dorm room decor to the level of refinement that Washington demands. That\u2019s a rather bourgeois frame, comrade. Let\u2019s hope no one reports you to the local commissar.\n\nLater in the profile, we learn that Carney\u2019s children live in the fantasy that Tom Hanks\u2018 inner child manifested in the movie Big. In the event that anyone ever played this gigantic Jenga tower competitively, it would likely result in permanent injuries when the 70 pounds of sharp, wooden blocks came cascading down on an unsuspecting child.\n\nThe toy, however, is not the focus of this image. The stylish casual attire, however, is. Washingtonian Mom provides the reader with a breakdown of every item of clothing; what it cost, and where you, too, can purchase it.\n\nBut the last image of the White House press secretary is so droll, so tongue-in-cheek, it makes one wonder if Washingtonian Mom\u2018s team wasn\u2019t half trying to provide conservatives with meme fodder.\n\nIn this candid setting, we see Jay Carney getting the grilling of his life. Maybe these practice sessions are the key to Carney\u2019s longevity in his role as press secretary. One has to imagine that the tenacity of this group\u2019s follow-ups about extending bed time have to rival the White House press corps\u2019 interest in the Affordable Care Act\u2019s enrollment figures, the rules of engagement governing drone warfare, or the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s coordination with liberal groups and Democratic congressional staffers.\n\nMaybe we\u2019re reading too much into these images. Maybe we\u2019re just being scolds and sticklers, and we should focus less on the supplemental art that accompanies this profile and more on the actual profile itself.\n\nWhere to begin. \u201cJay\u2019s Suit, $895\u2026\u201d\n\nOh, forget it.\n\nUPDATE: Via @RBPundit, that last photo was apparently a rush job. In the image, Carney is surrounded by shelves and shelves of the same books. The photo-shopping was so hurried, in fact, that Carney\u2019s son\u2019s finger was never removed:\n\n[Correction: This article previously identified the magazine as Washingtonian Monthly.
