The IRS said it had corrected two dozen of them, but the new audit found just 14 of them were actually fixed, leaving dozens of weaknesses still to be resolved.\n\nPart of the problem is that the IRS hasn\u2019t even always followed its own guidelines for assessing risks and creating information security plans, the GAO said.\n\nSEE ALSO: IRS blames Obamacare for shoddy customer service\n\nThe findings forced the GAO to list the IRS as having \u201ca significant deficiency\u201d in financial reporting systems.\n\nAmong the specific problems investigators found were that the IRS was lax in requiring good passwords and forcing employees to change them frequently and the agency allowed too many people to ave access to critical tax-payment data.\n\nInvestigators also said the agency didn\u2019t cancel some accounts in a timely fashion \u2014 with one still active, though it was supposed to have been removed in April 2009.\n\n\u201cAs a result of these weaknesses, IRS had reduced ability to control who was accessing its systems and data,\u201d the GAO said.\n\nThe GAO said some progress had been made since its initial report in 2014, and the IRS took heart from that.

He said that\u2019s part of the reason the agency is answering just 43 percent of taxpayers\u2019 phone calls this tax season.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The IRS sometimes uses old software without key security patches that leave its computer systems vulnerable and could endanger taxpayers' private information, the Government Accountability Office said Thursday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The IRS sometimes uses old software without key security patches that leave its computer systems vulnerable and could endanger taxpayers\u2019 private information, the Government Accountability Office said Thursday.", "title": "IRS botches computer security, risks taxpayer info: audit", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/19/audit-finds-irs-botches-computer-security/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/04/11/irs.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/04/11/irs.jpg", "description": "The IRS sometimes uses old software without key security patches that leave its computer systems vulnerable and could endanger taxpayers' private information, the Government Accountability Office said", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "IRS botches computer security, risks taxpayer info: audit"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Business Finance, Internal Revenue Service, Government Accountability Office"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1046\"", "article_summary": "Part of the problem is that the IRS hasn\u2019t even always followed its own guidelines for assessing risks and creating information security plans, the GAO said.\n\u201cAs a result of these weaknesses, IRS had reduced ability to control who was accessing its systems and data,\u201d the GAO said.\n\u201cThe security and privacy of taxpayer information and the integrity of our financial systems continues to be sound,\u201d he said.\nThe IRS sometimes uses old software without key security patches that leave its computer systems vulnerable and could endanger taxpayers\u2019 private information, the Government Accountability Office said Thursday.\nSEE ALSO: IRS blames Obamacare for shoddy customer serviceThe findings forced the GAO to list the IRS as having \u201ca significant deficiency\u201d in financial reporting systems."}
