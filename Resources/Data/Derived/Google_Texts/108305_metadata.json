You wouldn\u2019t know that listening to Donald Trump, who now claims to have won the race with a plurality of votes (and more importantly, delegates).\n\nBecause if Trump truly believed he was home-free, wouldn\u2019t he reach out to the many, many elements of the party that he has spent months savaging?\n\nBut as Amanda Carpenter pointed out in the Conservative Review, Trump seems rather to be pivoting to a general election strategy, and voicing more centrist positions - without ever having expressed any conservative positions. In fact, he doesn\u2019t seem interested in solidifying the conservative vote.\n\n\u201cWe have now reached the pinnacle of Donald Trump\u2019s primary campaign,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe is the only candidate left standing who can mathematically become the nominee on the first ballot of the Republican convention in July. So why is it still so hard for so many Republicans to support him? Why does it feel downright dirty to even entertain the possibility of slapping a Trump bumper sticker on your car?\u201d\n\nThe reasons - and there are many of them - can be summed up in one notion. Trump disdains conservatism and the principles it\u2019s founded upon - limited government, the Constitution, freedom and accountability.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s willing to raise taxes,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cHe thinks he can order military men and women to engage in ISIS-like torture methods. He is utterly unable to defend the pro-life cause. He supports ethanol subsidies. He has given money to Planned Parenthood and Obamacare-supporting Democrats. He wants to change free speech laws to make it harder for people to criticize him. He supported both the bank and auto bailouts. The list goes on.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s really only one conclusion to draw here.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want help from committed conservatives,\u201d Carpenter wrote. \u201cHe\u2019s making no effort to court them probably because he doesn\u2019t want them. Why else would he skip CPAC? Or so many of the other activist-driven state party conventions where delegates are selected? To him, the conservative organizations that have thrown their heart and soul behind elected Tea Party insurgents are just as bad as the Bush boys. To him, they\u2019re all part of the establishment and he\u2019s ready to throw them all out. Just forget them all.\u201d\n\nTrump will be doomed in the general election, if he\u2019s the nominee.\n\nNo one with his negatives can win, and that\u2019s before the Democrats unleash the tidal wave of opposition research they\u2019ve been collecting on his frauds, his failings and his ties to the mob.\n\nBut he is also doomed by his disdain of many in the party he so recently joined.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no room in the Trump Party for the conservative activists who believe in the quaint principles of liberty with those silly tri-corner hats. It\u2019s all about Trump\u2019s ego and the deals he makes. If Trump felt any differently, he would have at least tried extending an olive branch to conservatives.\u201d\n\nThankfully, there\u2019s still time for the conservatives in the party to prevent the Trump disaster that seems so imminent.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "TylerPaper.com", "description": "The Republican presidential primary is not over.
