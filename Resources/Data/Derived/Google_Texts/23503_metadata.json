Brian Rosenwald writes:\n\nIngraham and Levin openly embraced Cantor\u2019s primary rival, the obscure economics professor Dave Brat. Ingraham campaigned with Brat, hosted him on her show and relentlessly promoted his candidacy. After the race, she told POLITICO\u2019s Dylan Byers, \u201cI helped shine a light on a race where the establishment was vulnerable. I helped give Brat a platform that he was not getting through any other media outlet.\u201d Yet, in reality, this triumph was actually 25 years in the making.\n\nRosenwald suggests that talk radio hosts have a unique relationship with their listeners that allow them to be an authority on issues of the day. These hosts have on special guests, take calls from other listeners, and build relationships that span years, especially nationally-syndicated hosts like Ingraham, Levin, and Rush Limbaugh.\n\nAnd though their role in general elections is overstated, Rosenwald argues (see Obama\u2019s 2008 and 2012 victories despite talk radio efforts), these figures are able to influence Republican primary battles between incumbent Establishment Republicans and insurgent conservative challengers.\n\nThese hosts are able to raise the national profile for conservative challengers, which in turn allows them to raise national money. Take, for instance, Scott Brown\u2019s 2010 special election for U.S. Senate in Massachusetts. Rosenwald writes:\n\nDuring Scott Brown\u2019s underdog campaign for Senate in a 2010 special election, his aides noticed clusters of donations totaling $15,000-$20,000 coming in from communities on the other side of the country at odd times of day. They realized that these donors were listening to nationally syndicated talk radio programs, promoting Brown on the other on tape delay.\n\nCertainly, Brown is no conservative, but his election was important to conservatives because he was going to be the 41st vote to stop Obamacare.\n\nIt\u2019s not only nationally syndicated talkers, though. Local talk radio show hosts also bolster conservative challengers. Rosenwald continues:\n\nIn the final few days of the campaign, both Brat and Cantor appeared on WRVA, Richmond\u2019s news and talk station, which features local hosts in drive time, with nationally syndicated conservative talkers during the rest of the day, several times. As Brat was the lesser-known challenger, these appearances benefitted him far more. They allowed him to disseminate his message and counter claims in Cantor\u2019s negative advertising, which undermined the advantage provided by Cantor\u2019s fundraising prowess (though Brat argues that Cantor\u2019s negative advertising boosted his profile).\n\nIn addition to the right training, as this author highlighted last week, it\u2019s important to raise the profile of the conservative challenger, particularly in a race against someone in Establishment leadership. Technological advancements allow conservative challengers to nationalize their races, making it easier to raise money and awareness of the race.\n\nFinally, Rosenwald notes:\n\nHere\u2019s another way to look at this dynamic: In effect, it\u2019s primary elections themselves\u2014made all the more important due to partisan gerrymandering that has left only 35 truly competitive seats in the U.S. House of Representatives\u2014that give talk radio its power to shape politics and policy. Until Republican candidates fear their Democratic opponents more than they fear a challenge from their right, the Laura Ingrahams and Mark Levins of the world will notch victory after victory in the policy wars.\n\nThe challenge for conservatives is to put these candidates on the radars of talk radio show hosts, both local and nationally syndicated. Doing so will give them an opportunity to topple the safest of incumbents.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "conservative,Laura Ingraham,Mark Levin,Republican Party,Rush Limbaugh,Talk Radio,Politics,News,Blog,Current,Alternative,Libertarian,Freedom,Election,Nonpartisan,Ron Paul", "DC.Title": "Talk radio hosts can propel conservative challengers to victory over establishment Republicans", "robots": "index,follow", "copyright": "(c) 2005-2013 United Liberty", "description": "Laura Ingraham POLITICO Magazine has a thorough report about talk radio show hosts Laura Ingraham and Mark Levin&#8217;s role in Dave Brat&#8217;s victory over Eric Cantor last week and about talk radio&#8217;s role in winning elections, in"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcae16\"", "article_summary": "They realized that these donors were listening to nationally syndicated talk radio programs, promoting Brown on the other on tape delay.\nThe challenge for conservatives is to put these candidates on the radars of talk radio show hosts, both local and nationally syndicated.\nRosenwald suggests that talk radio hosts have a unique relationship with their listeners that allow them to be an authority on issues of the day.\nLocal talk radio show hosts also bolster conservative challengers.\nPOLITICO Magazine has a thorough report about talk radio show hosts Laura Ingraham and Mark Levin\u2019s role in Dave Brat\u2019s victory over Eric Cantor last week and about talk radio\u2019s role in winning elections, in general."}
