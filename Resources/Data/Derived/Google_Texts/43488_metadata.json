But he can bring ... people who have been disenfranchised [into politics].\"\"The campaign is just ramping up, and he has a long way to go, and I believe the candidates grow and develop during the course of a yearlong campaign and voters are able to see them for what they are and then make an informed decision.\"Meanwhile, in a separate interview with Catsimatidis, former New York Gov. George Pataki said he can't yet endorse the presumptive nominee, and is waiting to hear stronger positions on national security and Obamacare.His remarks begin at about the\"Trump needs to articulate a number of thoughtful positions on the issues for me to be able to endorse him,\" Pataki said. \"\"He has yet to articulate ... a very strong policy towards how he's going to keep America safe and go after radical Islam.\"Added Pataki:\"Obamacare's the worst law passed in my lifetime. On this, Donald Trump has been all over the lot. I'd love to hear him say, 'I'm going to repeal Obamacare, and I'm going to work to replace it with market-based alternative solutions. If he does those things, I'd be happy to support him.\u201dPataki dropped out of the 2016 White House race last December.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Huntsman, Pataki, Trump, Cats Roundtable", "pubdate": "2016-05-22T16:34:45", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Two former governors and GOP presidential candidates said Sunday they continue to have reservations about the party's presumptive nominee.\r\nIn separate interviews with businessman and host John Catsimatidis on  The Cats Roundtable,  former Utah Gov.
