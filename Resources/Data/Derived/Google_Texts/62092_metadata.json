And who they\u2019re made for, which is, for the corporations or for all of us?\"\n\nBelow is an interview with Stiglitz, followed by a transcript:\n\nAMY GOODMAN: I mean, what\u2019s very interesting is you have Bernie Sanders really stressing inequality. This pushes Hillary Clinton to do this, because he has gained so much momentum and drawn tens of thousands of peoples to his rally. On the Republican side, you have, in some areas, Donald Trump sounding more liberal than Hillary Clinton\u2014immediately came out against these trade deals.\n\nJOSEPH STIGLITZ: Yeah, so, in a sense, what you see both in the Republican and Democratic Party is a sense that something is wrong. You know, America was the first middle-class society. We\u2019re about to become the first society that ceases to be a middle-class society. The basic requirements of being a member of the middle class\u2014the ability to send your kids to school, a secure retirement\u2014all those things are being put in jeopardy. And one of the things we talk about in Rewriting the Rules is how we can get those back. But what you\u2019re seeing on both sides is a sense of anger. Now, I think that both of the Democratic candidates have put forward credible ways of dealing with it. And there\u2019s going to be a long discussion. The problem is that on the Republican side there\u2019s anger, but it\u2019s basically inchoate. You know, it\u2019s basically tax reforms that actually rewrite the rules in the wrong way, making things even more unequal than we have and the numbers not adding up.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: In Part 1 of our conversation, we talked about theTPP, the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal that President Obama has really championed. What would\u2014what grade, as a college professor, would you give President Obama, who actually went to Columbia University, where you\u2019re a professor, when it comes to these issues? You\u2019ve called the trade deal a \"charade.\"\n\nJOSEPH STIGLITZ: Well, unfortunately, you know, he\u2019s done some things that\u2014he did not support some of the basic reforms in the financial sector that I think were needed. TPP, I think, is a very big mistake. On the other\u2014\n\nAMY GOODMAN: It means corporations control trade, as opposed to democratic societies and their governments?\n\nJOSEPH STIGLITZ: Exactly, and particularly as we move away from lowering tariffs, which is what the old trade deals\u2014these are about regulations. And yes, regulations maybe have\u2014so many regulations have to be harmonized, they have to be changed. But you can\u2019t leave that up to corporations. And with a changing world, you can\u2019t lock in the current regulatory structure, which is what TPP attempts to do. So\u2014\n\nAMY GOODMAN: For people who don\u2019t understand TPP, explain who makes the decisions around these global trade rules. This will control what? Forty percent of the global economy?\n\nJOSEPH STIGLITZ: Yeah. And the irony is that the president came out and said, \"This is about who makes the trade rules\u2014China or the United States?\" But I think the big issue is, this is about who makes the rules of trade\u2014the American people, our democratic process, or the corporations? And who they\u2019re made for, which is, for the corporations or for all of us?\n\nAMY GOODMAN: You don\u2019t think President Obama understands that?\n\nJOSEPH STIGLITZ: No.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: You don\u2019t think he understands it, or he\u2014\n\nJOSEPH STIGLITZ: I think he wants to chalk up some kind of an achievement, i.e. he can\u2019t pass anything through Congress because the Republicans won\u2019t allow him, so he has to get something that the Republicans want. And they want a trade agreement. The provisions about\u2014in the TPP about investment, about\u2014are the kinds of provisions that were number one in the agenda of the Business Roundtable. And so\u2014\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And explain what the Business Roundtable is.\n\nJOSEPH STIGLITZ: This is the group of the big\u2014America\u2019s biggest corporations.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: It\u2019s not the mom-and-pop stores.\n\nJOSEPH STIGLITZ: It\u2019s not the mom-and-pop stores. So this is about big business being able to protect themselves. But let me make it clear: It\u2019s not about property rights, as we usually understand it. You know, what the USTR says, they say, \"Well, we\u2019re dealing with countries where we can\u2019t trust the way the legal system works, so we have to put these protections in, because these countries just can\u2019t be trusted.\" We\u2019re insisting on the same kind of provision in our trade agreements with Europe, with Germany. And the Germans are saying, you know, \"We have just as good a legal system as yours, and why are you trying to go beyond our legal system?\" I mean, for instance, there, they care about GMO. You know, they care a lot about various kinds of\u2014\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Right, genetically modified organisms.\n\nJOSEPH STIGLITZ: And they say, you know, \"We want at least the consumers be informed. They can make a choice.\" And if this gets passed, if you pass the regulation that says you have to display, and Americans\u2014and people say, \"I\u2019m not going to buy a product that\u2019s GMO,\" they can be sued, because of\u2014\n\nAMY GOODMAN: If you put the label on, just informing people that there may be GMOs in this product, you can be sued.\n\nJOSEPH STIGLITZ: You could be sued. Now, we don\u2019t know\u2014let me make it clear: We don\u2019t know all the provisions. They kept it secret. But you have to say\u2014\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And how do they get away with keeping it secret?\n\nJOSEPH STIGLITZ: Well, that is the amazing thing. You know, this was\u2014their argument again is they have\u2014you know, these are negotiations, very complex, and if everything were open, everybody would be\u2014you know, it would be a mess. But they haven\u2019t really kept it secret, because they\u2019ve talked to the corporations. The corporations have been there at the table saying, \"Well, it\u2019s really important for us to have this provision. It\u2019s really important for us to have that provision.\" But ordinary citizens have not been at the table. You know, the only way that we know what\u2019s going on is leaked documents. And some of the links come from other countries, where there\u2019s a stronger democratic commitment to more transparency. But our government has been keeping it much more secret.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: We\u2019re talking to Joe Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, who\u2019s written the new book, Rewriting the Rules of the American Economy. What would rejuvenate worker power, labor power, union power in this country?\n\nJOSEPH STIGLITZ: Well, all these things are about rewriting the rules. I mean, our basic idea is that over the past 35 years we\u2019ve rewritten the rules in ways that have weakened labor power, increased the financial sector power. There\u2019s been a rebalancing of the power in the wrong way. And TPP\u2014\n\nAMY GOODMAN: What happened 35 years ago? Reagan?\n\nJOSEPH STIGLITZ: President Reagan, but he was part of a zeitgeist, because you see it in Europe going on at the same time. And let me just say, TPP is another example of rewriting the rules in the wrong way. It\u2019s a continuation of that trend that began back in around 1980 that has increased the imbalance and made things more difficult. So what we need to do now is to rewrite the rules once again, but this time, you know, we\u2019re in the 21st century: It\u2019s not going back exactly to where we were before 1980; it has to be modernized. But realize that we rewrote the rules in ways that destroyed the kind of balance of power that we had.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: So if you were in charge of writing a Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact that helped people, the vast majority of people, what would be the rules of this TPP?\n\nJOSEPH STIGLITZ: Well, one thing that we haven\u2019t talked about is\u2014one of the most controversial aspects is access to generic medicines. You know, ordinary people need to be able to get medicines at a low price. We struck a balance in the United States in the Hatch-Waxman Act, where we said, \"OK, Big Pharma has to be able to get some returns for their investments and research.\" But\u2014mostly research really goes on in the universities, let\u2019s be clear, and at NIH government-sponsored research labs. But the generic medicines, which are now more than 80 percent of all drugs, bring the prices down. That\u2019s the competition that makes the market work. Well, we struck that balance, but in this trade agreement they\u2019re trying to restrike the balance in favor of Big Pharma. You know, this is\u2014we were talking about President Obama\u2019s legacy. One of his big legacy is Obamacare, and that\u2019s supposed to bring access to medicine. But when you\u2014TPP will go in exactly the wrong way, because it will restrict access to medicine for many countries around the world. So, that\u2019s one thing.\n\nBut take the investment agreement. I would do two things. First, it seems to me that the conditions under which you can sue are wrong. If a country passes a regulation, whether it\u2019s for health, safety, the environment or managing the economy, you shouldn\u2019t be able to sue. These are called regulatory takings. And repeatedly our courts have said it\u2019s the basic right of a country to design rules to protect their citizens, protect their economy, protect their environment. So the conditions under which you can sue are wrong. Who can bring a suit is wrong. It should be government to government, not corporations suing a government.\n\nAnd thirdly, the judicial process by which it\u2019s done, it shouldn\u2019t be in private courts. The most important\u2014one of the most important public functions is dispute resolution. When we created the WTO, we created an international panel for dispute resolution. We could do the same thing for investment agreements. But instead, they\u2019ve decided to go to very expensive private arbitration, rife with conflicts of interests, you know, so expensive that\u2014I referred earlier to the Uruguay, where Philip Morris is suing.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Altria, is it called?\n\nJOSEPH STIGLITZ: Altria, you know, the successor to Philip Morris. It\u2019s so expensive that Uruguay can\u2019t pay for its own defense. And Mayor Bloomberg, who is so concerned about smoking, is paying\u2014is contributing to the support of Uruguay to defend itself against Altria, which is just passing regulations to try to protect people\u2019s health.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Nobel Prize-winning economist Joe Stiglitz, author of Rewriting the Rules of the American Economy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "'This is about who makes the rules of trade\u2014the American people or the corporations.'", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Alternet", "description": "'This is about who makes the rules of trade\u2014the American people or the corporations.'", "title": "'A Very Big Mistake': Joseph Stiglitz Slams Obama for Pushing the TPP", "url": "http://www.alternet.org/economy/very-big-mistake-joseph-stiglitz-slams-obama-pushing-tpp", "image": "http://www.alternet.org/files/story_images/joseph_stiglitz-democracy_now.jpg", "type": "article"}, "dc": {"title": "&#039;A Very Big Mistake&#039;: Joseph Stiglitz Slams Obama for Pushing the TPP"}, "fb": {"page_id": 17108852506, "pages": 17108852506}, "google-site-verification": "-yUzdOYz6i2iShII0x_PYzsvnhQUG2f751funoPlCNM", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-12T17:56:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "'A Very Big Mistake': Joseph Stiglitz Slams Obama for Pushing the TPPJoseph Stiglitz.\nSo\u2014AMY GOODMAN: For people who don\u2019t understand TPP, explain who makes the decisions around these global trade rules.\nAs Congress debates the Trans-Pacific Partnership, we speak to Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz about the trade deal.\nJOSEPH STIGLITZ: Exactly, and particularly as we move away from lowering tariffs, which is what the old trade deals\u2014these are about regulations.\nAMY GOODMAN: You don\u2019t think he understands it, or he\u2014JOSEPH STIGLITZ: I think he wants to chalk up some kind of an achievement, i.e."}
