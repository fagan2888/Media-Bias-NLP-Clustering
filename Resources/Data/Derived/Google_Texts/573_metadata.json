And over the weekend, the U.S. announced that it would send a heavy icebreaker to free the ships \u2014 so, of course, as usual, you taxpayers will foot the bill.\n\nBut still more: media reports about the Russian-owned research ship carrying the global warmists have failed to note the passengers\u2019 mission. Instead, news organizations like Reuters say they left New Zealand on Nov. 28 \u201cto commemorate the 100th anniversary of an Antarctic journey led by Australian explorer Douglas Mawson.\u201d The AP peddled the same line, too.\n\nSPECIAL COVERAGE: Energy and Environment\n\nYet the real mission of the passengers came out anyway. The expedition\u2019s leader is Chris Turney, a \u201cclimate scientist\u201d who has set up a carbon refining company called Carbonscape, according to the website wattsupwiththat.com, self-touted as \u201cthe world\u2019s most viewed site on global warming and climate change.\u201d\n\nThe company, the site says, \u201chas developed technology to fix carbon from the atmosphere and make a host of green bi-products, helping reduce greenhouse gas levels.\u201d\n\nNational Geographic made it all very clear with the aptly titled report: \u201cWho\u2019s on That Russian Ship Stuck on Antarctic Ice? And Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe current crop of explorers are hoping to document some of the same data and compare them to Mawson\u2019s numbers, \u2018using the twist of modern technology,\u2019 Turney told National Geographic,\u201d the article said.\n\nThe last knife of irony: While they\u2019ve been stuck in the ice, a new report came out saying there is more ice on the Antarctica shelf than ever before. \u201cScientists at the British Antarctic Survey [BAS] say that the melting of the Pine Island Glacier ice shelf in Antarctica has suddenly slowed right down in the last few years, confirming earlier research which suggested that the shelf\u2019s melt does not result from human-driven global warming,\u201d the UK\u2019s The Register reported.\n\nSaid Pierre Dutrieux of the BAS: \u201cWe found ocean melting of the glacier was the lowest ever recorded, and less than half of that observed in 2010. This enormous, and unexpected, variability contradicts the widespread view that a simple and steady ocean warming in the region is eroding the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s why the media hasn\u2019t bothered to mention the expedition\u2019s real mission. It\u2019s embarrassing. As humiliating as those reports from the 1970s on the much-feared Global Cooling.\n\n\u201cUS Scientist Sees New Ice Age Coming,\u201d blared a Washington Post headline in 1971. \u201cThe world could be as little as 50 or 60 years away from a disastrous new ice age, a leading atmospheric scientist predicts,\u201d the paper said. Even The New York Times said \u201cClimate Changes Called Ominous.\u201d \u201cThere is a finite probability that a serious worldwide cooling could befall the Earth within the next hundred years.\u201d\n\nThey were wrong then, and they\u2019re wrong now. Yes, of course developed countries should do everything they can to reduce carbon emissions, but there is no global panic. After all, temperatures haven\u2019t risen since 1997 (scientists say). Some news orgs, especially in Britain, are beginning to tell a different story.\n\n\u201cGlobal warming? No, actually we\u2019re cooling, claim scientists,\u201d one September headline read in The Telegraph. \u201cDespite the original forecasts, major climate research centres now accept that there has been a \u2018pause\u2019 in global warming since 1997,\u201d said the lead.\n\nAs the United States shivers in a record cold snap fed by a \u201cpolar vortex\u201d (game time Sunday in Green Bay for the NFL playoffs was 3 degrees, with a windchill of -17!), perhaps its time to pay attention to the climatologists out there who hold that global warming is not settled science. Just over 100 years of definitive climate data can\u2019t shed much light on the 4.5-billion-year-old Earth.\n\nAnd last, there\u2019s this: Al Gore has reportedly bought not one, not two, but three homes near beaches. So he doesn\u2019t seem too worried about that coming sea-surge tsunami.\n\nAgain, you just can\u2019t make this stuff up.\n\n\u2022 Joseph Curl covered the White House and politics for a decade for The Washington Times and is now editor of the Drudge Report.
