Bernie Sanders (D-VT), in New Hampshire by double-digits. It should come as no surprise that Hillary isn\u2019t too pleased; mulling whom to possibly cut pending her more than likely defeat tomorrow night. Yet, the street goes both ways. Politico published a piece today, which used mostly unnamed sources, that indicated the Clinton staff is equally frustrated, especially with how the former first lady dragged her feet on the email controversy. Yet, Clinton could just add more staffers to make the ones she has a problem with irrelevant, but let's not kid ourselves about her potentially axing a few folks. After all, as the publication added, there was going to be some sort of Red Wedding event if Clinton lost New Hampshire back in 2008:\n\n\u201cThe Clintons are not happy, and have been letting all of us know that,\u201d said one Democratic official who speaks regularly to both. \u201cThe idea is that we need a more forward-looking message, for the primary \u2013 but also for the general election too\u2026 There\u2019s no sense of panic, but there is an urgency to fix these problems right now.\u201d [\u2026] The focus of their dissatisfaction in recent days is the campaign\u2019s top pollster and strategist Joel Benenson, whom one Clinton insider described as being \u201con thin ice,\u201d as the former first couple vented its frustrations about messaging following Clinton\u2019s uncomfortably close 0.25 percent win in last week\u2019s caucuses. Benenson, multiple staffers and operatives say, has been equally frustrated with the Clintons\u2019 habit of tapping a rolling cast of about a dozen outside advisers \u2013 who often have the candidate\u2019s ear outside the official channels of communication. The result is a muddled all-the-above messaging strategy that emphasizes different messages \u2013 and mountains of arcane policy proposals \u2013 in stark contrast to Bernie Sanders\u2019 punchy and relentless messaging on income inequality. [\u2026] But from the beginning, there have been deeper issues simmering within the cheerfully-decorated Brooklyn headquarters -- and much of that had to do with a disconnect between the candidate and her campaign. Over the summer while her campaign was bogged down in the email controversy, Clinton was deeply frustrated with her own staff, and vice versa. The candidate blamed her team for not getting her out of the mess quickly, and her team blamed Clinton for being stubbornly unwilling to take the advice of campaign chairman John Podesta and others to apologize, turn over her server, and move on. The entire experience made her a deeply vulnerable frontrunner out of the gate, and underscored a lack of trust between Clinton and her operatives, many of whom were former Obama staffers that she didn't consider part of her inner circle of trust.\n\nAs with many situations with the Clintons, the drama level is high. It\u2019s a soap opera. And from these reports, a loose confederacy of top dogs botching the messaging, which probably explains why she\u2019s gone down in the polls\u2013along with why she\u2019ll have trouble getting out. Last August, the Des Moines Register noted that her support had dropped by a third\u2013and that the old Obama coalition seemed to be drifting to Sanders. A disorganized staff, coupled with a candidate who is already a bad campaigner, is a recipe for lackluster results, which is what we\u2019re seeing.\n\nYet, this staff shakeup also seems to show signs that Clinton is thinking of her firewall in the South, where the electorate is more diverse and favorable to her. By the numbers, she should be able to trounce Sanders onward from South Carolina primary, but this double-digit blowout might have her preparing a shake up just in case some more cracks in her firewall appear in the days to come. Regardless, while some might note how Trump has caused chaos in the GOP primary, Democrats have a fragile frontrunner and a disheveled democratic socialist with horrible ideas vying to be the left\u2019s standard-bearer this year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Uh oh. .05/27/2016 8:49:50AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Uh oh.", "title": "Seeing Red: Clinton Considers Axing Staff In New Hampshire", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/02/08/feeling-the-bern-hillary-mulling-changes-to-new-hampshire-staff-n2116538", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/38/c437f6bd-b4ed-43db-8743-48ffeb181fa3.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Uh oh.", "title": "Seeing Red: Clinton Considers Axing Staff In New Hampshire", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/02/08/feeling-the-bern-hillary-mulling-changes-to-new-hampshire-staff-n2116538", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/38/c437f6bd-b4ed-43db-8743-48ffeb181fa3.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Seeing Red: Clinton Considers Axing Staff In New Hampshire, Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Politico published a piece today, which used mostly unnamed sources, that indicated the Clinton staff is equally frustrated, especially with how the former first lady dragged her feet on the email controversy.\nOver the summer while her campaign was bogged down in the email controversy, Clinton was deeply frustrated with her own staff, and vice versa.\nA disorganized staff, coupled with a candidate who is already a bad campaigner, is a recipe for lackluster results, which is what we\u2019re seeing.\nYet, Clinton could just add more staffers to make the ones she has a problem with irrelevant, but let's not kid ourselves about her potentially axing a few folks.\nYet, this staff shakeup also seems to show signs that Clinton is thinking of her firewall in the South, where the electorate is more diverse and favorable to her."}
