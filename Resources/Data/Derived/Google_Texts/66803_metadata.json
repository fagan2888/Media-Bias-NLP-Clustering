Her team quickly sent out a press release noting that she has $4.4 million in cash on hand, which the release said was \u201cmore than any Democrat in a competitive U.S. Senate race.\u201d So she probably has enough to see her through to the end, but obviously, the DSCC move isn\u2019t exactly a vote of confidence.\n\nEven so, I\u2019d like to pay her a compliment: I can\u2019t conceive of how she managed to sit there next to Mitch McConnell at that debate Monday night and hear him say some of the things he said without her head exploding. That took admirable self-control.\n\nI\u2019m not sure which suffix to add to \u201cshame\u201d to better describe McConnell\u2019s performance: Was it \u2013less, or was it \u2013ful? Remember Mitt Romney during the first debate of 2012, how he routinely said \u201cmy position is X\u201d (invariably a more centrist posture) when for the preceding umpteen months his position had been the much more right-wing Not X? Well, McConnell made Romney look like an ironman of forthright constancy. So this is how, with a 30-year Senate record that you\u2019d think you might be able to boast about, you win reelection: By completely misrepresenting who you\u2019ve been for the last six years, and by saying \u201cObama\u201d every 45 seconds.\n\nMisrepresentations were numerous, but let\u2019s just zero in on student loans. Grimes raised the issue and noted the rising costs of the loans, which Congress hasn\u2019t addressed. McConnell responded that the Senate had taken care of the issue in a bipartisan fashion. But it didn\u2019t. The Elizabeth Warren-sponsored bill failed in the Senate by four votes, getting only 56 yeas but needing 60 to end debate and make it to the floor. Two Republicans voted with the Democrats, but McConnell wasn\u2019t one of them. And McConnell said publicly at the time that he was against Warren\u2019s plan because it was \u201cdesigned to fail\u201d since it would raise taxes on rich people.\n\nMcConnell similarly talked out of both sides of his mouth on the minimum wage, the Earned Income Tax Credit, and other issues. And he, too, dodged a question, and it was one that\u2019s rather more important than the one Grimes dodged about whether she had voted for President Obama. McConnell wouldn\u2019t say whether climate change is real and whether humans contribute to it, so if he wins, Kentuckians will have the pleasure of knowing who their senator voted for in 2012 while he spends the next six years positioning himself to the right of Exxon-Mobil (which at least supports a carbon tax) and blocking any attempt to do anything about global warming.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s real howler, of course, had to do with Obamacare. As you may know by now, he said yes, sure, keep Kynect, the state\u2019s roaringly successful health-insurance exchange set up under the health-care law. After all, it\u2019s \u201cjust a website.\u201d\n\nThis was the moment when I was wondering how Grimes\u2019s head could possibly stay in one piece. As McConnell well knows, Kynect is not just a website. It\u2019s a state health-care program that citizens happen to be able to access through a website. Kentuckians go on to the Kynect website to see what types of insurance coverage are available to them under the Kynect program, which exists solely because of Obamacare. So if you repeal Obamacare \u201croot and branch,\u201d which is still McConnell\u2019s position, you can leave the Kynect website up, but those coverage options people find via the site will no longer exist. Saying keep the website but kill the program is like saying that someone can keep that nice-looking home page that says \u201cGoogle,\u201d but it just won\u2019t perform searches anymore.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing, the audacity of it. If what Grimes did on the Obama-vote question is \u201cdisqualifying,\u201d as Chuck Todd put it, then what is an incumbent senator telling a whopper like this? Given that half a million Kentuckians have signed up for insurance through Kynect, isn\u2019t this just a little more important? What\u2019s worse is that he knows he can get away with saying something like that because he is well aware that the explanation of why he\u2019s lying is a little complicated for the average voter to take in. The media just aren\u2019t set up to correct the record very well on things like this. I read a handful of write-ups of the debate from within Kentucky yesterday, and none among the few I read actually burrowed into an explanation of McConnell\u2019s lie. It just gets summarized as a \u201ctesty exchange\u201d or some such.\n\nThere was one event during this campaign season when McConnell did tell his audience the truth. But that didn\u2019t happen in Kentucky in front of voters. It happened over the summer in California, at the St. Regis Monarch Bay Resort, where rooms run upwards of $500 a night, at a gathering put together by the Koch brothers. McConnell has been saying on the trail that if he wins and the GOP takes the Senate, he\u2019ll open up the amendment process, implying that he\u2019d permit votes on issues Democrats wanted to push\u2014notably, of course, raising the minimum wage.\n\nBut behind closed doors at the Koch event, McConnell said the opposite, promising the 1 percenters that, should they win, his Republicans are \u201cnot going to be debating all these gosh darn proposals. That\u2019s all we do in the Senate is vote on things like raising the minimum wage [inaudible]\u2014cost the country 500,000 new jobs; extending unemployment\u2014that\u2019s a great message for retirees; uh, the student-loan package the other day, that\u2019s just going to make things worse, uh.\u201d\n\nThat was\u2014speaking of comparisons to Mitt Romney\u2014McConnell\u2019s 47 percent moment. The sentiment is not as clearly put, so it wasn\u2019t as usable for the opposition. But that was the probable (let\u2019s face it) future majority leader saying to his real base: Don\u2019t worry, boys, I got you covered.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "mtomasky"}, "keywords": "Google, Mitch McConnell, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201410150945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/voxbox/michael-tomasky", "description": "The Kentucky Republican who will likely be our next Senate majority leader has an astounding ability to lie, dissemble, and misrepresent himself to voters.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "The Amazingly Two-Faced Mitch McConnell", "tags": "syndication:syndication-google,entity:person/mitch_mcconnell,topic:politics", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"The Amazingly Two-Faced Mitch McConnell\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/15/the-amazingly-two-faced-mitch-mcconnell.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/10/15/the-amazingly-two-faced-mitch-mcconnell/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47112496.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/10/15/the-amazingly-two-faced-mitch-mcconnell\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-10-15T09:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Michael Tomasky\",\"tags\":[\"syndication-google\",\"mitch_mcconnell\",\"politics\"]}", "news_keywords": "Google, Mitch McConnell, US Politics", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics.michael-tomasky", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Michael Tomasky", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2014-10-15T09:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/michael-tomaskyhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/10/15/the-amazingly-two-faced-mitch-mcconnell", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "The Kentucky Republican who will likely be our next Senate majority leader has an astounding ability to lie, dissemble, and misrepresent himself to voters.", "title": "The Amazingly Two-Faced Mitch McConnell", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/15/the-amazingly-two-faced-mitch-mcconnell.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/10/15/the-amazingly-two-faced-mitch-mcconnell/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1413374898116.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/m/michael-tomasky", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "Kentuckians go on to the Kynect website to see what types of insurance coverage are available to them under the Kynect program, which exists solely because of Obamacare.\nMcConnell responded that the Senate had taken care of the issue in a bipartisan fashion.\nMcConnell similarly talked out of both sides of his mouth on the minimum wage, the Earned Income Tax Credit, and other issues.\nSo if you repeal Obamacare \u201croot and branch,\u201d which is still McConnell\u2019s position, you can leave the Kynect website up, but those coverage options people find via the site will no longer exist.\nAs McConnell well knows, Kynect is not just a website."}
