Now in its fourteenth year, this year\u2019s Dream Ride was the biggest yet, with riders and visiting Special Olympics athletes from as far away as Canada and Australia, all to benefit Special Olympics Connecticut.\n\n\u201cIt's an experience that's hard to put into words,\u201d said Mike Bozzuto of Bozzuto\u2019s, Inc., the presenting sponsor of Dream Ride. \u201cIt's the athletes, it's their families, it's the connection that happens with the crowd, there's an energy here that's unbelievable. You have to see it to believe it.\u201d\n\nThe weekend festivities stepped off Friday night, and kicked into high gear on Saturday with a car cruise and a special concert by the rising country act Lonestar. By Sunday, ten thousand motorcycle riders from twelve different states all converged in Farmington for the main event, a police escorted ride through the Farmington Valley.\n\nThe mission of Special Olympics is a personal cause for many participants, like Larry Jedrey, a police officer from Everett, Massachusetts with sixteen years on the force. For the veteran officer who\u2019s seen his share of tough stuff in the world, Dream Ride represents hope and inspiration \u2013 like the kind he discovered when he met 56-year-old Special Olympics Massachusetts athlete Bobby McNeil last year.\n\n\u201cI met Bobby, and he just got into my soul,\u201d said Jedrey. \u201cSo I wanted to dedicate my ride this year to Bobby.\u201d\n\nJedrey joined the Dream Ride Rally and rode his Victory motorcycle from West Palm Beach to Connecticut \u2013 a trip that took seven days \u2013 carrying a special medal the whole way. When he arrived in Connecticut on Friday, a surprise was waiting.\n\n\u201cI was exhausted, I got off my bike, and someone said \u2018Larry, look who\u2019s here,\u2019 and it was Bobby,\u201d Jedrey recalled, his eyes filling with tears. \u201cI got to give him his medal\u2026it\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nAccording to Bozzuto, it\u2019s just one of countless stories of inspiration that come out of Dream Ride every year.\n\n\u201cYou come here and you see an athlete smile and it's worth it all, what you're doing,\u201d said Bozzuto. \u201cA lot of people tell me this is one event where no matter how much you give, you get more from it.\u201d\n\nDream Ride wraps up Sunday night.
