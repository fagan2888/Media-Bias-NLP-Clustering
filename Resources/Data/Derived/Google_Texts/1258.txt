Obamacare might be turning into a liberal’s worst nightmare. Florida, once a hotbed for signups on the health insurance exchange, is letting the president down.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services boasted that 983,775 Floridians had enrolled as of May, but that number has since taken a nosedive. Insurance companies now say only 762,723 are enrolled – representing a 25 percent drop from original figures, according to the South Florida Business Journal.

The Office of Insurance Regulation’s spokesman, Harvey Bennett, attributed the decline to multiple factors, including canceled plans, missed premium payments and duplicate enrollees, the Business Journal reported.

Not surprisingly, the Obama administration hasn’t released full enrollment numbers since May. Republican leaders, meanwhile, are demanding answers.

U.S. Sens. John Barrasso of Wyoming and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee have asked the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to provide updated enrollment numbers, according to The Blaze.

“Since the last enrollment report issued by CMS, numerous investigations raise questions about the accuracy of the enrollment figures trumpeted by the administration in May,” Barrasso and Alexander wrote in a letter to the administrator of Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
