House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, Maryland Democrat, said Tuesday that the administration is working hard to fix issues associated with the HealthCare.gov website and that the “brand” of President Obama’s health care overhaul is intact.

But he wishes now he never called it “Obamacare.”

“The Affordable Care Act is the Affordable Care Act,” Mr. Hoyer told reporters. “The substance of the Affordable Care Act is positive for Americans, it’s positive for health care costs for all Americans … so I don’t know that we need to re-brand the Affordable Care Act.

“We do need to say that it’s the Affordable Care Act, and I think most Americans who didn’t have insurance are going to find that to be the case,” he continued. “I wish I hadn’t called it Obamacare before, because that has politicized it and has been used by the Republicans as a pejorative term.”

He acknowledged that the president himself has embraced the term.

“You know what Obama says, though, which I think is correct?” he added. “He says it’s going to be called by the Republicans — Obamacare — right up until the time it works.”
