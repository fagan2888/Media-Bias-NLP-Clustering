Don\u2019t worry, though, it wasn\u2019t real blood \u2014 just an attempt by Kanye West to extract some from the crowd by playing his current favorite song by himself over and over.\n\n\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t make much sense now, it should by the time we draw you further into this dalliance of a day, which also saw uplifting dance beats by Disclosure, Chromeo and Holy Ghost!, explorations of country and beyond from Kacey Musgraves, and so much more:\n\n\n\n1:20 PM: Festival early birds are greeted by the sounds of Greensky Bluegrass upon entering. Frisbees are hanging in the air and the sun is starting to peek through the cool summer fog.\n\n\n\n1:33 PM: Looking for two musical men named Art and John proves fruitless as it\u2019s the comedy duo of Garfunkel and Oates, stars of a new series on IFC, who are on the Outside Lands lineup today. Riki Lindhome and Kate Micucciere are here to start and close out a day of offbeat humor on The Barbary, a stage curated by standup comedy event SF Sketchfest.\n\n\n\n2:05 PM: Inside the tiny dance dome (or what its corporate sponsor would like to be known as The House by Heineken), SF\u2019s DJ Dials shouts, \u201cRaise your hand if you called off from work today!\u201d As everybody screams, he throws on a snippet of \u201cEverybody,\u201d a 2003 dance hit by Danish act Junior Senior.\n\n\n\n2:40 PM: Killer Mike and El-P (aka Run The Jewels) give love to the Bay Area community during their set on the main Lands End stage by dedicating \u201cDDFH\u201d (which stands for \u201cDo Dope Fuck Hope\u201d) to Oscar Grant, who was fatally shot by a transit policeman in Oakland in 2009. Killer Mike takes a moment to remember late local rapper Mac Dre and declares that Too $hort is his father figure. El-P calls out world champion turntablist DJ QBert to provide extra flair over \u201cNo Come Down.\u201d\n\n\n\n3:05 PM: After opening up the small Panhandle stage a few hours earlier, Night Terrors of 1927 is enjoying an intimate bonus set inside Soundwave, a Toyota-sponsored tent that serves as a makeshift car showroom. Frontman Blake Sennett looks out into the crowd and starts addressing a woman in a squirrel mask, deciphering her sign: \u201c\u2018I like big nuts and I cannot lie,\u2019\u201d he reads. \u201cI bet that works on every stage!\u201d \u201cWell, my work here is done,\u201d says the satisfied squirrel, scampering off.\n\n\n\n3:32 PM: No Native American-style headdresses are spotted during the subtle set of Apache/Puerto Rican/Filipino musician Nahko and Medicine for the People, which means people have hopefully gotten the memo as to the item\u2019s cultural insensitivity.\n\n\n\n3:50 PM: Warpaint is weaving a web of psychedelic awesomeness worthy of manifesting invisible fractals in the sky without pharmacological assistance. Yeah, they\u2019re that trippy in their simplicity.\n\n\n\n4:20 PM: With more than 200 edible items available throughout the park, this is just as much a food festival as a music one. Selections tend to be adventurous, including doughnut cheeseburgers and mushroom doughnuts. But the perfect item to fuel the day turns out to be a \u201chighbrow spaghetti Sloppy Joe\u201d sandwich made by AQ, a high end restaurant that normally serves a fine tasting menu.\n\n\n\n4:33 PM: It feels like an infomercial for Roland and Yamaha synthesizers over at Lands End, thanks to the retro noodlings of Holy Ghost!\n\n\n\n5:09 PM: Next up on the Lands End stage, Chromeo continue the synthpop takeover with enough cheeky bombast to make Jon Bon Jovi, well, \u201cJealous.\u201d Synthpop artists are more rock stars than rock stars these days.\n\nranger dave got jealous of @chromeo's fly jacket backstage but he's too cool to admit it #outsidelands pic.twitter.com/dBxYXADiGU \u2014 ranger dave (@sfoutsidelands) August 9, 2014\n\n\n\n5:22 PM: Back in the dance dome, Paul Johnson, a legendary Chicago DJ who is confined to a wheelchair, injects the festival with a necessary dose of old-school jackin house music. Today this style is apparently popular with stocky men in lucha libre Mexican wrestler masks.\n\n\n\n5:55 PM: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about a thing, \u2018cause every little thing gonna be alright!\u201d Bob Marley\u2019s oft-covered \u201cThree Little Birds\u201d sounds ebullient and fresh coming from country star \u201cSpacey\u201d Kacey Musgraves.\n\nsay what you think, love who you love cause you just get so many trips round the sun #ol2014 @KaceyMusgraves pic.twitter.com/kJaaNdDFUC \u2014 Lori Berenberg (@loriberenberg) August 9, 2014\n\n\n\n6:20 PM: A friend says the three-day ticket he bought from a secondhand source turned out to be a fake, but a little, um, gratuity given to someone at the entrance was enough to get him in anyway. The mockup of the Ticketmaster-branded pass looks remarkably convincing on the surface, but the bar code scanners don\u2019t lie.\n\n\n\n6:35 PM: Disclosure starts their deliciously bottom-heavy set with the remix of \u201cF for You\u201d featuring Mary J Blige, but unlike at last weekend\u2019s HARD Summer festival in Southern California, she does not appear in person to sing it. There\u2019s no more drama, though; brothers Guy and Howard Lawrence, clad in button-up shirts, make easy friends with the crowd when they thank them for being what they think is the biggest audience they\u2019ve played for in a short but meteoric career.\n\n\n\n7:37 PM: Space Disco, another Toyota-branded tent housing display cars, is blaring Tears For Fears\u2019 1985 hit \u201cEverybody Wants to Rule The World.\u201d\n\n\n\n7:39 PM: The unusual sound of the triangle beckons from the Panhandle stage, where Bear Hands are playing. It sounds like a full-on performance, but turns out it\u2019s not. \u201cIt\u2019s really weird to do a soundcheck in front of everyone,\u201d says singer Dillon Rau. \u201cSo, here\u2019s a preview of a song we\u2019re going to play for you in two minutes!\u201d\n\n\n\n7:42 PM: Giant red hearts are filling up the screens on the Twin Peaks stage, where Tegan & Saraare making it throb for the masses. The sisters have a killer live set closer that makes people skip with happiness, and it happens to be called \u201cCloser.\u201d\n\nOh hey @teganandsara, always a pleasure. Get your #EEEEEATS on girls.

If you\u2019re a friend of mine, you\u2019re really just a friend of yourself!\u201d\n\n\n\n9:20 PM: Snippets early hits come fast and furious, a blur that \"All Falls Down\" under \"All of The Lights.\"\n\n\n\n9:50 PM:\u201cBlood On The Leaves\u201d is back again to close the show, along with renewed orders to make more mosh pit circles. Kanye adores when the beat drops on this track so much that he pulls it back to release it for the third and final time, leaving the stage in foggy silence. He\u2019ll be a tough act to follow tomorrow, but plenty of artists are ready to go for it.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Billboard", "description": "Check out the highlights from the first day of the San Francisco festival.", "title": "Outside Lands 2014 Friday Highlights: Kanye West, Disclosure, Kacey Musgraves and More", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/6214264/outside-lands-2014-friday-kanye-west-tegan-sara-kacey-musgraves-disclosure", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/kanye-west-outside-lands-billboard-650-430.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 430}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Check out the highlights from the first day of the San Francisco festival.", "title": "Outside Lands 2014 Friday Highlights: Kanye West, Disclosure, Kacey Musgraves and More", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/6214264/outside-lands-2014-friday-kanye-west-tegan-sara-kacey-musgraves-disclosure", "image": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/kanye-west-outside-lands-billboard-650-430.jpg", "site": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Check out the highlights from the first day of the San Francisco festival.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Outside Lands 2014 Friday Highlights | Billboard"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce340\"", "article_summary": "4:33 PM: It feels like an infomercial for Roland and Yamaha synthesizers over at Lands End, thanks to the retro noodlings of Holy Ghost!\nChicken & waffles @LittleSkillet @outside_lands pic.twitter.com/NBOHYZoiUk \u2014 The Infatuation (@infatuation) August 9, 20148:12 PM: Hours after filling up the Polo Fields at the main Lands End stage with some mind-melding synthpop, Holy Ghost!\n5:09 PM: Next up on the Lands End stage, Chromeo continue the synthpop takeover with enough cheeky bombast to make Jon Bon Jovi, well, \u201cJealous.\u201d Synthpop artists are more rock stars than rock stars these days.\n1:33 PM: Looking for two musical men named Art and John proves fruitless as it\u2019s the comedy duo of Garfunkel and Oates, stars of a new series on IFC, who are on the Outside Lands lineup today.\nKiller Mike takes a moment to remember late local rapper Mac Dre and declares that Too $hort is his father figure."}
