But what\u2019s not as well known is the backstage role that the Catholic Church played in its creation.\n\nIn fact, without the church, there might not be a Hyde Amendment.\n\nHenry Hyde was a first-term congressman from Illinois when he introduced the amendment in June of 1976. The fledgling anti-abortion movement had been trying desperately since Roe v. Wade three years earlier to get Congress to pass a \u201cHuman Life Amendment\u201d to ban abortion, but wasn\u2019t getting anywhere.\n\nThe amendment took everyone by surprise, and represented a whole new tactic. Instead of banning abortion outright, opponents would seek to chip away at access by any means available. As Hyde himself famously said:\n\n\u201cI certainly would like to prevent, if I could legally, anybody having an abortion, a rich woman, a middle-class woman, or a poor woman. Unfortunately, the only vehicle available is the \u2026 Medicaid bill.\u201d\n\nThe bill passed the House but ran into opposition in the Senate. But with elections looming and abortion already a contentious issue in the presidential race, neither chamber of Congress wanted a drawn-out fight. So the Senate acquiesced\u2014with an exception if a women\u2019s life was in danger\u2014because it expected the Supreme Court to strike down the Medicaid funding restriction in two pending state cases.\n\nBut when the Supreme Court upheld the restrictions and Hyde reintroduced the amendment in 1977, an epic six-month battle broke out that paralyzed Congress. The Senate dug in and sought to lessen the impact of the ban by allowing \u201cmedically necessary\u201d abortions, as well as abortions for rape and incest. Leading the charge for the most restrictive form of the amendment \u2014 with no exemptions whatsoever \u2014 was Mark Gallagher, the lobbyist for the National Committee for a Human Life Amendment.\n\nThe NCHLA was created in 1974 by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops after it lost control of the National Right to Life Committee, which it also created, to a group of Catholic and Protestant anti-abortion leaders who were concerned that the bishops\u2019 involvement hampered anti-abortion efforts. The National Right to Life Committee had attracted millions of members since Roe, but it didn\u2019t have any lobbying clout on the Hill. The NCHLA was the only national anti-abortion organization that \u201cpossessed demonstrable political power and expertise,\u201d said Frederick Jaffe, Barbara Lindheim and Philip Lee in their book \u201cAbortion Politics.\u201d\n\nGallagher and Hyde worked hand-in-glove during the negotiations. The New York Times reported that Gallagher \u201c[made] his unofficial home on Capitol Hill in the office of Representative Henry Hyde\u201d from June to December 1977, when there were 25 roll-call votes on the Hyde Amendment. \u201cInnumerable sessions were held by conferees representing the two houses, and endless hours were consumed with arguments over the relative merits of terms like \u2018serious\u2019 versus \u2018severe\u2019 \u2026 and \u2018forced rape\u2019 versus \u2018rape\u2019,\u201d notes \u201cAbortion Politics.\u201d\n\nAll eyes were on Gallagher. \u201cEvery time the Senate conferees make a compromise offer, Mr. Gallagher quietly walks to the conference table to tell a staff aid to the 11 House conferees whether the proposal is acceptable to the bishops. His recommendations invariably are followed,\u201d the New York Times reported, noting that eight of the 11 House conferees were Catholic.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The 40-year battle over an anti-abortion strategy that the Church engineered continues to fuel gridlock even today", "title": "How the Catholic Church broke Congress", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The 40-year battle over an anti-abortion strategy that the Church engineered continues to fuel gridlock even today", "title": "How the Catholic Church broke Congress", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/29/how_the_catholic_church_broke_congress/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/mcconnell_pope_paul_vi.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The 40-year battle over an anti-abortion strategy that the Church engineered continues to fuel gridlock even today", "title": "How the Catholic Church broke Congress", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/mcconnell_pope_paul_vi.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Patricia Miller", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Abortion, Catholic Church, Catholicism, Congress, hyde amendment, Religion, Senate", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc81a\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Abortion, Catholic Church, Catholicism, Congress, hyde amendment, Religion, Senate, News, Politics NewsThe Hyde Amendment is back.\nIn fact, without the church, there might not be a Hyde Amendment.\nBut what\u2019s not as well known is the backstage role that the Catholic Church played in its creation.\nHis recommendations invariably are followed,\u201d the New York Times reported, noting that eight of the 11 House conferees were Catholic.\nBut when the Supreme Court upheld the restrictions and Hyde reintroduced the amendment in 1977, an epic six-month battle broke out that paralyzed Congress."}
