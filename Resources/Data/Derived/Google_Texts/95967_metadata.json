This Affordable Care Act program is particularly important to our community of readers who have disabilities, but who may not have previously qualified for insurance.\n\nThe Editorial Board of Living with a Disability magazine is urging all eligible and uninsured people with a disability who haven\u2019t already signed-up for a health plan via the Federal Government\u2019s health marketplace HealthCare.gov, to ensure that they do so by February 15, 2015 in order to avoid missing the 2015 enrollment deadline.\n\n\u201cThis Affordable Care Act program is particularly important to our community of readers who have disabilities, but who may not have previously qualified for insurance,\u201d commented Living with a Disability magazine\u2019s associate publisher Joshua C. Eyestone. \u201cNow there is a possibility that they will get the coverage the need and are entitled to, so they can live their life to its fullest.\u201d\n\nWhile the roll-out of HealthCare.gov was beset with high-profile technological problems, those problems appear to be resolved.\n\n\"Our primary goal in all of this is to be as fair, efficient and flexible as possible,\" commented Kevin Counihan, the CEO HealthCare.gov, which between November 15 and December 12, 2014 helped 2.5 million people select a health plan. According to the Congressional Budget Office, it\u2019s expected that by the end of the year, 9 million people will enroll in a health plan through the website, or about 2.3 million more than at the current time.\n\nAdded Mr. Eyestone: \u201cWe know that what is commonly referred to as Obamacare has triggered a lot of political discussion and very heated debate. However, regardless of what side of the political spectrum people fall on, we cannot afford to lose sight of what really matters, which is ensuring that the vulnerable in our society are appropriately insured so that their illness or disability doesn\u2019t become debilitating. Taking care of our neighbours is an American value that ties us all together, and it\u2019s the spirit that we rely on to publish Living with a Disability Magazine.\u201d\n\nReaders who visit Living with a Disability Magazine\u2019s website will find a wide range of other helpful articles related to a variety of healthy living tips that are valuable to both disabled and able-bodied individuals.
