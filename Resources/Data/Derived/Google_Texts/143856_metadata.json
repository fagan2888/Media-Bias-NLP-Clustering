And so when the Congressional Black Caucus endorsed Hillary \u2014 well, they\u2019re part of the establishment. When Planned Parenthood \u2014 people who\u2019ve risked their lives endorsed Hillary \u2014 part of the establishment.\u201d\n\nThe former president\u2019s talk also brushed up against the populism and anger fueling Republican candidate Donald Trump\u2019s success, contrasting the experiences of everyday Americans against the glowing report on the economy given by President Obama in his last State of the Union address.\n\n\u201cWhy is everybody so torn up in this election?\u201d Clinton asked. \u201cWhy do they have a food fight every time they have a Republican debate? Because too many people look at that beautiful picture that the president painted, and they cannot find themselves and their families in that picture to save their lives. That is the space in which this election is taking place.\u201d\n\nGreensboro Mayor Nancy Vaughan, who introduced Bill Clinton, joined the former president in leveling criticism at Bernie Sanders.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to vote for her based on her gender; I\u2019m asking you to vote for her based on her experience and for what she has done for our country for the last 40 years,\u201d Vaughan said. \u201cHaven\u2019t we waited long enough for affordable childcare and paid family leave? Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s finally time for equal pay for equal work?\n\n\u201cAs a woman I know we have to protect Obamacare, which stopped insurance companies from treating women with preexisting conditions,\u201d she continued. \u201cNow, who, in 1993, was the first person who took a real hard look at healthcare in our country? She set the mold in 1993. Senator Sanders wants to end Obamacare as we know it, and start from scratch. If we have an all-or-nothing approach, we\u2019re gonna end up with nothing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "During a campaign stop at Elon Law School in downtown Greensboro today, President Bill Clinton made the case that his wife, Hillary Clinton is the true change", "wot-verification": "d7ae3c718975faf566dc", "author": "Jordan Green", "og": {"site_name": "Triad City Beat", "description": "During a campaign stop at Elon Law School in downtown Greensboro today, President Bill Clinton made the case that his wife, Hillary Clinton is the true change agent, defending her against op\u2026", "title": "Bill Clinton stumps for Hillary in Greensboro", "url": "https://triad-city-beat.com/bill-clinton-stumps-for-hillary-in-greensboro/", "image": "http://triad-city-beat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_2498-300x300.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Triad_City_Beat", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "msvalidate.01": "C3C7632A4C6076CB2F0E8A1795E1F1BA", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://i1.wp.com/triad-city-beat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/cropped-bolt_512x512_BLK.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-07T20:18:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-07T20:44:34+00:00"}, "keywords": "bill clinton,elon law school,hillary clinton,nancy vaughan,news", "google-site-verification": "ipIGUsztUDNZupAHRYqXwnVBhaexnGV6OsyGDWgONlU", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd619d\"", "article_summary": "During a campaign stop at Elon Law School in downtown Greensboro today, President Bill Clinton made the case that his wife, Hillary Clinton is the true change agent, defending her against opponent Bernie Sanders\u2019 theme of \u201cpolitical revolution.\u201d\u201cI want you to vote for her because she\u2019s the best single change-maker I\u2019ve ever dealt with,\u201d Clinton said.\nThat is the space in which this election is taking place.\u201dGreensboro Mayor Nancy Vaughan, who introduced Bill Clinton, joined the former president in leveling criticism at Bernie Sanders.\nAnd so when the Congressional Black Caucus endorsed Hillary \u2014 well, they\u2019re part of the establishment.\nSenator Sanders wants to end Obamacare as we know it, and start from scratch.\n\u201cWhy is everybody so torn up in this election?\u201d Clinton asked."}
