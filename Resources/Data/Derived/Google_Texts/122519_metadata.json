Bannon on Wednesday\u2019s edition of the show on SiriusXM.\n\nTantaros noted that her book is not an \u201cI hate you feminist\u201d book. She gave great credit to the early feminists that \u201cpushed for equal rights\u201d that allow her to do the work she is doing today.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cThe problem is we don\u2019t talk about the downside in an honest way,\u201d said Tantaros, explaining, \u201cConservatives don\u2019t show up to the culture wars like Breitbart does. And Andrew Breitbart, he knew this instinctively. The culture is [where] the battle lines are drawn and the real wars are won. If you look at this election, this isn\u2019t going to be an election about Obamacare, it\u2019s not going to be an election about ISIS, it\u2019s going to be fought on the culture, in the culture.\u201d\n\nAs for the Democrat Party, Tantaros said, \u201cyour listeners know this better than anybody, it used to be the [party of the] working man, it used to be the party of unions, right? That is all gone. You see that voting bloc breaking with Trump and breaking with Sanders, especially last night. So where do Democrats go? They go to the social issues. They go to the culture.\u201d\n\nVoters in Nebraska and West Virginia\u2019s primary elections chose Donald Trump as their winning candidate in Tuesday\u2019s Republican primary elections. Trump won over 61.4 percent of the Republican primary vote in Nebraska and 77 percent in West Virginia. At the same time 51.4 percent of voters in West Virginia sided with Sanders as their Democratic Party winner over frontrunner Hillary Clinton who garnered a mere 35.8 percent.\n\nTantaros keyed in on the gender-laden culture wars being fought in the public arena.\n\n\u201cLast election, it was birth control and women\u2019s issues. Now it\u2019s bathrooms. Everything is about women and men \u2014 transgender, birth control, all the abortion. Everything is about women and men, and this is shaping up to be a battle of the sexes\u2026 Everything is taking place in the culture, which is where I squarely placed myself in this book because women and men, whether you\u2019re right or left, you\u2019re going to have natural biological wiring.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s gender roles, there\u2019s realities about men and women. We are equal, and I\u2019m glad that we have equal rights, but we\u2019re not the same and that was a big miscalculation of feminists.\u201d\n\nLater in the interview Tantaros noted that we can see this \u201cgender war\u201d taking shape in the 2016 presidential election between Trump and Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe men voters who have \u201cchecked out of society\u201d are also struggling economically. \u201cThese are the Trump voters,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are the Sanders voters that are eventually I think going to move over to Trump\u2019s side. So, you\u2019re seeing the effects of feminism playing out in a presidential election because the men are fighting back with a vote for Trump \u2014 finally a candidate that they feel actually speaks for them, speaks up for them.\u201d\n\nOn the other side, Tantaros said, \u201cYou have Hillary Clinton, whose campaign is frankly unraveling, hoping that she can play the woman card, rally women while Trump plays the man card and challenges her on her accusations that he\u2019s a misogynist with Bill Clinton as her husband. So, this is a war of the sexes that is shaping up.\u201d\n\nThe full title of Tantaros\u2019 book is Tied Up in Knots: How Getting What We Wanted Made Women Miserable.\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.\n\nListen to Tantaros\u2019 full interview below:\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana", "article_metadata": {"description": "Andrea Tantaros: 2016 Election \u2018Is Going to Be Fought on the Culture\u2019 Where \u2018Battle Lines Are Drawn and the Real Wars Are Won\u2019", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Andrea Tantaros: 2016 Election \u2018Is Going to Be Fought on the Culture\u2019 Where \u2018Battle Lines Are Drawn and the Real Wars Are Won\u2019", "title": "Andrea Tantaros: 2016 Election \u2018Is Going to Be Fought on the Culture\u2019 Where \u2018Battle Lines Are Drawn and the Real Wars Are Won\u2019 - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/Andrea-Tantaros-book-cover.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2016-05-11T14:57:10-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2016/05/11/andrea-tantaros-2016-election-fought-culture-battle-lines-drawn-real-wars-won/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Andrea Tantaros: 2016 Election \u2018Is Going to Be Fought on the Culture\u2019 Where \u2018Battle Lines Are Drawn and the Real Wars Are Won\u2019", "creator": "@michellediana", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/Andrea-Tantaros-book-cover.jpg", "title": "Andrea Tantaros: 2016 Election \u2018Is Going to Be Fought on the Culture\u2019 Where \u2018Battle Lines Are Drawn and the Real Wars Are Won\u2019 - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016, Andrea Tantaros, bathrooms, Birth Control, Breitbart News Daily, Culture, Culture War, Donald Trump, election, equal rights, feminism, gender roles, gender wars, Hillary Clinton, men, Transgender, women,2016 Presidential Race, Radio,Andrea Tantaros", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2016-05-11T14:56:17-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/michdimoo", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2016-05-11T14:57:10-07:00", "tag": "women", "categories": "2016 Presidential Race,Radio"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "The culture is [where] the battle lines are drawn and the real wars are won.\nThe men voters who have \u201cchecked out of society\u201d are also struggling economically.\n\u201cThese are the Trump voters,\u201d she said.\nSo, this is a war of the sexes that is shaping up.\u201dThe full title of Tantaros\u2019 book is Tied Up in Knots: How Getting What We Wanted Made Women Miserable.\nTantaros keyed in on the gender-laden culture wars being fought in the public arena."}
