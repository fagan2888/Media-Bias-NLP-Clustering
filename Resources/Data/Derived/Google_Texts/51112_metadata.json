Wow, oh wow. Of course I want to write about it instantly, but I can\u2019t because I ended last week\u2019s column with this bit of cleverness: \u201cCome back next week for more happy, hopeful signs that the Healthy Lifestyle Revolution is taking hold and changing our DNA.\u201d I promised. I\u2019m obligated. I feel I must keep my word but now I realize it\u2019s a mistake to end a column with a promise because it keeps me from being seduced by the moment. So epigenetics it is. I\u2019ll write about the Apple Watch next week.\n\n\u201cEpigenetics . . . is perhaps the most important discovery in the science of heredity since the gene,\u201d writes David Shenk, author of \u201cThe Genius in All of Us: Why Everything You\u2019ve Been Told About Genetics, Talent and IQ Is Wrong.\u201d\n\nEpigenetics is the next step, the new frontier, the science of changing the way your genes express themselves. Genes can express themselves as disease, or reversal of disease, and the big news is you have much more control over that than you think \u2014 if you ever think about your genes at all.\n\n\u201cBasically, epigenetics demonstrates how environment and behavior choices can influence our genetic code,\u201d says Dr. Theri Griego Raby, one of a growing number of doctors who see how epigenetics can play a huge role in disease prevention and well-being.\n\nContrary to what many of us learned in school, \u201cgenes are not fixed predetermined blueprints passed from generation to generation,\u201d Dr. Raby writes, based on the latest epigenetic research.\n\n\u201cInstead, our genome contains at least 4 million \u2018switches\u2019 that can be turned on and off by life experiences and environmental influences.\u201d Life experiences! Environmental influences! That\u2019s where you come in. Scientists now have evidence that lifestyle alone \u2014 your choice to smoke, to eat real food, to be physically active \u2014 can alter the epigenetic markers that sit above your DNA. The above ones have all the say, not just for your lifetime but affecting future generations.\n\nI\u2019m wildly oversimplifying, but think about this: Your healthy lifestyle today can predispose your kids and grandkids to greater wellness and a longer life, even before they are conceived! Of course, they then have to make the choices to influence their own genetic code.\n\nIt\u2019s fascinating stuff.\n\nSo let\u2019s delve a bit deeper.\n\n\u201cEpi\u201d is a prefix that means \u201cabove.\u201d Epigenetics looks above the double-helix 25,000-chromosome genetic code and sees another level of influence: the cellular material that sits on top of the genome and outside it.\n\nOn top and outside. Get a picture of it. Paint it a color you like.\n\nThat \u201con top\u201d and \u201coutside\u201d cellular material is called the epigenome. Scientists aren\u2019t prepared to say how many epigenome marks there are, but the number is well into the millions. Your genes are your genes, but these epigenetic marks tell your genes to switch on or switch off, to express themselves loudly or go mute.\n\nIf you can manage to mute your colon cancer gene, let\u2019s say, by exercising more and eating clean, real food that doesn\u2019t come in plastic, you\u2019re managing your epigenome in a healthy way.\n\nAs the biologists like to say, the genome is the hardware, and the epigenome is the software.\n\nAnd to a large extent, you are the epigenome software programmer in charge. It\u2019s not all fixed and predetermined. Your choices really do matter.\n\nSo what can you do to help your genes behave? Plenty.\n\n\u201cHow we sleep, the types and levels of stress we experience, the type of foods we eat, toxin exposure, alcohol, and lack of exercise can all alter our genetic makeup during gestation, early development, and throughout adulthood,\u201d Dr. Raby says.\n\n\u201cFor example, consuming foods rich in gene-altering methyl groups like non-genetically modified soybeans, red grapes, or green tea may protect against disease by deactivating detrimental gene \u2018switches.\u2019 \u201d Enough for today. I welcome you to research more on your own, but know this: Your DNA isn\u2019t your destiny. There is wiggle room, and the sooner you start to shake things up, the better.\n\nMarilynn Preston is a fitness expert, personal trainer and speaker on healthy lifestyle issues.
