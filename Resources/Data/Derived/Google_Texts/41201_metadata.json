Swearinger.\n\nSwearinger received a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty and on the next play, Manning threw a touchdown pass to Emmanuel Sanders. As most Broncos celebrated with Sanders, Manning \u2014 mindful of the two concussions Welker suffered late last season that forced him to miss the final three games \u2014 ran directly to Swearinger in the end zone and gave him the what-for.\n\n\u201cHe was mad about the hit I made on Welker,\u201d Swearinger said.\n\nWelker did not practice Monday and he probably will be out the rest of this week. There is hope within the team that he will pass all concussion tests and be cleared a couple of days before the Broncos\u2019 season opener Sept. 7 against Indianapolis.\n\nFor most of Welker\u2019s career, the numbers attached to his player bio had to do with catches. In the six-year span from 2007-12 with the New England Patriots, Welker averaged an astonishing 112 receptions.\n\nSince becoming a free agent and signing with the Broncos before last season, Welker has picked up a new number: three. As in three concussions dating to Nov. 17 of last year.\n\nHe also had 73 catches and 10 touchdowns in only 13 games last season.\n\nThe position he plays probably doesn\u2019t help. Slot receivers work the middle of the field, between the hashes.\n\n\u201cYou have to avoid linebackers, you have to avoid safeties, you have to sit down in the zone \u2014 and that\u2019s where the big hits can come from,\u201d said Sanders, who played slot with Pittsburgh but is an outside receiver with the Broncos. \u201cWhereas on the outside, they\u2019ll come, but they\u2019re not going to come as much as in the slot.\u201d\n\nIn Welker\u2019s favor, the NFL is taking head injuries far more seriously than it did five years ago.\n\n\u201cThere are independent doctors now that are in charge,\u201d Broncos coach John Fox said. \u201cThere\u2019s a protocol both on the sideline and in the locker room. After the diagnosis of a concussion, there is a protocol on the amount of exercise. The list goes on. There\u2019s no doubt: It\u2019s heightened now as opposed to 10 years ago.\u201d\n\nWelker walked into the locker room under his own power Saturday, and unlike the concussions he received last season, the Swearinger forearm was absorbed by a more padded, snug \u201cconcussion helmet.\u201d\n\nStill, Fox was careful not to describe Welker\u2019s concussion as \u201cmild.\u201d\n\nAsked about Welker\u2019s spirits Monday, Fox said: \u201cVery good. I talked to him this morning, he\u2019s feeling good. Again, he\u2019s going through the protocol now, and he\u2019ll be out there when he\u2019s deemed healthy.\u201d\n\nThere is no uniform timetable involved in the NFL concussion protocol. Each case is treated individually. Running back C.J. Anderson suffered a concussion in the Broncos\u2019 first preseason game and was back in a week. Welker sat out four weeks, counting a playoff bye, after his second concussion last season.\n\nThe concussion protocol begins with cognitive tests, and then cardio exercise is gradually worked in. Then the player is given light strength exercises. Then there\u2019s cardio mixed with strength exercises.\n\nUltimately, a doctor independent of the Broncos and the NFL decides whether a player is cleared from all concussion symptoms.\n\nMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikeklis", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Broncos are being careful with Wes Welker\u2019s concussion", "title": "Denver Broncos are being careful with Wes Welker\u2019s concussion", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/25/denver-broncos-are-being-careful-with-wes-welkers-concussion/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140825__20140826_B6_SP26FBNWELKERp1.jpg", "height": 428}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140825__20140826_B6_SP26FBNWELKERp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-25T21:18:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:33:34+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc851\"", "article_summary": "Again, he\u2019s going through the protocol now, and he\u2019ll be out there when he\u2019s deemed healthy.\u201dThere is no uniform timetable involved in the NFL concussion protocol.\nThe concussion protocol begins with cognitive tests, and then cardio exercise is gradually worked in.\nSince becoming a free agent and signing with the Broncos before last season, Welker has picked up a new number: three.\n\u201cHe was mad about the hit I made on Welker,\u201d Swearinger said.\nUltimately, a doctor independent of the Broncos and the NFL decides whether a player is cleared from all concussion symptoms."}
