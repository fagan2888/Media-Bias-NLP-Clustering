Tanner Jaillet made 51 saves in the DU net.\n\n\u201cThis is the most fun hockey players can do, playing in overtime in a playoff,\u201d said Staub, a freshman from Colorado Springs. \u201cSo we were just enjoying the moment, getting ready to go with each overtime.\u201d\n\nDU coach Jim Montgomery noted that under the current rules, the only time a game at Magness Arena can go to marathon overtime is the quarterfinal series of the league tournament. But the previous longest game in the building was DU\u2019s 3-2 victory over Providence on Oct. 16, 1999. Joe Ritson scored to end that at 4:25 of the second overtime.\n\nWhen Montgomery, a journeyman in the American Hockey League and NHL, was asked if he was involved in any marathon playoff games during his career, he brought up playing for the Philadelphia Phantoms of the American Hockey League against the Saint John Flames.\n\n\u201cOh, man, we went back to back in the Calder Cup Finals when we won in Philadelphia in \u201998,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Phantoms won Game 1 in double overtime 3-2, and dropped Game 2 in one overtime by the same score.\n\n\u201cI remember in Game 2, I had a tough time lifting my stick,\u201d Montgomery said.\n\nThe Phantoms won that series and the AHL title in six games.\n\nThe Pioneers, of course, will have a chance to win a league postseason championship trophy over the weekend in Minneapolis.\n\nLooking ahead to St. Cloud State, Staub said, \u201cThey embarrassed us the last time we played them. We have to keep that in the back of our minds. They\u2019re in our way, so we have to do what we can to get rid of them.\u201d\n\nSt. Cloud State beat the Pioneers 5-2 and 6-2 in Denver in mid-December at the low point of the young Pioneers\u2019 season. DU, seeded third in the league postseason, is now 22-8-5 and has an 11-game winning streak heading into the semifinal against the Huskies.\n\n\u201cI know what the game plan is already,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cYou have to stay out of the box and can\u2019t give them odd-man rushes. Besides that, the technical stuff, the X\u2019s and O\u2019s, this is going to be about who wins the one-on-one battles.\n\n\u201cThis time of year, your team is what you are and the same thing with them.\u201d\n\nA loss to second-seeded St. Cloud State or in the championship game to the winner of the No. 1 North Dakota vs. No. 4 Minnesota Duluth semifinal won\u2019t cost the Pioneers a berth in the 16-team NCAA Tournament. The selection show is Sunday and the four regional sites are Cincinnati and Worcester, Mass. (March 25-26); and Albany, N.Y., and St. Paul, Minn. (March 26-27).\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Frozen Faceoff next step for Denver Pioneers", "title": "Frozen Faceoff next step for Denver Pioneers", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/13/frozen-faceoff-next-step-for-denver-pioneers/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160313__Colin-Staub-Denver-Pioneersp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160313__Colin-Staub-Denver-Pioneersp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-13T17:22:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-14T22:03:50+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "NCAA hockey, University of Denver"}, "article_summary": "Cloud State beat the Pioneers 5-2 and 6-2 in Denver in mid-December at the low point of the young Pioneers\u2019 season.\nCloud State in a Friday semifinal at the league\u2019s Frozen Faceoff in Minneapolis.\nThe Phantoms won Game 1 in double overtime 3-2, and dropped Game 2 in one overtime by the same score.\nCloud State, Staub said, \u201cThey embarrassed us the last time we played them.\nCloud State or in the championship game to the winner of the No."}
