PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — In the wake of violent anti-government protests and a commission’s call for his resignation, Prime Minister Laurent Lamothe said Saturday that he would address the nation to make an announcement.

Lamothe’s statement, made via his Twitter account, did not indicate whether he would leave office, but it came just hours after President Michel Martelly said he accepted the findings of the commission, which he appointed to break Haiti’s political stalemate.

Government officials said late Saturday that Lamothe would be delivering his speech within minutes, but more than two hours passed with no announcement.

Haiti’s capital has endured a growing number of violent demonstrations in which protesters are demanding long-delayed elections and the resignations of Lamothe as well as Martelly.

On Saturday, one man died in a protest in Port-Au-Prince during clashes with police who were firing tear gas. It was not immediately clear how the man died, although he was shot at least once in the wrist. U.N. troops were not present at Saturday’s protest. The demonstrations also spread to other towns, including Gonaives and Cap-Haitien.

The unrest followed a demonstration Friday in which U.N. peacekeeping troops opened fire on a crowd that marched through Port-au-Prince, set tires on fire and skirmished with troops and police.
