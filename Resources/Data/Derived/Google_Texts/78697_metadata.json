But the family will lose that coverage when Heidi takes a leave of absence to campaign full-time. And this will put the Cruz family into a situation familiar to millions of Americans: figuring out what to do when you can no longer get coverage through work.\n\nNow, Cruz's situation is a little bit different \u2014 he's a member of Congress, so he will have a job even after his wife Heidi leaves hers. But under Obamacare, legislators can only get their coverage through the law's insurance marketplaces rather than the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, which covers other federal workers.\n\nThis means Cruz will likely spend some time shopping on Healthcare.gov. And because of the new window-shopping options the website added this year, we can actually see the plans the senator will choose from.
