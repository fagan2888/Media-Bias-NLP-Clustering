Frankly, I tend to think that all kids should be vaccinated against illnesses that I only know about because my 8-bit characters died from them on Oregon Trail, but there\u2019s more than meets the eye when it comes to the great \u201cvaccine debate\u201d we seem to be having in this country thanks to some people who decided to pack measles in their carry-ons when they visited DisneyLand.\n\nShould everyone be forced to vaccinate? I have no clue. Should Republican Presidential candidates stop talking about it? Absolutely. There is absolutely no good that can come out of this sudden, field-wide urge to prognosticate on benefits and concerns about vaccines, and meanwhile, everyone who has said anything from the GOP camp is playing nicely into the media\u2019s narrative that Republicans are somehow anti-science. Because, while leading Democrats and liberal-leaning media sources are patting themselves on the back for taking the \u201cscience-based approach\u201d to mandatory vaccine schedules, most of the people responsible for the re-emergence of Dark Ages thinking in regards to medicine live in quiet, upper-middle-class liberal enclaves, and exist on the fringes of progressive, not conservative bases.\n\nBecause here\u2019s the truth: This is largely a liberal fringe issue. The people not vaccinating their kids against the diseases once declared defeated don\u2019t live in South Carolina or Indiana or a particularly conservative part of Ohio or Florida. That isn\u2019t where people are contracting the whooping cough, like it\u2019s goddamn Little Women. No, the strongholds are in places like Newport Beach, Santa Monica, and Marin County, California. The affluent, the educated, the enlightened, the ones who believe in purity and science \u2014 people in liberal enclaves are the ones rejecting one of the 20th century\u2019s major scientific achievements. Half of the children that attend some schools in Marin (median income: $90,839), the county\u2019s health officer told the New York Times last week, are unvaccinated. People don\u2019t want toxins in their children\u2019s blood. \u201cIt\u2019s good to explore alternatives rather than go with the panic of everyone around you,\u201d the mother of two unvaccinated children told the Times. \u201cVaccines don\u2019t feel right for me and my family.\u201d\n\nBy speculating on \u201cparental choice\u201d (Christie) and how vaccines trigger \u201cprofound mental disorders\u201d (Rand Paul) or \u201chorrible autism\u201d (Donald Trump), potential GOP candidates aren\u2019t making themselves any more appealing to fringe GOPers, but instead, making themselves slightly more appealing to people who will ignore them, and slightly less appealing to normal individuals concerned for their kids\u2019 well being. The questions are coming, quite deliberately, from a media intent on showcasing scientific and medical ignorance, and every one of these men is simply playing into the media\u2019s hand. And while polling may put Republicans at slightly less likely than Democrats to support mandatory vaccine requirements, it seems the biggest concern isn\u2019t efficacy of the vaccines themselves, but suspicion of any government program that mandates anything, cutting into the freedoms associated with parental choice.\n\nThey\u2019re also obscuring the fact that liberals can and often do pander to hippies, because, to liberal and Democratic candidates, these audiences account for votes and money. Both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton made overtures to anti-vaccine contingents in 2008, the current President going on record as being supicious of the potential for vaccines to cause harm, and calling a link between the MMR and autism \u201cinconclusive\u201d despite great evidence to the contrary. Heck, this year\u2019s White House budget slashes a whopping $50 million from the Health and Human Services vaccine program for the underpriveledged, exposing those who can\u2019t afford regular medical care, even under the new Obamacare regime, to deadly and disfiguring diseases, while the United States is facing down a quickly-spreading measles outbreak that\u2019s infected more people in just a few short months than in all of the last decade.\n\nWhen it comes to a question about vaccines, guys, here\u2019s some free advice from a communications professional: just say they\u2019re good and walk away. Although, if you didn\u2019t already know to tactfully avoid needlessly provacative questioning from media, and as such, have been outmaneuvered by the likes of Dr. Ben Carson and Hillary Clinton, perhaps it\u2019s best you bow out of the contest now before things get too hairy.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.4"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0997\"", "article_summary": "Should Republican Presidential candidates stop talking about it?\nWhen it comes to a question about vaccines, guys, here\u2019s some free advice from a communications professional: just say they\u2019re good and walk away.\nThey\u2019re also obscuring the fact that liberals can and often do pander to hippies, because, to liberal and Democratic candidates, these audiences account for votes and money.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to explore alternatives rather than go with the panic of everyone around you,\u201d the mother of two unvaccinated children told the Times.\nNo, the strongholds are in places like Newport Beach, Santa Monica, and Marin County, California."}
