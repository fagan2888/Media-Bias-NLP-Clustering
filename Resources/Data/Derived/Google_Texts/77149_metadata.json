One player on CBS Chicago\u2019s Bracket Challenge also picked Mercer and is undefeated so far.\n\nNearly 97 percent of the ESPN players picked Duke in the first round.\n\nThe problem for the president is this: It is easy to recover from a few mistakes with first-round picks when points awarded are fewer. However, once players get farther into the tournament, they need their teams to stay alive when awarded points are higher.\n\nSo, one could expect the president\u2019s lofty rating to take a serious hit as the games continue.\n\nObama, who has picked a bracket every year as president, only correctly picked the national champion in 2009, North Carolina.\n\nLast year, Obama\u2019s bracket ranked in the 74th percentile.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President and bracketologist Barack Obama has gone a respectable 14-3 so far in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2014/03/21/march-madness-trouble-ahead-for-barack-obamas-bracket/", "image": {"width": 1500, "secure_url": "https://cbschicago.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/obama.jpg?w=1500", "identifier": "https://cbschicago.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/obama.jpg?w=1500", "height": 1000}, "type": "article", "description": "President and bracketologist Barack Obama has gone a respectable 14-3 so far in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.", "title": "March Madness: Trouble Ahead For Barack Obama's Bracket"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbschicago.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/obama.jpg?w=1500", "title": "March Madness: Trouble Ahead For Barack Obama's Bracket", "site": "CBSchicago", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "President and bracketologist Barack Obama has gone a respectable 14-3 so far in the first round of the NCAA Tournament."}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Chicago News, Sports, Weather, Traffic, and the Best of Chicago - CBS 2 TV | WBBM Newsradio 780 | 670 The Score", "keywords": "local, news, sports, syndicated local, barack obama, bracket challenge, ncaa march madness", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Chicago", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msvalidate.01": "0FD6BCBEF9479095CF623C15833E1E08", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/cbschicago", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/cbschicago"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/87568ef37c252bc5ea7c1d183167347b?s=16", "news_keywords": "barack obama, bracket challenge, ncaa march madness"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde1db\"", "article_summary": "One player on CBS Chicago\u2019s Bracket Challenge also picked Mercer and is undefeated so far.\nObama, who has picked a bracket every year as president, only correctly picked the national champion in 2009, North Carolina.\nNearly 97 percent of the ESPN players picked Duke in the first round.\nThat ranks him in the top 2 percent in the country right now in ESPN\u2019s Tournament Challenge, but there is trouble ahead for him.\nBy John DodgeCHICAGO (CBS) \u2014 President and bracketologist Barack Obama has gone a respectable 14-3 so far in the first round of the NCAA Tournament."}
