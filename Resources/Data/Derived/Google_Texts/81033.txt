Creationists are grumbling about Neil deGrasse Tyson’s “Cosmos: A Space-Time Odyssey.” The show doesn’t contain creationist theories about the universe’s origins. On Thursday, Danny Faulkner, of Answers in Genesis, took to “The Janet Mefferd Show” to make a plea for “balance.”

Faulkner complained, “I don’t recall seeing any interviews with people – that may yet come – but it’s based upon the narration from the host and then various types of little video clips of various things, cartoons and things like that.”

Mefferd suggested that “Cosmos” bring in a different “scientific” point of view. “Boy, but when you have so many scientists who simply do not accept Darwinian evolution, it seems to me that that might be something to throw in there,” she said. “You know, the old, ‘some scientists say this, others disagree and think this,’ but that’s not even allowed.”

That would be because creationism isn’t rooted in science. Whereas, especially after revelations of gravitational waves this week, if confirmed, there may be more evidence to support the Big Bang theory. Creationism is rooted in a religious text.
