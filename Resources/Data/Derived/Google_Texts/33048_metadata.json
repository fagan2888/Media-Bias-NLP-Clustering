Funding for the larger organizations \u2014 Tier I \u2014 would drop by $37.3 million.\n\nWhy this shift? The board recognizes there is a need to provide additional funding for the medium and small groups while at the same time preserving and maintaining the infrastructure and assets of our most iconic institutions \u2014 the Denver Art Museum, Denver Museum of Nature & Science, Denver Botanic Gardens, the Denver Center for the Performing Arts, and the Denver Zoo.\n\nThese organizations may be located in Denver, but they serve a vast regional audience. More than three-fourths of their attendance comes from the counties outside of Denver.\n\nThese institutions have tremendous overhead, charged with preserving art that is thousands of years old, our state\u2019s paleontology and rare botany, as well as caring for literally thousands of animals. The original intent of the SCFD legislation 27 years ago was to make sure these institutions would be able to serve our citizens for countless generations.\n\nOver the years, the funding levels have not remained static. Funding for the organizations in tiers II and III has increased in prior votes and, if approved, will increase again.\n\nThe radical change suggested by a small group arriving late to the party (after a four-year process) to change the funding formula to 50 percent for Tier I, 30 percent for Tier II and 20 percent for Tier III simply is not based on real needs \u2014 50/30/20 may make a great slogan, but it is not a plan.\n\nI believe the increases proposed by the SCFD board are prudent and responsible and, most importantly, will be seen as reasonable when scrutinized by voters.\n\nDan Hopkins is chair of the Scientific and Cultural Facilities District board.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Guest Commentary: In defense of SCFD board\u2019s funding plan", "title": "Guest Commentary: In defense of SCFD board\u2019s funding plan", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/04/guest-commentary-in-defense-of-scfd-boards-funding-plan/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150904__OP06HOPKINSp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150904__OP06HOPKINSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-04T12:54:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T18:29:57+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda54e\"", "article_summary": "I believe the increases proposed by the SCFD board are prudent and responsible and, most importantly, will be seen as reasonable when scrutinized by voters.\nThe changes supported by the board will increase funding for Tier II groups by $22 million and for Tier III groups by $15.3 million over the 12 years covered by the proposal.\nFunding for the larger organizations \u2014 Tier I \u2014 would drop by $37.3 million.\nFunding for the organizations in tiers II and III has increased in prior votes and, if approved, will increase again.\nThe increases in funding for the medium (Tier II) and small (Tier III) organizations in the Scientific and Cultural Facilities District as proposed by the SCFD Board are substantive, nowhere \u201cclose to what they are now,\u201d as claimed in your article."}
