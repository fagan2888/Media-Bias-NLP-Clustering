Johnson & Johnson ranked seventh overall in money held offshore with $50.9 billion held by 60 offshore subsidiaries. Abbott Laboratories was 21st with $24 billion divided among its 79 foreign subsidiaries. Medtronic ranked 27th with a reported $20.5 billion kept by 37 subsidiaries abroad. Other medical device companies mentioned in the report include:\n\nBaxter International, with $12.2 billion in 12 subsidiaries\n\nBoston Scientific, with $11.9 billion in 42 subsidiaries\n\n3M, with $9.7 billion in 12 subsidiaries\n\nStryker, with $7 billion in 38 foreign subsidiaries\n\nBecton Dickinson, with $4.4 billion in 38 subsidiaries\n\nSt. Jude Medical, with $3.6 billion in 10 subsidiaries\n\nAlthough the practice of booking offshore profits in tax havens has long been used by American corporations, the study said abusing current U.S. taxation laws could ultimately cost average American taxpayers more.\n\n\u201cCongress has left loopholes in our tax code that allow this tax avoidance, which forces ordinary Americans to make up the difference. Every dollar in taxes that corporations avoid by using tax havens must be balanced by higher taxes on individuals, cuts to public investments and public services, or increased federal debt,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nStill, medical device companies are unlikely to abandon the industry practice of using tax havens due to stiff competition and legislation such as the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and its medical device excise tax \u2014 that significantly affect their bottom lines. A recent report suggested that Medtronic is preparing to buy Smith & Nephew for tax inversion purposes by moving its legal and tax base from the U.S. to the United Kingdom.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"description": "<p>Many of the largest U.S. corporations, including leading medical device companies, reportedly exploit legal loopholes and use accounting tricks to keep profits in tax havens abroad and avoid paying U.S. taxes, a new report suggests.</p>", "creator": "Jof Enriquez", "image": {"src": "http://vertassets.blob.core.windows.net/image/72e283dc/72e283dc-a0e4-4231-a7e6-bed33663848e/istock_keyboard_money_stethoscope.jpg"}, "title": "Medical Device Companies Stash Billions In Tax Havens", "site": "meddeviceonline", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Many of the largest U.S. corporations, including leading medical device companies, reportedly exploit legal loopholes and use accounting tricks to...", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "Title": "Medical Device Companies Stash Billions In Tax Havens"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfda2\"", "article_summary": "Still, medical device companies are unlikely to abandon the industry practice of using tax havens due to stiff competition and legislation such as the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and its medical device excise tax \u2014 that significantly affect their bottom lines.\nMedical Device Companies Stash Billions In Tax HavensBy Jof EnriquezFollow me on Twitter @jofenriqMany of the largest U.S. corporations, including leading medical device companies, reportedly exploit legal loopholes and use accounting tricks to keep profits in tax havens abroad and avoid paying U.S. taxes, a new report suggests.\nSome of the biggest players in the medical device sector were also included in the report.\nJohnson & Johnson ranked seventh overall in money held offshore with $50.9 billion held by 60 offshore subsidiaries.\n\u201cBy booking profits to subsidiaries registered in tax havens, multinational corporations are able to avoid an estimated $90 billion in federal income taxes each year,\u201d the report stated."}
