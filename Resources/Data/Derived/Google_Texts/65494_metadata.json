Many maple trees have been tapped for 150 years or more. \u2022The maple season may last eight to 10 weeks, but the sap flow is heaviest for about 10 to 20 days in early spring. \u2022 A gallon of maple syrup weighs 11 pounds. In comparison, a gallon of milk weights about eight pounds. \u2022 Maple syrup is boiled even further to make maple candy and maple sugar. \u2022 It takes one gallon of maple syrup to produce eight pounds of maple candy or sugar. \u2022 The sugar content of maple sap is 2.5 percent. The sugar content of maple syrup is at least 66 percent or more.

Last year we started on Feb. 17. This year, it was a week later,\u201d said Friend.\n\nMilroy Farms produces maple syrup, candy, spread and cream from 10,000 taps generally yielding about 180,000 gallons of sap.\n\nFriend said the operation is behind on the boiling process, in which the sap is heated to reduce the water content, leaving behind the syrup. It takes about 40 to 50 gallons of sap \u2014 depending on the sugar content \u2014 to produce one gallon of syrup.\n\nBy this time most years, the sweet-smelling steam billowing from \u201csugar houses\u201d where the sap is boiled can be found throughout the county.\n\n\u201cWe're actually married to the weather reports,\u201d joked Bill Phillips, president of the Northwest Pennsylvania Maple Association.\n\n\u201cI think most people have tapped. We are waiting for the weather to turn so it runs,\u201d said Phillips, owner of Fort LeBoeuf Maple in Erie County.\n\nBut while sap-watchers are glued to weather reports these days, they're hoping it doesn't get too warm too quickly.\n\nAn early spring could be disastrous.\n\n\u201cThe season is over when the buds (on the trees) burst open. A few years ago, the season ended on March 12. It was too warm,\u201d Phillips said.\n\nScientists say the weather will not affect the quality of syrup produced this year. And once the season begins, there is no telling how much sap will be gathered.\n\n\u201cIt probably will shorten the season, but it will not necessarily be a poor season,\u201d said Jim Finley, professor of forest resources at Penn State. \u201cThe volume could be really good on the few days it flows.\u201d\n\nIt's a wait-and-see story playing out in most maple syrup-producing states where frigid temperatures have stalled the process.\n\nFrom Connecticut to Kentucky and Illinois to New York, maple producers are hoping a break in the weather will send sap flowing from their trees.\n\nIn New York state, producers near the eastern shore of Lake Ontario still have sap-gathering lines buried under five feet of snow, said Helen Thomas, executive director of the New York State Maple Producers Association. New York is the nation's second biggest producer of maple syrup after Vermont.\n\nIn Genoa, Ill., it was the first time in the history of the town's annual Maple Syrup Fest that the sap was not flowing from trees, putting a damper on festivities that normally include hikes into the woods to tap trees.\n\nLocally, officials say a slow start to the season should have little impact on maple-related events planned throughout March and April.\n\nBut it's too soon to tell whether the industry's difficulties will translate to higher prices for consumers buying syrup for their pancakes and waffles.\n\n\u201cIf we end up with a smaller supply, we're going to see higher prices,\u201d said Christopher Wolf, a professor of agriculture, food and resource economics at Michigan State University.\n\nPennsylvania is fifth in the nation in terms of the number of taps and production, generating about 60,000 gallons of syrup last year valued at $2 million.\n\nThis year's jittery nerves about the season's outcome follows a banner year in 2012 in which production was up because of warmer-than-usual weather in the region.\n\nIn 2013, 3.25 million gallons of maple syrup was produced nationally, up 70 percent from 2012.\n\nThe 2013 season also lasted two weeks longer than the typical four to eight weeks.\n\nFor 31 years, Everett Sechler, owner of the Sugar Shack in Confluence, has watched the maple industry ebb and flow, usually because of the temperature outside.\n\nSo he's not too worried about the slow start to this season.\n\nHe placed about 4,000 taps by Valentine's Day, about the normal time.\n\n\u201cI think this is probably the longest cold spell I can remember,\u201d Sechler said.\n\n\u201c(But this)week looks favorable. With a week of temperatures like that (in the low 50s and 40s in the day and low 20s at night), you can have a normal crop.\u201d\n\nMary Pickels is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
