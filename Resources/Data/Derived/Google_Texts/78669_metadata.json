(AP) - Nobody fully understands the rule behind a federal mandate to cut Montana power plants\u2019 carbon dioxide emission rates by nearly half over the next 15 years, but multiple groups are already jockeying to have their say in what the state ultimately recommends.\n\nIn August, the Environmental Protection Agency set targets for each state as part of President Barack Obama\u2019s plan to reduce emissions nationwide to 32 percent below 2005 levels. Montana\u2019s 2030 target is to reduce the rate of emissions by 47 percent compared to 2012.\n\nMuch of Montana\u2019s electricity generation comes from the eight working coal-fired plants in the state, resulting in one of the largest reduction requirements in the U.S., according to an analysis by the state Public Service Commission.\n\nStates have until September 2016 to submit their final plans or request a two-year extension. Officials are now exploring how to respond, even as regulators acknowledge they don\u2019t understand the 1,500-page rule and all the supporting documents just yet.\n\n\u201cA month from now we\u2019re going to understand things better and hopefully a little different than today,\u201d Montana Department of Environmental Quality air quality bureau chief David Klemp said Thursday.\n\nGov. Steve Bullock plans to form an advisory committee that will make recommendations on what actions the state will take. The Legislature also has formed a panel of lawmakers and citizens to examine the issue.\n\nThe panel\u2019s chairman, Sen. Jim Keane, D-Butte, said he expects their work to be \u201csubstantial.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to turn this over to another group and say we have to accept these findings going forward,\u201d Keane told the panel at its first meeting on Thursday.\n\nThe EPA rule says the governor will submit the state\u2019s plan, Klemp said. Bullock may go with the recommendations of his advisory council, the legislative panel or others who come up with ideas, Klemp said.\n\n\u201cAll options are on the table,\u201d he said. \u201cAll good ideas are being considered right now.\u201d\n\nAll sides are wondering whether Attorney General Tim Fox will file or join a lawsuit seeking to block the federal rule.\n\nFox hasn\u2019t decided yet, spokeswoman Anastasia Burton said Friday.\n\n\u201cThe so-called Clean Power Plan also threatens state sovereignty, Montana jobs, and the reliability and affordability of power for consumers and businesses across the country. Therefore, the Attorney General is considering appropriate next steps to challenge the regulations,\u201d Burton said in a statement.\n\nPressure by the coal industry to oppose the rule is building.\n\n\u201cI believe that the six companies that I represent would support this commission adopting a position to push back against this rule,\u201d Bud Clinch, the executive director of the Montana Coal Council, told the legislative panel.\n\nDoug Hardy, of the Montana Electric Cooperatives Association, said not enough is known yet about the rule for him to recommend a lawsuit to block the rule.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say doomsday right now but there are a lot of us who are very fearful,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nobody fully understands the rule behind a federal mandate to cut Montana power plants' carbon dioxide emission rates by nearly half over the next 15 years, but multiple groups are already jockeying to have their say in what the state ultimately recommends.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/13/montana-explores-response-to-federal-emission-cut-/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Nobody fully understands the rule behind a federal mandate to cut Montana power plants\u2019 carbon dioxide emission rates by nearly half over the next 15 years, but multiple groups are already jockeying to have their say in what the state ultimately recommends.", "title": "Montana explores response to federal emission cut mandate"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nobody fully understands the rule behind a federal mandate to cut Montana power plants' carbon dioxide emission rates by nearly half over the next 15 years, but multiple groups are already jockeying t", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Montana explores response to federal emission cut mandate"}, "Author": "MATT VOLZ", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9021\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe so-called Clean Power Plan also threatens state sovereignty, Montana jobs, and the reliability and affordability of power for consumers and businesses across the country.\n(AP) - Nobody fully understands the rule behind a federal mandate to cut Montana power plants\u2019 carbon dioxide emission rates by nearly half over the next 15 years, but multiple groups are already jockeying to have their say in what the state ultimately recommends.\nThe EPA rule says the governor will submit the state\u2019s plan, Klemp said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say doomsday right now but there are a lot of us who are very fearful,\u201d he said.\nDoug Hardy, of the Montana Electric Cooperatives Association, said not enough is known yet about the rule for him to recommend a lawsuit to block the rule."}
