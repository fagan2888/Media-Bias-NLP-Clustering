Jawbone, the maker of wireless headsets and wristbands, joined the list when it announced on Wednesday a new wearable food-tracking service will be on the market soon.\n\n\"Now, we can track the calories you consume and burn,\" Jawbone spokesman Andrew Rosenthal said, Reuters reported. The goal for the Jawbone system, he added, is to put \"all this data in context.\"\n\nWhen it comes to weight loss, there is an overwhelming plethora of fads, diets, tricks, and tips. It can be overwhelming but becoming hyperconscious of the food you eat when you\u2019re trying to stick to body-nourishing foods is key to achieving a healthier body. Whenever people keep track of their diets, they naturally tend to be more aware of the kinds of foods they\u2019re putting into their body and at what rate.\n\nAre most of my calories coming from breads, dairy, or meat protein? Seeing disproportionate amounts of unhealthy foods recorded in food diary logs can be encouragement enough to reevaluate their meal choices. Jawbone believes there\u2019s a demand for an effective food management and tracker tool, and its new Up app can supply that demand.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that behavior change is hard, and there aren\u2019t many good tools to manage that process of managing your weight,\u201d said Travis Bogard, vice president of product management and strategy at Jawbone, in an interview with VentureBeat.\n\nThere are many health trackers.
