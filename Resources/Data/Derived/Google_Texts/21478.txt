Top video game blog site Kotaku has taken note of an ecstasy/MDMA-based street drug making the rounds in Europe called “Nintendo,” with pills even stamped with the company logo. It’s been seen in Belgium.

For gamers, the news has resulted and lots and lots and lots of jokes about Mario and mushrooms and the old Nintendo Tetris-knockoff called Dr. Mario. Some Kotaku posters also joked about how selling the drug could be an actual revenue strategy by Nintendo, given that the company is not doing very well right now on the market with its most recent console.

Given the recent Smarties “scandal” it’s worth nothing the existence of the drug variation in the event coverage spreads through the media and, as inevitably as the telephone game, morphs into somebody half-reading something and trying to claim that Nintendo itself is trying to turn little kids onto drugs. After all, that’s what some people say about Walt Disney.
