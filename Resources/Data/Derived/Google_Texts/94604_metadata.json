Rand Paul (R-Ky.) was in Iowa late last week for the same reason plenty of other Republican politicians are in the Hawkeye State: he\u2019s laying the groundwork for a presidential campaign. The difference, of course, is that the Kentucky Republican\u2019s message isn\u2019t quite the same as other GOP aspirants.\n\nDave Weigel attended an event at \u201ca wine bar packed with Iowa voters,\u201d and noted Rand Paul \u201cdelivered eight minutes of remarks on the need to audit the Federal Reserve.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not surprising. The GOP senator, like his father, has taken a keen interest in the Fed and made monetary policy a centerpiece of his broader political message. The trouble is, this may be one of those issues Rand Paul cares deeply about, despite not understanding it especially well.\n\nI haven\u2019t seen a complete transcript of the senator\u2019s remarks in Iowa, but the Wall Street Journal reported on the event. \u201cOnce upon a time, your dollar was as good as gold,\u201d Paul reportedly said. \u201cThen for many decades, they said your dollar was backed by the full faith and credit of government. Do you know what it\u2019s backed by now? Used car loans, bad home loans, distressed assets and derivatives.\u201d Wall Street Journal\n\nDanny Vinik explained that the argument \u201c makes very little sense .\u201d\n\nWhen Paul asks what backs the U.S. dollar now, he\u2019s effectively asking what makes it valuable. When the U.S. used a gold standard, it meant that a dollar was worth a certain amount of gold. Economists overwhelmingly agree that that was a terrible idea, but the connection seemed to explain why dollars had value. The real reason dollars had value is the same today as it was back then: It\u2019s the only currency the government accepts to pay taxes. Businesses and consumers thus have an incentive to carry out transactions using dollars. Paul\u2019s quip about dollars being backed by \u201cused car loans, bad home loans, distressed assets and derivatives\u201d may sound good to Iowa conservatives but it betrays an incredible ignorance about the economy.\n\nWait, it gets worse. Paul went on to say the Fed\u2019s liabilities are leveraged 80 to 1 against its assets, which led him to compare the Federal Reserve to Lehman Brothers when it collapsed. As Vinik explained, this is plainly wrong , too.\n\nPaul apparently can\u2019t read the Fed\u2019s balance sheets, because as of November, its assets were $4.487 trillion and its liabilities were $4.430 trillion. Where did the $57 billion figure come from? That\u2019s its total capital. But as Cullen Roche, the founder of financial services firm Orcam Financial Group, points out, Paul also ignores the fact that the Fed remits most of its profits to the Treasury Department. In 2013, they gave Treasury nearly $80 billion. \u201cThe Federal Reserve isn\u2019t just a profitable entity,\u201d Roche writes. \u201cIt is perhaps the most profitable entity on the face of the planet.\u201d As all this shows, Paul\u2019s views on monetary policy are profoundly misguided. As long as he\u2019s in the Senate, that doesn\u2019t really matter. He can spout his nonsense without having any effect on the Federal Reserve. But if he became president, he would be responsible for choosing the next Fed Chair when Janet Yellen\u2019s term expires in 2018 and for nominating board members to the FOMC\u2026.At least on the economy, that makes Rand Paul by far the most dangerous candidate in the 2016 field.\n\nI can imagine some of Paul\u2019s defenders arguing that the senator\u2019s confusion is understandable \u2013 monetary policy is challenging. The Kentucky Republican can\u2019t be expected to have a working understanding of every issue.\n\nAnd that might even be compelling if Rand Paul hadn\u2019t chosen the Federal Reserve as one of his signature issues. It\u2019s a pillar of his \u201cmovement.\u201d We all have policy blind spots, and presidential candidates can\u2019t know everything, but this is one of the senator\u2019s main areas of interest, which he seems to know very little about.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, this is hardly the first time he\u2019s been confused about the Fed. In 2013, Paul was asked about his \u201cideal\u201d chairman for the Federal Reserve, and he endorsed Friedrich Hayek. Asked to name someone alive, Paul said Milton Friedman \u201cwould probably be pretty good.\u201d\n\nThe senator clearly didn\u2019t know that Milton Friedman is both dead and someone who would disagree with him vehemently if he were alive. Matthew O\u2019Brien explained at the time:\n\n[Paul] knows the Friedman who championed free markets and tax cuts, but not the Friedman who championed an active central bank. Paul\u2019s mistake is assuming that because he agrees with Friedman on spending, he must also agree with Friedman (and vice versa) on the Fed. That couldn\u2019t be more wrong. But it\u2019s one thing to be uninformed, and another to be unempirical. Paul doesn\u2019t seem capable of processing information that contradicts his worldview. He saw the evidence that he was wrong about Friedman and QE, and \u2026 just went on living his life like it didn\u2019t exist. Dogma won. The irony, of course, is that Milton Friedman was trying to save conservatism from people exactly like Rand Paul.\n\nClearly, the Federal Reserve belongs on the same list.\n\nAgain, these aren\u2019t just random issues; these are the issue Rand Paul himself claims to care the most about.
