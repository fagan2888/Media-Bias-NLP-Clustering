Just days after announcing the pregnancy of Asha the elephant and the birth of a male giraffe, the zoo revealed a red river hog has given birth to four piglets.\n\nThe piglets, two males and two females, were born Wednesday, October 2 to mom Divit. Their father is Sir David Pigglesworth III. Both Divit and David came to the Oklahoma City Zoo from the Los Angeles Zoo.\n\nThis is the third litter for the parents.\n\n\"Mom Divit is doing fine and all the piglets look healthy,\" said Jaimee Flinchbaugh, Zoo Hoofstock supervisor. \"The gestation period for red river hogs is about four months. We are very excited that guests will be able to enjoy watching the new piglets during the cooler temperatures this fall.\"\n\nThe piglets have not been named yet. Red river hogs originate from west and central Africa.\n\n10/7/2013 Related Story: OKC Zoo Announces Elephant Is Expecting\n\n10/1/2013 Related Story: OKC Zoo Celebrates Birth Of Female Giraffe", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Just days after announcing the pregnancy of Asha the elephant and the birth of a male giraffe, the zoo revealed a red river hog has given birth to four piglets.", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/23646662/okc-zoo-celebrates-arrival-of-red-river-babies", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/23646662_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Just days after announcing the pregnancy of Asha the elephant and the birth of a male giraffe, the zoo revealed a red river hog has given birth to four piglets.", "title": "OKC Zoo Celebrates Arrival Of 'Red River' Babies"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/23646662_SA.jpg", "description": "Just days after announcing the pregnancy of Asha the elephant and the birth of a male giraffe, the zoo revealed a red river hog has given birth to four piglets.", "card": "summary", "title": "OKC Zoo Celebrates Arrival Of 'Red River' Babies"}, "wnreadableurl": "okc-zoo-celebrates-arrival-of-red-river-babies", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2013/10/09", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,red,river,hog,piglets,birth,zoo,news 9,channel 9,kwtv,news9.com", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS24", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,red,river,hog,piglets,birth,zoo,news 9,channel 9,kwtv,news9.com"}, "article_summary": "10/7/2013 Related Story: OKC Zoo Announces Elephant Is Expecting10/1/2013 Related Story: OKC Zoo Celebrates Birth Of Female Giraffe\nRed river hogs originate from west and central Africa.\n\"The gestation period for red river hogs is about four months.\nBoth Divit and David came to the Oklahoma City Zoo from the Los Angeles Zoo.\nJust days after announcing the pregnancy of Asha the elephant and the birth of a male giraffe, the zoo revealed a red river hog has given birth to four piglets."}
