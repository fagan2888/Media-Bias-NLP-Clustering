If we miss one we have an institutionalised system in place that is system-wide. We never screw up twice and our system is able to save 30 days of lag.\n\n\u2018We send about 200-300,000 claims a day. So we need to know all the rules.\u2019\n\nNow the beauty of the Constellation billing platform is that it is scalable, which means thousands more medics can be added at negligible costs.\n\nAnd this is where Parmar\u2019s buy-and-build strategy comes into play. The entrepreneur stresses this isn\u2019t a traditional roll-up; it is simply about acquiring new customers.\n\nEarn-outs are fixed over two years so that the vendor manages the relationship and thus the clients are maintained. And it is simply a migration of doctors from the existing platform to Constellation\u2019s more tech-driven set-up.\n\nIt is certainly not about putting together culturally diverse operations and managing change \u2013 so the risks of any one deal failing are low, Parmar said.\n\n\u2018A lot of investors will say they don\u2019t like buy-and-build strategies, having had their fingers burnt before,\u2019 the Constellation CEO added.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m buying customers and relationships, not a business. I\u2019m moving them to my platform. So, there is no integration, just a transition.\n\n\u2018We look at how strong the client relationships are and we don\u2019t pay 100 per cent upfront.\n\n\u2018If we buy a company, the owner must be willing to take at least a one to two year earn out. That allows us to protect the relationship with the clients. We want them to be our spokesman.\u2019\n\n'Economies of the scale that come with rapid growth should help push operating margins to the \u2018high 40s [per cent]\u2019 from the \u2018high 30s\u2019, the CEO said.\n\nCritical mass for Parmar\u2019s Constellation would be to increase the number of clients using its platform from around 3,500 currently to 25,000, which would be transformational.\n\nBut it would still only give it a small slice of the market. There are over a million physicians in the US, while the size of the medical billing market is put at almost $60billion a year.\n\nGetting to 25,000 clients is just phase-one; there are then huge cross-selling opportunities too.\n\n\u2018This isn\u2019t just about revenue cycle management. We can sell insurance, software, HR, payroll and make them [clients] incredibly sticky and quadruple revenues,\u2019 said Parmar.\n\n\u2018A good parallel to what we are doing is Capita, which outsourced for publicly held firms and grew from an eight million pound market cap when Rodney Aldridge brought it to market to seven billion-plus market cap when he left.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "cht", "original-source": "http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/investing/article-2936385/SMALL-CAP-SHARE-IDEAS-Obamacare-creates-opportunities-medical-billing-services-firm-Constellation.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "The plethora of rule changes enacted by Obamacare have created huge upheaval for physicians, complicating the rules on payment while forcing down remuneration.", "title": "SMALL CAP SHARE IDEAS: Constellation set for boost by 'Obamacare'", "url": "http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/investing/article-2936385/SMALL-CAP-SHARE-IDEAS-Obamacare-creates-opportunities-medical-billing-services-firm-Constellation.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/02/02/24EBF9FC00000578-0-image-a-25_1422883994472.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp, noydir", "keywords": "cht", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2936385, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2015-02-02T13:33:31.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Ian+Lyall+For+Thisismoney.co.uk", "section": "Investing", "modified_time": "2015-02-02T13:53:32.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "SMALL CAP SHARE IDEAS Obamacare creates opportunities medical billing services firm Constellation"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "This is Money", "description": "The plethora of rule changes enacted by Obamacare have created huge upheaval for physicians, complicating the rules on payment while forcing down remuneration.", "title": "SMALL CAP SHARE IDEAS: Constellation set for boost by 'Obamacare'", "url": "http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/investing/article-2936385/SMALL-CAP-SHARE-IDEAS-Obamacare-creates-opportunities-medical-billing-services-firm-Constellation.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/02/02/24EBF9FC00000578-0-image-a-25_1422883994472.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "description": "The plethora of rule changes enacted by Obamacare have created huge upheaval for physicians, complicating the rules on payment while forcing down remuneration."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1b34\"", "article_summary": "So we need to know all the rules.\u2019Now the beauty of the Constellation billing platform is that it is scalable, which means thousands more medics can be added at negligible costs.\nThere are over a million physicians in the US, while the size of the medical billing market is put at almost $60billion a year.\nFor the barely profitable small firms carrying out mission-critical billing operations, Obamacare layers on a financially onerous level of bureaucracy that is often the final straw.\n\u2018The introduction of more new rules and cuts to reimbursement costs are changes a small, mom and pop billing company cannot keep up with,\u2019 said Parmar.\nConstellation, led by serial entrepreneur Paul Parmar, raised \u00a39.6million from its December IPO, which it will use, together with debt, on acquisitions."}
