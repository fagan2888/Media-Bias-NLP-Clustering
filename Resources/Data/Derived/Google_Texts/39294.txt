John Wasko marveled as the expansion of the East Suburban Family YMCA in Plum progressed and contributed financially to the project.

“I think it is significant for the community,” said Wasko, 71, of Plum, who attended a Saturday morning ribbon-cutting for the 52,000-square-foot facility. “It's like a church building, a cathedral. We are here to stay.”

About 200 people attended the program that served as a rededication of the YMCA as the Sampson Family YMCA after the late Myles D. Sampson, a real estate developer known for community and philanthropic endeavors. Sampson of Murrysville died in March 2007 at 62.

The $12 million project provided a 30,000-square-foot addition and will include remodeling the existing facility. The new Y includes a double gymnasium, six-lane lap pool, wellness center, warm-water therapy pool, teaching kitchen, expanded summer and day camp, free weights and cardiovascular equipment, spinning studio and child-watch service area for parents while they exercise.

Fundraising kicked off a few years ago with a $1 million donation from the Sampson Foundation, established in 1993.

The new fitness area opened Saturday afternoon. The pool is expected to open within a couple of weeks, said Kelli McIntyre, Sampson Family YMCA executive director.

“The YMCA has been serving the communities of Plum, Murrysville, Delmont, Oakmont, Harrison City and Monroeville for more than 40 years,” McIntyre said. “As these communities have grown in size, we must also grow to meet the changing needs of families, seniors, teens and individuals. Our new facility can serve three times the people we serve today.”
