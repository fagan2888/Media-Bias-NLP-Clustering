And, naturally, the taxpayers have picked up the tab.\n\nHere they go again\u2026according to yet another report from the Government Accountability Office which reviewed 22 of DHS\u2019s most significant projects and concluded that all but two are on track. The rest were, on average, behind schedule by about three and a half years.\n\nRelated: The Costly, Dysfunctional Lack of Oversight at DHS\n\nSome of the programs include the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s Logistics Supply Chain Management System that\u2019s supposed to help the agency coordinate with other federal entities while responding to a disaster. Anther massive program on the list is the Transportation Security Administration\u2019s (TSA) Passenger Screening Program.\n\nJust two programs got good marks-- the Customs and Border Protection's Automated Commercial Environment, or ACE, program and the Transportation Security Administration's Electronic Baggage Screening Program.\n\nOverall, the delays have added to the projects\u2019 ballooning price tags. GAO estimated that the total cost of the 22 programs is about $9.7 billion higher than originally expected. So far, 14 are behind schedule and at least half are over budget.\n\nThe auditors said they weren\u2019t able to review at least six projects because the agency didn\u2019t have approved cost estimates or schedules to measure progress even though federal policy requires those approvals.\n\nThe GAO attributed the cost overruns and schedule delays to staffing issues, technical difficulties with IT systems and funding shortages.\n\nThis \u201cincreases the likelihood that acquisition programs' schedules will slip and costs will grow,\" the report said.\n\nAn earlier GAO report slammed the Program Accountability and Risk Management (PARM) office in charge of keeping track of the programs\u2019 costs\u2014saying it wasn\u2019t assuring that DHS was submitting all of the appropriate documents to make budget projections.\n\nRelated: DHS Whistleblowers Will Save $100 Million This Year\n\nThe auditors recommended that PARM put in place a policy to ensure the agency is documenting all of the correct information to have a better idea of how much the projects will cost going forward.\n\nFor its part, DHS responded to the GAO saying it\u2019s currently taking steps to address the challenges.\n\nThe auditors said \u201cit will likely take years to fully resolve the challenges.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Nearly all of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s largest and most e", "title": "DHS Blows Another $9.7 Billion on Mismanaged Programs", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/28/DHS-Blows-Another-97-Billion-Mismanaged-Programs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Homeland_Security_Sign.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/28/DHS-Blows-Another-97-Billion-Mismanaged-Programs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Homeland_Security_Sign.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Nearly all of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s largest and most e", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfc26\"", "article_summary": "GAO estimated that the total cost of the 22 programs is about $9.7 billion higher than originally expected.\nFor its part, DHS responded to the GAO saying it\u2019s currently taking steps to address the challenges.\nThe GAO attributed the cost overruns and schedule delays to staffing issues, technical difficulties with IT systems and funding shortages.\nThis \u201cincreases the likelihood that acquisition programs' schedules will slip and costs will grow,\" the report said.\nNearly all of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s largest and most expensive projects have soared over budget and slid behind schedule, delaying important programs vital to national security."}
