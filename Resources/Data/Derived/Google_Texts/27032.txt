CANNES, France (AP) — For much of its running time, Jacques Audiard’s new film, “Dheepan,” is a gritty and naturalistic depiction of Tamil refugees trying to build a new life in France.

That’s a long way from where the project began, as a remake of Sam Peckinpah’s violent revenge thriller, “Straw Dogs.”

“That was the origin of the origin,” Audiard said. “At the beginning, it was a kind of vigilante movie.”

The French director has long mixed genre-movie conventions and tough real-world subjects into powerful and distinctive films. His international breakthrough, “A Prophet,” reinvented the prison drama, while follow-up “Rust and Bone” was inspired by B-movie melodramas.

“For me, genre is a Trojan Horse,” Audiard said — a way of smuggling surprises past the audience’s defenses.

“Dheepan” is part social-issues drama, as it follows former Tamil Tiger fighter Dheepan (Antonythasan Jesuthasan), 20-something woman Yalini (Kalieaswari Srinivasan) and 9-year-old Illayaal (Claudine Vinasithamby), refugees from the war in Sri Lanka.

The three pose as a family in order to come to France, where Dheepan gets a job as caretaker at a high-rise housing project on the outskirts of Paris.

Audiard shows the trio’s first steps toward a new life, before the violence they thought they had left behind erupts in a bloody climax that reveals the film’s vigilante-flick origins. But “Dheepan” also has the bruised-and-battered tenderness that marked Audiard’s earlier films.

“What is really at the heart is the love story,” the director said during an interview Saturday. “How are we going to get from a fake family to a real family? How can we get from antagonism to love?”

“Dheepan” is one of a handful of films considered strong contenders for the top trophy at Cannes, where “A Prophet” won the second-place prize in 2009.
