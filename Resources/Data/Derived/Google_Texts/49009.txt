Re: “Jewish Colorado brings kosher meals to seniors,” Jan. 3 news story.

I take great exception to the statement in your article that food delivered to Arnie Sherwood was “blessed by a rabbi before it arrived on his doorstep.”

Kosher food is not “blessed by a rabbi.” It is prepared under rabbinical supervision to be sure that it meets the standards of kashrut (being kosher) — which includes content (no non-kosher items, such as pork or shellfish), cleanliness (no bugs), and if meat, fish or fowl the health of the animal and a humane slaughter.

The statement that kosher food is “blessed by a rabbi” is not only incorrect, it has a negative and condescending tone and I have often heard people say this in mocking kosher food.
