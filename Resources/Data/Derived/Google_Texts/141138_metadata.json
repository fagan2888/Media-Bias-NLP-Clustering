Unfortunately millions of his readers believed they were seeing an accurate picture. In fact Clancy got the details right, but most of the big things totally wrong. Gorbachev was not a wise leader; Prince Charles was not a great family man; Federal agents seldom feel agonies of guilt when killing people in the line of duty. A full listing of Clancy\u2019s distortions would fill a book almost as long as one of Clancy\u2019s. Here one of our top geopolitical experts paints a picture of Tom Clancy, showing how he gained a place on our bookshelves by giving us what we wanted.\n\n\u201cTom Clancy, Military Man\u201c\n\nBy Andrew Bacevich\n\nThe Baffler, #24 2014: \u201cThe journal that blunts the cutting edge.\u201d\n\nReposted with the generous permission of The Baffler\n\nWord of Tom Clancy\u2019s passing in October reached me at a local gym. Peddling away on an elliptical trainer, I welcomed the distraction of this \u201cbreaking news\u201d story as it swept across a bank of video monitors suspended above the cardio machines. On cable networks and local stations, anchors were soon competing with one another to help viewers grasp the story\u2019s significance. Winning the competition (and perhaps an audition with Fox News) was the young newsreader who solemnly announced that \u201cone of America\u2019s greatest writers\u201d had just died at the relatively early age of sixty-six.\n\nOf course, Tom Clancy qualifies as a great writer in the same sense that Texas senator Ted Cruz qualifies as a great orator. Both satisfy a quantitative definition of eminence. Although political historians are unlikely to rank Cruz alongside Clay, Calhoun, and Webster, his recent twenty-one-hour-long denunciation of Obamacare, delivered before a near-empty Senate chamber, demonstrated a capacity for narcissistic logorrhea rare even by Washington standards.\n\nSo too with Clancy. Up in the literary Great Beyond, Faulkner and Hemingway won\u2019t be inviting him for drinks. Yet, as with Ted Cruz, once Clancy got going there was no shutting him up. Following a slow start, the works of fiction and nonfiction that he wrote, cowrote, or attached his moniker to numbered in the dozens. Some seventeen Clancy novels made it to the top of the New York Times bestseller list, starting with his breakthrough thriller The Hunt for Red October. A slew of titles written by others appeared with his imprimatur. Thus, for example, Tom Clancy\u2019s Ghost Recon: Choke Point or Tom Clancy\u2019s Splinter Cell: Blacklist Aftermath.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, on those occasions when Clancy partnered with some retired U.S. four-star to craft the officer\u2019s memoirs, the result was a tome \u201cby\u201d Tom Clancy \u201cwith\u201d General So-and-So, the difference in font size signaling who was the bigger cheese. And then there is Tom Clancy\u2019s Military Reference series, another product line in the realm of fictive nonfiction. Each title \u2014 Fighter Wing, for example, or Armored Cav \u2014 promises a Clancy-led \u201cguided tour\u201d of what really goes on in the elite corners of the United States military.\n\nClancy did for military pop-lit what Starbucks did for the preparation of caffeinated beverages: he launched a sprawling, massively profitable industrial enterprise that simultaneously serves and cultivates an insatiable customer base. Whether the item consumed provides much in terms of nourishment is utterly beside the point. That it tastes yummy going down more than suffices to keep customers coming back.\n\nIf Clancy was a hack, as he surely was, he was a hack who possessed a remarkable talent for delivering what his fans craved. Nor did the Tom Clancy brand confine itself to the written word. His oeuvre has provided ideal fodder for Hollywood too. Movie adaptations chronicling the exploits of Jack Ryan, Clancy\u2019s principal protagonist, and starring the likes of Harrison Ford, Alec Baldwin, and Ben Affleck, became blockbuster hits. Then there are the testosterone-laced videogames, carrying titles like Tom Clancy\u2019s Ghost Recon: Future Soldier and Tom Clancy\u2019s Rainbow Six: Vegas 2.\n\nClancy-approved videogames captured the Pentagon\u2019s fancy. In 2007, Red Storm Entertainment, the gaming arm of Clancy\u2019s empire, released America\u2019s Army: True Soldiers, advertised as an \u201cOfficial U.S. Army Game.\u201d (\u201cCreated by Soldiers. Developed by Gamers. Tested by Heroes.\u201d) The accompanying copy assures prospective purchasers/recruits that \u201ccombat action doesn\u2019t get any more authentic than this\u201d:\n\nBecome one of America\u2019s bravest in this game developed in conjunction with the U.S. Army. See what it\u2019s like to live life as an infantryman. Take on the role of a Rifleman, Grenadier, Automatic Rifleman, or Sniper. Develop skills including Valor, Marksmanship, Stealth, and more.\n\nHere profit and propaganda blend into a seamless package.\n\nDid I mention Clancy-themed board games, music CDs, toys, and apparel? There is even a Clancy line of pseudo-military collectibles. Among the items available for purchase is the Ghost Recon \u201cFuture Soldier\u201d \u2014 your choice: statuette or stuffed toy.\n\nDon\u2019t expect Clancy\u2019s departure to stem this tsunami of stuff. Although the founder himself may have left the scene, Clancy Inc. gives every indication of carrying on. A new Clancy novel called Command Authority arrived in December. And a new Jack Ryan movie, this one not based on previously published material, is in the works.\n\nYet to argue that Clancy\u2019s books and ancillary byproducts offer little in terms of lasting value is not to say that they have lacked influence. Indeed, just the reverse is true. As a shaper of the zeitgeist, Tom Clancy may well rate as one of the most influential creative entrepreneurs of the last several decades.\n\nIn whatever medium, Clancy\u2019s abiding theme is the never-ending struggle between good guys and bad guys. His bad guys tend to be irredeemably bad. His good guys are invariably very, very good \u2014 Americans devoted to the cause of keeping their countrymen safe and the world free. As good guys, they subscribe to old-fashioned virtues while making skillful use of the latest technology. Whether garbed in battledress or trenchcoats, they are cool, professional, dedicated, resourceful, and exceedingly competent. These are, of course, the very qualities that Americans today ascribe to those who actually serve in uniform or who inhabit the \u201cblack world,\u201d whether as CIA agents or members of highly specialized units such as Delta Force or SEAL Team Six.\n\nWhat\u2019s worth recalling is that the prevailing view of America\u2019s warriors was not always so favorable. In the wake of Vietnam, shortly before Clancy burst onto the scene, the books that sold and the scripts attracting Hollywood\u2019s attention told a different story. Those inhabiting positions of responsibility in the United States military were either venal careerists or bunglers out of their depth. Those on the front lines were victims or saps. When it came to military-themed accessories, the preferred logo was FTA.\n\nClancy was among the first to intuit that the antimilitary mood spawned by Vietnam represented an opportunity. The legions who did not find Catch-22 particularly amusing, who were more annoyed than entertained by M*A*S*H, and who classified Jane Fonda as a traitor were hungry to find someone to validate their views \u2014 someone who still believed in the red, white, and blue and who still admired those fighting to defend it. Clancy offered himself as that someone.\n\nTo be more accurate, Ronald Reagan had already offered himself as that someone. What Clancy did was seize the role of Reagan\u2019s literary doppelg\u00e4nger \u2014 what the Gipper might have become had he chosen writing instead of politics after ending his acting career.\n\nClancy\u2019s own career took off when President Reagan plugged Red October as \u201cmy kind of yarn.\u201d As well he might: Clancy shared Reagan\u2019s worldview. His stories translated that worldview into something that seemed \u201creal\u201d and might actually become real if you believed hard enough. Reagan was famous for transforming the imagined into the actual; despite never having left Hollywood during World War II, he knew, for example, that he had personally witnessed the liberation of Nazi death camps. Similarly, Clancy, who never served in the military, imagined a world of selfless patriots performing feats of derring-do to overcome evil \u2014 a world that large numbers of Americans were certain had once existed. More to the point, it was a world they desperately wanted to restore. Clancy, like Reagan, made that restoration seem eminently possible.\n\nSoon after Clancy\u2019s death, the Washington Post published an appreciation entitled \u201cHow Tom Clancy Made the Military Cool Again,\u201d written by a couple of self-described Gen-Xer policy wonks. \u201cClancy\u2019s legacy lives on in the generations he introduced to the military,\u201d they gushed, crediting Clancy with having \u201ccreated a literary bridge across the civil-military divide.\u201d His \u201cstories helped the rest of society understand and imagine\u201d the world of spooks and soldiers. Perhaps not surprisingly, those who served or aspired to serve found those stories to be especially gratifying. Clancy depicted American soldiers and would-be soldiers precisely as they wished to see themselves.\n\nBut any understanding gained by either soldiers or society,whether engaged in Patriot Games or fending off The Sum of All Fears, was illusory, rooted in fantasies that sanitized war and conveyed a false sense of what military service really entails. Instead of bridging the civil-military divide, Clancy papered it over, thereby perpetuating it. By extension, he contributed in no small way to the conditions breeding the misguided and costly military adventurism that has become the signature of U.S. policy.\n\nClancy did prove to be a figure of consequence. Alas, almost all of those consequences have proven to be pernicious. And there\u2019s no Jack Ryan anywhere in sight to come to our rescue.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n\nAbout the author\n\nAndrew J.
