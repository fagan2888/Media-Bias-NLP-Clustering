Last season, the Arvada Center artistic director headed into theater\u2019s cavernous vault, dug out and dusted off \u201cMan of La Mancha,\u201d the musical with the impossibly corny, and just as stirring, anthem \u201cThe Impossible Dream (The Quest).\u201d\n\nThe production was a winner.\n\nNow comes another oldie, \u201cCamelot,\u201d which runs through Oct. 6.\n\nTheater loves its revivals, but some works feel creakier than others. Which didn\u2019t halt Arvada patrons from voting \u201cCamelot\u201d among the shows they most wanted to see produced.\n\nSo how does a director go about refreshing a classic like Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe\u2019s \u201cCamelot\u201d? Thoughtfully. With care. And, it turns out, with a small dose of willed ignorance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a big fan of King Arthur and the legends,\u201d Lansberry said on the phone. \u201cBut I can also tell you I\u2019ve never seen a production of \u2018Camelot.\u2019 I\u2019ve never seen the movie. Purposefully, for this period of going into the show, I stay away from anything like that.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s something of an achievement for a theater pro. The 1960 stage production boasted a legendary cast in Richard Burton as King Arthur, Julie Andrews as Guinevere and Robert Goulet as the round-table knight Lancelot. The original cast album reached the No. 1 spot on the pop charts in 1961, propelled by Lancelot\u2019s \u201cIf Ever I Would Leave You\u201d and Guinevere\u2019s \u201cI Loved You Once in Silence.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t even listened to the cast album. I don\u2019t want those ideas in my head. I want a clean start,\u201d said the director.\n\nHe encouraged a similar tactic for his actors: David Bryant Johnson (Arthur), Melissa Mitchell (Guinevere) and Glenn Seven Allen (Lancelot). \u201cI contacted the cast and said, If you want to go through the score, through the book, OK, but don\u2019t set the character. I want to work with you and find that character with the four of us \u2014 so it comes more naturally.\u201d\n\nWhile Lansberry has avoided versions of Lerner and Loewe\u2019s musical, he\u2019s spent ample time poring over their source: T.H. White\u2019s 1958 novel \u201cThe Once and Future King.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much contradiction between T.H. White\u2019s book and Lerner and Loewe\u2019s approach to it and to the reality of what King Arthur was. My whole approach is what I refer to as \u2018historical fiction.\u2019 \u201c\n\nLansberry flirted with taking a page from HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d which is set in a fantasy epoch rife with medieval-seeming machinations. \u201cI\u2019d only seen some of the clips and some of the commercials. I thought that\u2019s a great look.\u201d Then he saw the show, which famously turned a wedding feast into a bloodbath. \u201cO my god, it\u2019s the most gory thing I\u2019ve ever seen. I had no idea,\u201d he says. \u201cOK, let\u2019s leave that part out. The look is similar to what I want but not the action.\u201d\n\nBeing the artistic director of a theater company requires an agile grasp of one\u2019s audience. Nudge but never shove might be a description of the mission to remain innovative but also respectful, especially when presenting a known work.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s \u2018Man of La Mancha\u2019 or \u2018Chess,\u2019 I really try to create a new experience. One of my buzz phrases is, \u2018You may have seen a production before, but you haven\u2019t seen it at the Arvada Center,\u2019 and I try to live true to that.\u201d\n\nLansberry has cast the lead roles with younger actors, he says, \u201cin part, because of the life expectancy of the setting.\u201d It also provides a more logical progression of the love triangle. \u201cThey\u2019re younger so their feelings and emotions aren\u2019t tainted by years of experience.\u201d\n\nThere is one thing he knew not to touch, however.\n\n\u201cIf you go back to the original book, Lancelot \u2014 whom everybody knows as Robert Goulet or some amazingly handsome man \u2014 was ugly. He\u2019s described as having big ears, a pocked face. There was nothing attractive about him, and I thought, \u2018That won\u2019t play.\u2019 \u201d He laughs. \u201cThey\u2019re just not going to go there.\u201d\n\nLisa Kennedy: 303-954-1567, lkennedy@denverpost.com or twitter.com/bylisakennedy\n\n\u201cCAMELOT.\u201d Book and Lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner.
