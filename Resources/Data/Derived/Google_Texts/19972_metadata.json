Though, the committee dropped one provision from the bill.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u2014 The bill still repeals the individual and employer mandates, as well as the Cadillac and medical device taxes. However, the committee supported Budget Chairman Tom Price's amendment dropping repeal of the Independent Payment Advisory Board after a ruling from the Senate parliamentarian. The bill also defunds Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe House is expected to vote on the measure Friday. The White House issued a veto threat last night, saying the bill would \"take away critical benefits and health care coverage from hard-working middle-class families.\"\n\nW&M CHAIR UP FOR GRABS? \u2014 If Rep. Paul Ryan becomes speaker, Rep. Pat Tiberi is planning to run for chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee. Rep. Kevin Brady is also expected to run for the spot. The Pro story.\n\n\u2014 The House Freedom Caucus last night said it won't endorse Ryan, but a \"super majority\" of members will vote for him. Following the announcement, Ryan tweeted that it was \"a positive step toward a unified Republican team.\"\n\nGOOD THURSDAY MORNING and welcome to PULSE, where we can already feel House Speaker John Boehner's excitement reverberating from the Capitol in anticipation of freedom.

The nonpartisan number crunchers said scrapping the Cadillac tax would reduce projected revenues by $109 billion over 10 years while cutting anticipated spending by $18 billion. The estimate was part of a larger budget score of the House reconciliation bill.

But the company took another blow when stock commentary site Citron Research issued a report accusing Valeant of using specialty pharmacies to store its drugs and record the transactions as sales. The Citron report, which CNBC notes comes from a company that has a controversial reputation of its own, also comes on the heels of a New York Times story earlier this week that questioned the industry's improper use of specialty pharmacies. CNBC\u2019s story: http://cnb.cx/1jB0US4. NYT\u2019s story: http://nyti.ms/1NUsQwV.\n\n\u2026 Valeant quickly issued a press release calling Citron\u2019s report erroneous, saying there is no sales benefit to any inventory it holds at specialty pharmacies: http://cnb.cx/1jB0US4. But Valeant\u2019s situation may be putting the entire industry under a microscope. Allergan even issued a release after the Valeant news broke Wednesday to make clear it very sparingly uses specialty pharmacies. Industry analyst Ronny Gal issued a note on specialty pharmacies Wednesday, noting \u201cthe market reacted strongly\u201d to the NYT story. The core services provided by specialty pharmacies are not illegal, Gal said. \u201cAs for immoral \u2014 it\u2019s a matter of perspective,\u201d he said, noting that payers often see drug companies' use of the pharmacies as undermining their attempts to control costs through co-pays and drug tiering. Gal cautioned that the industry is \u201cyoung\u201d and \u201cmay be under regulated.\u201d\n\n** A message from PhRMA: Through personalized medicine, doctors and researchers are better able to direct patient care across health care, from risk assessment and prevention, to detection, diagnosis, treatment, and disease management.

The group launched after the rollout of Gilead\u2019s pricey hepatitis C treatment, Sovaldi, and has worked to draw media coverage of high prescription drug costs. \u201cJust as consumers are feeling the unsustainable cost pressure on prescription medications, so are the hospitals that purchase these essential, lifesaving prescription drugs for our patients in our care,\u201d FAH CEO Chip Kahn said in a statement. The American Hospital Association is already a member.\n\nOBAMA, BURWELL TALK OPIOIDS IN WEST VIRGINIA \u2014 The president, HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell and White House drug czar Michael Botticelli shared the stage Wednesday afternoon with West Virginians who are engaged in the battle against opioid abuse, including a local parent of a heroin addict, a police chief and a doctor. Obama said a bipartisan consensus had emerged that there should be greater emphasis on treatment over incarceration of drug abusers, \u201cbut budgets hadn\u2019t caught up with the insight.\u201d CDC is working on guidelines meant to rein in overprescribing. Video of the event, which included emotional stories of families\u2019 struggles with abuse: http://1.usa.gov/1NocAB6\n\n\u2026 GOP Sens. Lamar Alexander and Chuck Grassley welcomed the White House action, especially on an issue that both had raised in the past \u2014 whether Medicare patient satisfaction surveys incentivize doctors to overprescribe painkillers to boost their scores. HHS will study that issue. A fact sheet on the White House push: http://1.usa.gov/1GTI6Cm\n\n\u2026 While providers are committing to new training, insurers have also engaged. The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association is funding a PBS documentary on opioid addiction and highlights other actions taken by its members here: http://politico.pro/1jBvevR\n\nDISPATCHES FROM WISCONSIN: Pro's Rachana Pradhan reports from Wisconsin: A massive collaboration among eight Wisconsin health systems to pool resources and boost quality isn\u2019t just a gateway for mergers down the road, Aurora Health Care CEO Nick Turkal told reporters this week. The AboutHealth network \u2014 which also boasts big names such as the Marshfield Clinic and UW Health, and whose entities have a combined annual operating revenue of nearly $12 billion \u2014 was set up as a statewide partnership to boost providers\u2019 efficiency and lower costs through higher health care quality. But Turkal said the systems want to maintain their local brands because of the power that has in their individual localities. \u201cNone of them have an interest in forming one big company,\" he said. \"There is no discussion of that.\"\n\nSENATORS: FINALIZE THE RULE ON E-CIGS ALREADY \u2014 A group of Democratic senators are pushing OMB to finish reviewing a \u201clong-overdue\u201d rule to regulate e-cigarettes and other forms of tobacco as soon as possible. In a letter to OMB Director Shaun Donovan, the senators urged the administration to include strong guidelines that prevent young people from using tobacco products. Their suggestions include limiting advertising, adding health warnings on the products, banning the use of flavorings, and requiring childproof packaging for e-liquids. The senators also asked the administration not to grandfather products from reviews to determine whether they constitute threats to public health.\n\nGROUP: CDC SHIFTING AWAY FROM RESEARCH ON TERTIARY PREVENTION OF TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES \u2014 The Brain Injury Association of America sent a letter to the CDC this week expressing its concern that the agency is shifting away from research on secondary and tertiary prevention of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The group notes that the agency\u2019s Injury Research Agenda for 2009 to 2018 reflects \u201cthe most immediate TBI-related research needs and those that should be supported first as resources become available.\u201d They ask that CDC clarifies its intent to continue recognizing and supporting Tier 1 TBI research priorities over the next five years.\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING, by Erin Mershon\n\nFormer Sen.

First, we need strong intellectual property protections and robust funding of the entire R&D ecosystem. Second, we need a clear and transparent regulatory framework for the development of targeted therapies and co-developed diagnostics. Finally, we need value assessments and emerging payment models that are patient-centered and align with the way value emerges/changes over time.

That means a long trip or higher copays to stick with the pharmacies that patients like. In urban areas, these plans often fail to meet the government\u2019s standard for pharmacy access. In rural areas, \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacies are often 20+ miles away! Support H.R. 793 / S. 1190. This bipartisan legislation is supported by leading consumer advocates and would let patients use any pharmacy willing to accept the \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacy terms and conditions.
