The mind of the media is always in the room in a presidential election, but the real player is its heart: as fickle and harsh as a femme fatale.

It's apparent the political media is champing for a showdown between brash Donald Trump and underdog Bernie Sanders. That captures their imagination as an authentic American tale: the mogul versus the Socialist Vermont senator with a Brooklyn accent. That's the story they long to write and tell.

The media's heart had several suitors going into the 2016 cycle, and it has flirted with a few darlings, contenders and a drop-out, Texas Gov. Rick Perry. The media's heart swore never again to fall for a Texas governor, as it did in 2000 with George W. Bush. Even sanguine sage CBS newsman Bob Schieffer (a Texan) thought Bush and the older Dick Cheney made a swell team. It had never been so wrong since the "Dewey Defeats Truman" front page in 1948.

The private e-mail server story has proved a perfect storm of seizing upon a true flaw, Clinton's penchant for secrecy, and stoking it with the media's worst fears about her.
