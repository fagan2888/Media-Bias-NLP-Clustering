It\u2019s definitely festive, but the execution is a bit lacking, Kocon concluded. Glowing Nativity scene figures are mixed and matched with snowmen, Santa, reindeer and woodland creatures.\n\nPerhaps the homeowner should have reined it in? Nah. When it comes to holiday lights, more is better!\n\nAll Kocon wants for Christmas is a slightly more cohesive front lawn.\n\n\u201cI might have built an igloo,\u201d he said, pointing to one grouping of figures, to pull the whole scene together.\n\nAs a member of the Coon Rapids Arts Commission, Kocon is one of four judges for the city\u2019s annual lighting contest.\n\nContests like this are one way communities make the holidays bright. In Coon Rapids, there\u2019s prize money on the line \u2014 $50 in several categories and $100 for an overall grand prize \u2014 but it\u2019s really about bragging rights.\n\nWhat it takes\n\nOn a recent snowy night, the Coon Rapids judges set out in a Dodge minivan to evaluate the entrants and crown the winners. They pulled back the curtain, allowing the Star Tribune to witness the judging.\n\nWhat takes an ordinary holiday lights display and amps it up to an award winner?\n\nIt\u2019s a mix of precision, neatness, overall appeal and originality. Those are the categories used to evaluate entrants.\n\nCookies from homeowners don\u2019t hurt, either. Last year, an entrant ran out with some sweets, scoring some extra brownie points with the judges. But actually, the cookies weren\u2019t enough; the home wasn\u2019t a prize winner.\n\nEach judge scores each entrant, comparing overall scores over ale at a local tavern afterward.\n\nAll four judges get out of the van to check out the split-level on Vintage Street. The front of the house is awash in lights \u2014 Clark Griswold style. A projection of Santa frolics in the front window. Every tree, rail and surface in the front lawn is covered in lights, pulsing to music.\n\nNow this speaks to the judges. Snoopy would be proud.\n\n\u201cWhen you put a lot of thought into the theme, it works out well,\u201d says Kocon, as he snaps photos of the house.\n\nThe house, adorned with 85,000 twinkle lights, ultimately takes the grand prize. It was also a prize winner last year.\n\n\u201cI ask them to make out the prize check directly to the electric company,\u201d quipped homeowner and winner Tim Yohnk.\n\n\u2018A monster of its own making\u2019\n\nYohnk said he thinks about his holiday display all year but starts checking lights and hardware in late summer.\n\n\u201cI am already thinking about next year\u2019s show today,\u201d said Yohnk, a facilities manager. \u201cI have a strand of lights on every inch of the face of my house.\u201d\n\nHe started going all out with the display about five years ago.\n\n\u201cAfter you\u2019ve done it one year, it\u2019s a monster of its own making. Everyone asks, \u2018What are you doing this year?\u2019\u201d Yohnk said. \u201cI enjoy Christmas and it makes so many other people smile, so it\u2019s worth it.\u201d\n\nYohnk enlists the help of his wife, Penny, to string lights.\n\n\u201cYou have to have full family support when you do something like this,\u201d Yohnk explains.\n\nHis formula for success: Focus on the lighting; avoid the blowup figures and other lawn ornament fads.\n\nLater, judges pull in front of a home on Crook Lake Boulevard, which goes on to win best static light display. The rambler is awash in blue lights except for strands of white lights radiating down from a star. A large American flag waves in the center of the display.\n\nIs mixing holidays a faux pas?\n\nNah. Remember, when it comes to Christmas lights, more is better!\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t hurt,\u201d said judge and Arts Commission chairwoman Mary Ann Kehn, surveying the display. \u201cThe star at the top is very pretty.\u201d\n\nThe annual lighting contest and the city\u2019s photo contest are why Kocon joined the arts commission in the first place.\n\n\u201cIt creates camaraderie in the community,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s stuff where you can get involved without spending a lot of money.\u201d\n\nKocon has been on the other side of the strand. His uncle is a multiple holiday light award winner in Columbia Heights.\n\n\u201cHe got me started,\u201d Kocon said.\n\nKocon said he understands the surge of excitement when you take some strands of lights, some ingenuity and a love of Christmas and create a twinkling, pulsing showstopper.\n\n\u201cWhen you see five or six cars lined up outside, it\u2019s just a thrill,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile some displays twinkle a bit more brightly, the judges are complimentary of all the entrants.\n\n\u201cYou have to appreciate the effort. Most people don\u2019t even do that,\u201d Kocon said.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Judges for Coon Rapids' annual contest shed light on what makes a holiday display brilliant.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Judges for Coon Rapids' annual contest shed light on what makes a holiday display brilliant.", "title": "Lights contests amp up community spirit in Coon Rapids", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/lights-contests-amp-up-community-spirit-in-coon-rapids/237162971/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_138790454930885.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_138790454930885.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Judges for Coon Rapids' annual contest shed light on what makes a holiday display brilliant.", "title": "Lights contests amp up community spirit in Coon Rapids", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/lights-contests-amp-up-community-spirit-in-coon-rapids/237162971/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_138790454930885.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_138790454930885.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "article": {"tag": "Coon Rapids"}, "news_keywords": "Christmas,decorations,contest,lighting contest,Coon Rapids"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd804c\"", "article_summary": "What it takesOn a recent snowy night, the Coon Rapids judges set out in a Dodge minivan to evaluate the entrants and crown the winners.\nWhat takes an ordinary holiday lights display and amps it up to an award winner?\nAs a member of the Coon Rapids Arts Commission, Kocon is one of four judges for the city\u2019s annual lighting contest.\nThe Coon Rapids homeowners went all in on the dozens of illuminated lawn figures splashed across the yard.\nIn Coon Rapids, there\u2019s prize money on the line \u2014 $50 in several categories and $100 for an overall grand prize \u2014 but it\u2019s really about bragging rights."}
