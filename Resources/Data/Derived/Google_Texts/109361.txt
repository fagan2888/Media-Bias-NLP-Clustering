Two women found dead in a vehicle submerged in the Fryingpan River Saturday were from Columbus, Ohio, Eagle County Coroner Kara Bettis said.

Authorities still don’t know exactly when the sports utility vehicle containing Kristina Herron, 64, and Yvonne Honybrink, 71, went into the water, Colorado State Patrol spokesman Sgt. Rob Madden, said Sunday.

The women were pronounced dead at the scene.

The Basalt Fire Department responded to a report of the submerged vehicle at about 4:40 p.m., Madden said.

“Upon our arrival, the fire department was removing it from the water,” he said. “It was fully submerged.”

The 2016 Kia Sedona was heading north on Fryingpan Road when it went off the right side.

The SUV rolled for 30 feet before hitting a post, then travelled another 70 feet down an embankment before going into the river.

“The big question is going to be when did the crash actually occur,” Madden said.
