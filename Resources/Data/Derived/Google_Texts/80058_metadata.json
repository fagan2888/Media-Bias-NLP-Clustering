The outcome is a major defeat for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), who has struggled to govern even as Republicans hold unified control of Congress.\n\nRelated: Homeland Security Chief Worried about a Shabaab Mall Threat\n\nThe House GOP plan, which failed on a 203-224 vote, was meant as fallback proposal that Boehner put forth because the House and Senate have been unable to reach an agreement on a more lasting funding bill.\n\nSpeaking on the House floor after the vote, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told members they should stand by for possible additional votes later Friday or during the weekend.\n\nBefore the vote, Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva (D-Ariz.), who represents a long stretch of the nation\u2019s border with Mexico, said he was concerned that a Homeland Security shutdown would be devastating to the flow of goods -- particularly perishable fruits and vegetables -- across the border.\n\nBut he said he didn\u2019t plan to vote for the three-week extension, noting that the delay would not change the political fundamentals of the impasse.\n\n\u201cThe bullet must get bit by Boehner,\u201d he said. \u201cIt either gets bit tonight ... or it gets bit in three weeks.\u201d\n\nRelated: Factbox\u2014What Happens If Homeland Security Funding Lapses?\n\nThe Senate passed its own bill Friday morning that would fund DHS through September and would not touch Obama\u2019s immigration directives. The House passed a bill weeks ago that would fund DHS for the same period and would undo Obama\u2019s directives.\n\nResistance in both chambers to the other one\u2019s bill left lawmakers scrambling for an interim solution. The stopgap bill would have funded DHS through March 19.\n\nThe House passed a measure earlier Friday afternoon to go to conference with the Senate to hash out the differences between their long-term bills. No Democrats voted for it. Senate Democrats oppose a conference.\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Obama would sign a short-term bill, even though he would prefer a lengthier one.\n\n\u201cIf president is faced with a choice of having the Department of Homeland Security shut down or fund that department for a short term, the president is not going to allow the agency to shut down,\u201d said Earnest.\n\nRelated: Boehner Ready to Let Funding Lapse for Homeland Security\n\nThe speaker summoned his top lieutenants to a meeting in his office Friday afternoon as Republicans planned to move ahead on the stopgap bill, but there were signs that securing enough Republican votes remained a concern.\n\nDemocratic resistance complicated matters, though House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) conceded Friday morning that \u201cRepublicans probably\u201d had the votes to pass the bill to keep the department open.\n\nBut she called the measure a \u201cstaggering failure of leadership that will prolong this manufactured crisis of theirs and endanger the security of the American people.\u201d\n\nPelosi\u2019s remarks came after House Democratic leaders huddled with rank-and-file members. Leaving the meeting, some expressed sharp opposition to the stopgap measure.\n\n\u201cThis is a gimmick. This is a waste of time,\u201d said Rep. Nita M. Lowey (N.Y.), the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. \u201cWe need a one-year bill and that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nSenate Democratic aides acknowledged that the bill would probably have passed their chamber if it had cleared the House.\n\nRelated: Arrest of ISIS Backers Shows Need for Homeland Security Funding\n\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) put forward the Senate bill that passed Friday morning after it became clear the long-term House bill would not advance in his chamber. McConnell\u2019s strategy has been panned by some House conservatives bent on battling Obama on immigration.\n\nAs they left Thursday\u2019s House GOP meeting, Republican members said their leadership presented its plan as a way to get to conference with the Senate on their competing bills.\n\nMcConnell also tried to move forward Friday morning to consideration of a standalone measure that would undo Obama\u2019s 2014 immigration actions, including stemming the deportations of millions of undocumented immigrants, but was blocked by Democrats. That bill is an effort to assuage conservatives in both chambers.\n\n\u201cRemember: President Obama said more than 20 times he couldn\u2019t take those kinds of actions. He even referred to overreach like that as \u2018ignoring the law,\u2019 \u201d McConnell said on the Senate floor.\n\nRelated: Will the House Follow Ted Cruz and Vote to Fund DHS?\n\nSenate Democratic leaders say they want to see DHS fully funded before they clear the way for consideration on the immigration bill.\n\nDemocrats have pointed to dangers the United States is confronting as the DHS debate is unfolding. They have cited the threat of the Islamic State, the mass shooting at a French satirical newspaper and concerns about disaster preparedness as reasons why Congress should not delay passage of \u201cclean\u201d bill that funds DHS through September.\n\nAt least one member has said he would forgo pay during a DHS shutdown, in solidarity with nonessential employees facing the prospect of a furlough.\n\n\u201cAs long as the employees of the Department of Homeland Security including Border Patrol, Coast Guard and TSA are working while not receiving paychecks, I will ask that my paycheck be withheld,\u201d Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) said in a Thursday statement.\n\nRep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.), a conservative critic of GOP leadership, said Thursday that Boehner is handling the DHS fight \u201cas best as can be expected.\u201d But in a sign of lingering House-Senate tension, Huelskamp lashed out at McConnell.\n\n\u201cHarry Reid\u2019s still in charge. There are going to be millions of folks that helped change the Senate from Democrat to Republican [who] are going to be disappointed in Senator McConnell,\u201d he said.\n\nPaul Kane contributed to this story.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The House failed to pass a 20-day stopgap bill to fund the Department of Homeland Secu", "title": "Dysfunctional House Fails to Pass Temporary Homeland Security Funding", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/27/Dysfunctional-House-Fails-Pass-Temporary-Homeland-Security-Funding", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/10312013_Puck_Gridlock_Partisan.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/27/Dysfunctional-House-Fails-Pass-Temporary-Homeland-Security-Funding", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/10312013_Puck_Gridlock_Partisan.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The House failed to pass a 20-day stopgap bill to fund the Department of Homeland Secu", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfc2e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt either gets bit tonight ... or it gets bit in three weeks.\u201dRelated: Factbox\u2014What Happens If Homeland Security Funding Lapses?\nThe House passed a bill weeks ago that would fund DHS for the same period and would undo Obama\u2019s directives.\nSpeaking on the House floor after the vote, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told members they should stand by for possible additional votes later Friday or during the weekend.\nThe House failed to pass a 20-day stopgap bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security Friday, hurtling the agency toward a midnight shutdown deadline with no clear resolution in sight.\nThe Senate passed its own bill Friday morning that would fund DHS through September and would not touch Obama\u2019s immigration directives."}
