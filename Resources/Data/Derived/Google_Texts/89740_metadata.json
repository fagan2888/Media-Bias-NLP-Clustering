He said that having fewer insurers results in higher premiums for consumers. The Commonwealth Fund is a private foundation that, among other things, supports the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\n\n\nStates Have \u2018Robust Powers.\u2019\n\nState insurance regulators have \u201crobust powers\u201d to examine the mergers, Balto said at the NAIC's health insurance committee meeting. Under state laws, insurance regulators have broader powers to conduct their own independent, public investigations of the mergers than the Department of Justice's mandate of looking at whether mergers will substantially lessen competition, he said.\n\nState regulators have a mandate to look at whether the mergers would hurt the public interest, Balto said. DOJ officials have less expertise than state regulators do concerning local health insurance markets, and the DOJ's process is not as transparent as state processes, which include public hearings and records, he said.\n\nState regulators also have more remedies they can use to mitigate any anticompetitive effects, Balto said. He suggested that the NAIC health insurance committee form a task force or working group to investigate the proposed mergers, noting that state attorneys general often merge their efforts to investigate mergers.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia\n\nBut California's insurance commissioner, Dave Jones, told Bloomberg BNA Nov. 25 that Balto's proposal to set up a joint NAIC group to examine the mergers wouldn't be workable because \u201cthe regulatory authority resides in each state as a result of state statute. Each state that chooses to will be holding hearings, in particular the state insurance commissioners in whose states the insurance companies are domiciled.\u201d\n\nA joint state working group \u201cwouldn't have the requisite authority to do what I believe Mr. Balto was advocating for\u201d in closely examining the proposed mergers, he said.\n\nIn California, the Department of Insurance will hold hearings on each of the proposed mergers, looking at their impact on consumer choice, price, competition and on medical providers, among other things, Jones said.\n\n\n\n\n\nKentucky's Process\n\nKentucky Insurance Commissioner Sharon Clark told Bloomberg BNA Nov. 24 that Kentucky, where Humana has a 13,000-employee office, will conduct a public hearing similar to hearings that will be held in other states and territories that would be affected by the mergers.\n\nThe state has information on provider networks, and part of the process will be to determine if the merged entities would have sufficient family practitioners and specialists, Clark said. \u201cIt gets fairly granular,\u201d she said.\n\nState officials are closer to their residents than federal officials are, Clark said. \u201cWe just know our marketplace,\u201d she said.\n\nClark also said she is having an extra analysis conducted to determine what impact the mergers would have on the Kentucky's state-operated Affordable Care Act marketplace. \u201cSo I think I'm doing a pretty thorough review down here,\u201d she said.\n\nRepresentatives of insurance commissioners in Connecticut, where Aetna and Cigna are headquartered; Wisconsin, where Humana has offices; and Indiana, where Anthem is headquartered, also said they are collecting information from the companies to prepare for public hearings, which will be held in 2016.\n\nAnthem spokesman Leslie Porras told Bloomberg BNA in an e-mail Nov. 25 that, \u201cIn addition to the federal regulatory review, Anthem is also moving forward in the process of obtaining regulatory review in 26 states. We are committed to engaging in constructive and transparent dialogue as both the federal and state processes move forward, and will continue to work cooperatively with all relevant policymakers and regulatory entities to complete this transaction. We anticipate the transaction will close in the second half of 2016.\u201d\n\nAetna spokesman Matthew Clyburn told Bloomberg BNA in an e-mail Nov. 25, \u201cWe believe the combination of Aetna and Humana will improve the health care system and offer consumers more choices and greater access to higher quality, more affordable care. Our proposed transaction is primarily about the Medicare marketplace, where there is robust competition and choice. We are confident that our transaction will receive a fair, thorough and fact-based review from the Department of Justice and the states.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal Market Conditions Important\n\nState reviews are crucial because \u201cthe local market conditions really influence how likely it is that a merged insurer could get concessions from providers,\u201d Schneider said.\n\nThe trend in recent years has been toward provider consolidation, said Schneider, who authored a blog posting released Nov. 20 on provider mergers. When hospitals merge, there is \u201cgood evidence\u201d that the mergers result in higher prices but not necessarily better quality, he said. Further, \u201cthose provider prices get passed along as higher premiums.\u201d\n\nIn markets where insurers are more consolidated than providers, insurers are often able to get lower prices from providers, Schneider said. However, insurers \u201cdon't pass those savings along to consumers,\u201d he said. The Commonwealth Fund released another study Nov. 20, which found that consolidation in the private health insurance industry leads to premium increases, even though insurers with larger local market shares generally obtain lower prices from health care providers.\n\nThe American Medical Association issued a study in September concluding that the combined impact of the mergers would exceed federal antitrust guidelines in as many as 97 metropolitan areas in 17 states . Also in September, American Hospital Association President and Chief Executive Officer Rick Pollack said before the Senate Judiciary Committee that the mergers could make health insurance more expensive and less accessible for consumers.\n\n\n\n\n\nState Reviews Attractive For Opponents\n\nThomas Greaney, a professor at Saint Louis University School of Law, told Bloomberg BNA Nov. 24 that \u201cthe attractiveness to those who oppose the mergers\u201d in suggesting that state regulators take an active role is that state officials could apply broader standards to look at whether the mergers may stop potentially lost competition. That standard is harder for federal officials to meet in blocking mergers or winning concessions, he said.\n\n\u201cIf you've got an extra arrow in your quiver it might make it more likely the parties would abandon the merger if they're likely to face expensive challenges before state insurance commissioners even if they settle with the Justice Department,\u201d Greaney said.\n\nThe DOJ should get input from the insurance commissioners in connection with any divestitures, Greaney said. Requiring a health insurer to divest plans is \u201cnot like selling a cement factory,\u201d he said. \u201cYou really have to buy the network or at least get access to the same network at the same discounted prices.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nProblems with Medicare Advantage Market\n\nGreaney said the \u201cmost problematic\u201d merger is the Aetna-Humana merger, because both companies have a substantial presence in the Medicare Advantage market.\n\nPaul Ginsburg, director of public policy at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics, agreed that merger opponents are pushing for state reviews for tactical reasons. \u201cGiven that the Justice Department appears to be reviewing the Aetna-Humana and Anthem-Cigna mergers quite seriously and thoroughly, all of the advocacy for state reviews is surprising,\u201d he told Bloomberg BNA in an email Nov. 24. \u201cIt strikes me that some opponents of these mergers are searching for additional venues to fight them.\u201d\n\nIn these particular mergers, Ginsburg said, \u201csome of the issues seem intrinsically national.\u201d The segment causing the greatest concern in the Anthem-Cigna merger is the self-insured market for large national employers, he said.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Sara Hansard in Washington at shansard@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Brian Broderick at bbroderick@bna.com\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/critics-health-insurer-n57982064050/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "Critics of the planned mergers of four large health insurers into two companies want state regulators to vigorously investigate the impact of the consolidations.", "title": "Critics of Health Insurer Mergers Urge States to Act"}, "csrf-token": "BXldhRIRpUp0JykZaXCm_2BJuVXpNyO7wpqJH28lkMCY_zmzJp-enrhg8kXbz82IcObldeFK9eT5PB7q8r2vg9ia75BbFSyZhxs4odJIipo1:anmlNN_HJKk3yuR1RxwkwHzkfp5293Pc-w5XYTn5AayuYKdJJZw_weKQwAEOG4Vn2R4GOjqyCxFMlPG1VlzRCLNaUa707_GycvZCXN7Hwos1", "description": "Critics of the planned mergers of four large health insurers into two companies want state regulators to vigorously investigate the impact of the consolidations", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fragment": "!"}, "article_summary": "States Have \u2018Robust Powers.\u2019State insurance regulators have \u201crobust powers\u201d to examine the mergers, Balto said at the NAIC's health insurance committee meeting.\nState regulators have a mandate to look at whether the mergers would hurt the public interest, Balto said.\nNov. 27 \u2014 Critics of the planned mergers of four large health insurers into two companies want state regulators to vigorously investigate the impact of the consolidations.\nState regulators also have more remedies they can use to mitigate any anticompetitive effects, Balto said.\nHe suggested that the NAIC health insurance committee form a task force or working group to investigate the proposed mergers, noting that state attorneys general often merge their efforts to investigate mergers."}
