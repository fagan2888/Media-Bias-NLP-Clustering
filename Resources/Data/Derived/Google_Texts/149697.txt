“Our digital strategy is to create innovative, fun, and engaging content that conservatives will want to share,” NRCC press secretary Andrew Clark told Red Alert Politics in an email. “The NRCC store, with products like our ‘All I Want For Christmas Is To Be Rid of ObamaCare t-shirts,’ is another chapter in that strategy. We’re continuing to prove that we can compete with, and beat, Democrats on all parts of the digital field.”
