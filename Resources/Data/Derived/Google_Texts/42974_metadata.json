Kentucky is seeing a shortage of physicians.\n\nMercy Primary Care Doctor Christopher Sperry has a wait list and knows his colleagues struggle as well fitting everyone in.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest things I hate to hear is when patients can't get back in to see me in a timely manner,\u201d Sperry said.\n\nThere's a demand for more doctors. Sperry says the Affordable Care Act is a partial reason for the demand, because there are more patients with insurance, but the number of providers hasn\u2019t increased.\n\n\u201cI do think we feel that shortage every day. I think we do struggle with that because we want to do everything we can to take care of our patients,\u201d Sperry said.\n\nHe says another reason may be fewer students choosing to go to medical school.\n\n\u201cOur best and brightest can find another career that is somewhat easier. They don't have to devote their lives to education, and then the cost of just going through that,\u201d Sperry said.\n\nHe says the average medical student can come out with $180,000 to $300,000 in debt.\n\nAn association that represents medical schools and teaching hospitals finds there could be a shortage nationwide creating a need for 90,000 more doctors by 2025.\n\nThat number includes specialties, but Sperry says not many doctors pick primary care over specializing, like his medical school class.\n\n\"There was probably about less than 10 percent of us that went into primary care,\u201d Sperry said.\n\nHe says our area is about 30 primary care providers short of what it needs, and he hopes new medical programs like the University of Kentucky\u2019s Medical School expansion will help.\n\n\u201cHopefully, get more rural students, and in these rural areas, that will hopefully go back into primary care,\u201d Sperry said.\n\nThe University of Kentucky is developing a four year satellite program in Bowling Green and expanding its rural physician leadership program in Morehead. UK's medical school in Lexington is at capacity and can't increase enrollment without the help of other institutions. There are 521 students enrolled in UK's college of medicine, and the partnership will allow that number to increase by about 30 percent.\n\nMercy Medical Associates, Lourdes employed physician practice, added 33 providers \u2014that includes physicians and mid-levels \u2014 last year and are always actively recruiting.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "When you schedule a check-up, it can now take weeks or months to see your doctor.
