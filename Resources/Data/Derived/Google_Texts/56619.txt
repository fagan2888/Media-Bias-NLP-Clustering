KABUL, Afghanistan — Officials say a Taliban attack on a joint NATO-Afghan base in eastern Afghanistan has killed one NATO soldier.

Spokesman Ahmad Zia Abdulzai in Nangarhar province says the attack took place on Saturday morning when a suicide bomber struck outside the base in the province’s Ghani Khail district.

After that, five Taliban fighters on foot tried to storm the base. Abdulzai says Afghan and NATO troops returned fire, killing the attackers.

NATO said a service member had died following a suicide bombing in eastern Afghanistan. The alliance did not identify the soldier’s nationality.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the attack in an email to the media.

Afghan insurgents have intensified attacks recently in a campaign to regain territory as foreign forces prepare to leave at the end of 2014.
