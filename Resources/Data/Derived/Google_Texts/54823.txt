Crews are responding to the scene of a grass fire near the unfinished Native American Cultural Center and Museum.

Firefighters were called out to battle the blaze, just to the southeast of the Cultural Center, in the 600 block of 600 American Indian Blvd. The fire may have been caused by a passing train.

The fire started out relatively small, but muddy terrain in the area and a shift in wind direction made fighting the fire more difficult for firefighters. It is not a threat to damage the museum.
