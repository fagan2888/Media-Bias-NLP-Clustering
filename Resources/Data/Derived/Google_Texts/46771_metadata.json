An example of this came when a panel of strategists on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cUp\u201d called Carson a \u201csafe negro\u201d Sunday while explaining his appeal to white Republican voters.\n\nWhen host Richard Liu asked Republican strategist E. O\u2019Brien Murray what about Carson appealed to Republican primary voters, Murray replied by saying he thought people appreciated the retired neurosurgeon\u2019s attacks on President Barack Obama, the nation's first black president. He specifically referred to Carson\u2019s speech at the National Prayer Breakfast in 2013 in which he harshly criticized the president.\n\n\u201cIt was his attack of Obama, and frankly a black man attacking a black president, which is something people get away [with]...When you talk about it years ago, remember he stood in front of the president and he made his bona fides originally attacking the president face to face, at a prayer breakfast, mind you,\u201d Murray said.\n\nPhoto: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nDemocratic strategist and social justice advocate L. Joy Williams jumped in with a similar comment, explaining how she sees Republicans react to Carson.\n\n\u201cThe really important thing of people supporting him because it\u2019s, oh, there\u2019s another black man commenting or -- negatively against the president, and I don\u2019t feel comfortable in doing so because of the race factor,\u201d Williams said. \u201cSo here\u2019s someone who can do it that\u2019s kind of --\u201d\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nMurray then interrupted Williams to contest the idea that he and other Republicans are uncomfortable criticizing Carson because of the candidate\u2019s race.\n\n\u201cNot at all. The question was what was he doing,\u201d Murray said. \u201cHe was attacking the president, and he was going after him in such a way that was very well pointed out, where the issues were with the president with Obamacare and other things. Given his narrative and history and his bio, which is fantastic\u2026\u201d\n\nWilliams responded again. \u201cWhich is one in terms of having the, I was going to say, having the 'safe negro' comment on someone that you\u2019re against,\u201d she said.\n\nThe topic of Republicans not knowing how to deal with Carson\u2019s race has come up several times in the campaign so far. When Carson moved ahead of Trump in Iowa polls a few weeks ago, Trump began trying to attack the neurosurgeon during his campaign events. But at one event Oct. 23, The Daily Banter reported that the New York businessman assured his audience it was alright for him to criticize Carson because Trump\u2019s black friend told him so.\n\n\u201cBen Carson is the one that\u2019s leading Iowa, supposedly, okay. And I said, \u2018I gotta talk about him.\u2019 A friend of mine who happens to be a great, great athlete, he happens to be African-American. He calls himself black, he said \u2018I\u2019m black!\u2019 \u201cI said, \u2018I can\u2019t say that, it\u2019s not politically correct,\u2019 it\u2019s true. He said, \u2018You are the greatest trash-talker that has ever lived,\u2019 and I never thought\u2026 He says this to me! And he said, \u2018I never thought I\u2019d say it about a white guy!\u2019 \u201cCan you believe this? And I said, \u2018I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true or not,\u2019 because I refused to acknowledge\u2026He said \u2018When you said low energy for Bush, you defined him so incredibly, it was over. He can have $125 million in the bank, Donald, it\u2019s over. It was just defined!\u2019 \u201cBut I said, but Ben Carson is super-low-energy, right? It\u2019s super. He\u2019s super low. Super low energy. We need tremendous energy!\u201d\n\nCarson is known for making colorful, often controversial comments that seem to excite voters and have kept him in the news for weeks. However, after his surge in Iowa polling and a national CBS/New York Times poll late last month, more recent polls have Trump back at the top of the GOP field. Still, the two remain in close competition at the front of the race, and their attention is unlikely to wane any time soon.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ben carson, donald trump, race, black candidate, black americans, president barack obama, republican party, republican presidential candidate, republican primary voters, neurosurgeon, front-runner, controversy, democrats, politically correct, criticisms", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "Republican and Democratic strategists agreed on MSNBC Sunday that Ben Carson allows the GOP to attack President Barack Obama because he is also a black man.", "title": "Ben Carson Is 'Safe Negro' Who Can Criticize Obama, MSNBC Republican And Democratic Strategists Claim", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/ben-carson-safe-negro-who-can-criticize-obama-msnbc-republican-democratic-strategists-2165537", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/11/02/carson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republican and Democratic strategists agreed on MSNBC Sunday that Ben Carson allows the GOP to attack President Barack Obama because he is also a black man.", "title": "Ben Carson Is 'Safe Negro' Who Can Criticize Obama, MSNBC Republican And Democratic Strategists Claim", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/ben-carson-safe-negro-who-can-criticize-obama-msnbc-republican-democratic-strategists-2165537", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/11/02/carson.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/11/02/carson.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "National", "published_time": "2015-11-02T14:36:22-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-07T00:32:16-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Republican and Democratic strategists agreed on MSNBC Sunday that Ben Carson allows the GOP to attack President Barack Obama because he is also a black man."}, "article_summary": "An example of this came when a panel of strategists on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cUp\u201d called Carson a \u201csafe negro\u201d Sunday while explaining his appeal to white Republican voters.\nWhen Carson moved ahead of Trump in Iowa polls a few weeks ago, Trump began trying to attack the neurosurgeon during his campaign events.\nHe specifically referred to Carson\u2019s speech at the National Prayer Breakfast in 2013 in which he harshly criticized the president.\nWhen host Richard Liu asked Republican strategist E.
