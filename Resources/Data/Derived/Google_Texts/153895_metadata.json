But she nixed that name in favor of something more regal, opting instead for a nod to socialite Wallis Simpson, who got England\u2019s King Edward VIII to abdicate the throne in 1936 so he could marry her. \u201cThey never had children, but they had pugs,\u201d Cohen explained.\n\nAsked if little Wallis will be dressing in typical Washington style, Cohen replied, \u201cI vowed when I first got her that she wasn\u2019t going to be all dolled up \u2014 then that all went out the window. I\u2019m very tacky. I believe the bigger, the flashier, the better.\u201d She added, \u201cI would describe her current look, and this might be considered abuse by some, but she\u2019s sort of like a \u2018Real Housewife of New Jersey.\u2019 Everything she has is pink and leopard and sequin.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Public relations queen Courtney Cohen is welcoming a new (adorable) family member ... her puggle named Wallis.The happy union was nearly a year-and-a-half in the making.
