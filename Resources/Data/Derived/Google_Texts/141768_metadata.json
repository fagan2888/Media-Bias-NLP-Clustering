REDERIC J. BROWN/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWith exactly one year to go before America chooses its 45th president, voters left, right and center say they crave \u201cauthenticity\u201d in their candidates.\n\nAnd though Americans disagree on exactly what the word means in a political context, nobody can deny that the notion of authenticity is having an unprecedented impact on the 2016 race for the White House.\n\nFueled by anger at government, partisanship, big money in politics, the hunger for the \u201creal deal\u201d is driving the polls like never before.\n\nRepublican Ben Carson, a soft-spoken neurosurgeon who has never held public office but gets high marks from his supporters for his genuineness, is leading Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton \u2014 a former secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady who has been dinged for seeming cloistered, evasive and inauthentic \u2014 by 10 percentage points, a Quinnipiac University poll found this past week.\n\nBernie Sanders, Clinton\u2019s Democratic rival, has drawn surprisingly big poll numbers, record crowds and millions in contributions with his unabashed democratic socialist populism. And Carson has only now caught up to Republican rival Donald Trump, the \u201cauthentic\u201d billionaire who dominated the polls all summer despite often-outrageous, headline-grabbing statements.\n\nSo what makes a candidate the genuine article?\n\nIs it a barrage of confident bluntness or taking and explaining clear positions on issues? A record of accomplishment in office, or \u201coutsider\u201d status and a vow to shake up the status quo? \u201cTelling it like it is,\u201d or smoothly telling people what they want to hear?\n\nWhen Sanders, a self-declared democratic socialist with 35 years in public office, and Trump \u2014 who moonlighted as a reality TV star \u2014 both lay claim to the mantle from opposite ends of the political spectrum, it seems authenticity is in the eyes of the beholder. But the common thread might be saying what you mean without apparent handling or scripting and seeming not to care about the consequences.\n\n\u201cYou know it when you see it, and you\u2019ve either got it or you don\u2019t,\u201d said Garry South, a veteran Democratic campaign consultant who has worked with former Gov. Gray Davis, former Controller Steve Westly and 2000 presidential candidate Al Gore. South knows better than most that candidates seen as inauthentic are those who \u201ccome off as being stiff and not very comfortable in their own skins \u2014 and voters can smell it, they can see it, they can hear it.\u201d\n\nFor example, South said Democratic presidential candidate Martin O\u2019Malley came off as professional and articulate last month at the first Democratic debate, yet he sounded \u201clike one of the audio-animatronic robots at Disneyland \u2014 programmed and stilted.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Republican candidate Chris Christie has just gone viral with video of a town-hall meeting last month in Belmont, New Hampshire, at which he spoke about confronting addiction as a disease by discussing his mother\u2019s struggle with cigarettes and a friend\u2019s fatal descent into prescription drug abuse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat just came off as one of the most authentic moments that I\u2019ve ever seen in my lifetime in politics,\u201d South said, adding that some might see Christie as an overbearing bully, \u201cbut I think he\u2019s authentic; he is what he seems to be.\u201d\n\nBlunt authenticity is what drew Dawn Garibay, 41, of Antioch, to Trump, and turned her off to most of the other candidates.\n\n\u201cSometimes I feel candidates don\u2019t say what they feel because other people might take it out of context, or it\u2019s not really what people want to hear,\u201d said Garibay, a mother of three who works as a care provider for the elderly and disabled. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t say how you truly feel, nobody is ever going to know.\u201d\n\nFor Vincent Casalaina, 69, of Berkeley, authenticity means the consistency he sees in Sanders\u2019 policy stances.\n\n\u201cWhat sets him apart most in my mind is his ability to maintain a position over time, If you go back and look at the things he was fighting for in the late \u201860s and early \u201870s, they\u2019re pretty much the things he\u2019s fighting for now,\u201d said Casalaina, a retired videographer. \u201cThose are issues that are core to his being, and it doesn\u2019t matter whether they\u2019re in vogue or out of vogue.\u201d\n\nSince Friday, Carson has been in damage-control mode as he fends off a Politico report that he never was offered a \u201cfull scholarship\u201d to West Point, as he claimed in his new book. But Carol Agaliotis, 80, of Morgan Hill, said she \u201cfell in love\u201d with him in 2013 when he spoke out against Obamacare at the National Prayer Breakfast, which President Barack Obama attended. \u201cHe confronted Obama when I thought it was very daring to do so -- I didn\u2019t think anyone would have the cojones to do what he did.\n\n\u201cBen Carson does say what he means and means what he says,\u201d added Agaliotis, a retired foster care home operator for ailing infants, even if he lacks the policy chops of a more experienced politician. \u201cHe\u2019s a brilliant man, and he would be able to get people around him who could coach him in the right direction.\u201d\n\nThe polls show what authenticity is worth. Clinton\u2019s poll numbers have spiked upward again since her relaxed, personable showing at the first Democratic debate and her calm, cool and collected testimony at House Republicans\u2019 marathon hearing on the 2012 deaths of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, is hailed as a paragon of \u201ctelling it like it is\u201d even though his positions on drug legalization, abortion, taxes, gun control, health care, Social Security and Hillary Clinton have all changed dramatically in the past 15 years.\n\nFellow billionaire businessman Mark Cuban might have summed up Trump\u2019s appeal best:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what his actual positions are,\u201d Cuban wrote in July. \u201cI don\u2019t care if he says the wrong thing. He says what\u2019s on his mind. He gives honest answers rather than prepared answers. This is more important than anything any candidate has done in years.\u201d\n\nTrump couldn\u2019t have gotten away with this in past presidential elections, South said, but \u201cthis is a year where moving outside the box and breaking the mold is being rewarded.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis year is sort of a breaking point for a lot of people,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of it is disappointment in Obama. A lot of it is disgust with the hyperpartisan maneuvering in Washington. And it\u2019s being driven also by the negativity of the super PACs.\u201d\n\nRepublican candidate Jeb Bush\u2019s stiffly delivered attack on rival Marco Rubio\u2019s Senate attendance record at the last GOP debate \u2014 and being caught flat-footed by Rubio\u2019s smooth, forceful counterpunch\u2014- underscored how vital firm, eloquent speech is to establishing authenticity, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Annenberg Public Policy Center.\n\nVoters want someone who can create \u201ca sense of spontaneous interaction with an audience, or at least ... of a deeply held conviction being voiced in real time,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not hearing from advisers. You\u2019re not hearing from pollsters. You\u2019re hearing from that individual with all the flaws that individual has on clear display.\u201d\n\nIt could be argued that voters have always wanted this, said J. Ann Selzer, a political pollster based in Des Moines, Iowa. The desire for authenticity was certainly there in 2012, when \u201cyou had one candidate up for one week and another candidate up another week,\u201d she said, as people like Herman Cain, Michele Bachmann and Rick Santorum each had a moment in the sun.\n\nBut eventually the \u201cwe want something else\u201d rallying cry was replaced by \u201clet\u2019s get it done,\u201d Selzer said, and GOP voters rolled round to establishment favorite Mitt Romney.\n\nNobody knows whether that will happen again this year. But consider that Cain and Santorum topped the polls for only about two weeks each in the months before Romney clinched the 2012 nomination. Trump has now been leading the GOP polls for almost four months. And Carson has been in second place and climbing for three months. So something seems to have changed.\n\nThis year \u201cit\u2019s mattering more perhaps because there are more people fighting for that space\u201d on the GOP ticket, Selzer said. \u201cPeople are more sensitive this time around to the sense that candidates are going to say one thing and do another \u2014 they\u2019re done with that.\u201d\n\nAnd so even a candidate who lacks a firm grip on policy is OK with many voters who simply want anything but business as usual, Selzer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing if a candidate doesn\u2019t know how it works, because hopefully they\u2019ll make it work some other way.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "With exactly one year to go before America chooses its 45th president, voters left, right and center say they crave \u201cauthenticity\u201d in their candidates.And though Americans disagree on exactly what the word means in a political con", "title": "\u2018Authenticity\u2019 emerges as major theme in presidential election", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20151107/authenticity-emerges-as-major-theme-in-presidential-election", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20151107/NEWS/151109581/AR/0/AR-151109581.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1031px"}, "type": "article", "title": "\u2018Authenticity\u2019 emerges as major theme in presidential election"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailynews.com", "description": "With exactly one year to go before America chooses its 45th president, voters left, right and center say they crave \u201cauthenticity\u201d in their candidates.And though Americans disagree on exactly what the word means in a political con", "title": "\u2018Authenticity\u2019 emerges as major theme in presidential election", "url": "http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20151107/authenticity-emerges-as-major-theme-in-presidential-election", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20151107/NEWS/151109581/AR/0/AR-151109581.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@ladailynews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Ben Carson,Bernie Sanders,Election 2016,Hillary Clinton,presidential candidate, Presidential elections", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ben Carson,Bernie Sanders,Election 2016,Hillary Clinton,presidential candidate, Presidential elections"}, "article_summary": "Presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton (R) gestures while standing beside Bernie Sanders during a photo spray of the candidates during the first Democratic presidential debate in Las Vegas, Nevada on October 13.\nGray Davis, former Controller Steve Westly and 2000 presidential candidate Al Gore.\nFellow billionaire businessman Mark Cuban might have summed up Trump\u2019s appeal best:\u201cI don\u2019t care what his actual positions are,\u201d Cuban wrote in July.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if he says the wrong thing.\n\u201cBut if you don\u2019t say how you truly feel, nobody is ever going to know.\u201dFor Vincent Casalaina, 69, of Berkeley, authenticity means the consistency he sees in Sanders\u2019 policy stances."}
