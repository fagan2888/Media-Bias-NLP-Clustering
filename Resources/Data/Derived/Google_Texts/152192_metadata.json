Richard J. Durbin, Illinois Democrat, said Sunday that members of his party have not drawn a line in the sand on an extension of unemployment benefits getting included in a possible budget deal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve reached that point where we\u2019ve said this is it; take it or leave it,\u201d Mr. Durbin said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cWhat I hear from [Sen.] Patty Murray \u2014 I spoke to her the other night \u2014 negotiations are making progress, moving in the right direction. They haven\u2019t closed the deal, but I certainly hope, as part of it, that the negotiators will take to heart what the president had to say.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama, in his weekly address, called on Congress to extend unemployment benefits that are set to expire this month. If Congress doesn\u2019t act before lawmakers leave on their holiday break, about 1.3 million unemployed Americans will see their benefits run out. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated it would cost taxpayers about $26 billion to extend the benefits through next year.\n\nSEE ALSO: Obama: Hole U.S. \u2018digging out of\u2019 requires billions more in unemployment benefits\n\nSen. Rob Portman, Ohio Republican, said he was hopeful that a deal could be reached by the end of this week but that the thought was the benefits would be handled separately.\n\n\u201cBut look, the key is that we not have another government shutdown, that we do keep the spending caps in place, that we don\u2019t raise taxes at a time when the economy is still weak,\u201d Mr. Portman said. \u201cAnd I think we can accomplish that over the next couple days.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
