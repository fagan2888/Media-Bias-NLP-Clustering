The fire has scorched nearly 325 square miles in both states, the majority of the devastation in south-central Kansas.\n\nThe Barber County Sheriff's Office said Saturday morning crews contained the perimeter, giving patrols the opportunity to look for hot spots and protect structures. However, estimates still put the fire at about 15 percent contained in Barber County and 100 percent contained in Comanche County.\n\nDuring the Kansas Adjutant General's visit to Barber County on Friday, it was announced he will be ordering National Guard helicopters to assist with firefighting efforts. Four Black Hawk helicopters arrived in Medicine Lodge Saturday morning.\n\nBlack hawks in medicine lodge Posted by KAKE-TV on Saturday, March 26, 2016\n\nOfficials continue to monitor the overall damage in the county and are trying to determine if the damage estimates meet or exceed the threshold necessary to qualify for a FEMA Disaster Declaration that would provide public assistance for damaged public infrastructure.\n\nAny donations should be directed through United Way's 211 system.\n\nBarber County officials are expressing their thanks to those who have taken the time out of their own lives and from their families to assist in the Anderson Creek Fire incident.\n\n\u201cIt is very humbling to see the outpouring of donations, resources, and individual\u2019s time coming into this community,\u201d said Gaten Wood, Barber County Attorney. \u201cYour help is really appreciated!\u201d", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Crews contained the perimeter, giving patrols the opportunity to look for hot spots and protect structures.", "language": "english", "author": "KAKE News", "og": {"description": "Crews contained the perimeter, giving patrols the opportunity to look for hot spots and protect structures.", "title": "Crews keep Kansas wildfire from spreading overnight", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Crews-keep-Kansas-wildfire-from-spreading-overnight-373625751.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/F4E/D79/F4ED79043A0745E7B980F9C5901CBBDF", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/321/CE6/321CE6078587460A9ED30FC771DFDBB8.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Crews contained the perimeter, giving patrols the opportunity to look for hot spots and protect structures.", "title": "Crews keep Kansas wildfire from spreading overnight", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Crews-keep-Kansas-wildfire-from-spreading-overnight-373625751.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/barber+wildfire.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Crews keep Kansas wildfire from spreading overnight", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Crews keep Kansas wildfire from"}, "article_summary": "More Video...
