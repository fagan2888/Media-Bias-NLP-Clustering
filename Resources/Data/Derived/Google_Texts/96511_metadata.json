Diane Black (R., Tenn.) has been fighting for more than a year to eliminate a wasteful and abusive office within the Department of Homeland Security that the Obama administration continues despite it being defunded by Congress.\n\nBlack put a halt to Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s (ICE) \u201cpublic advocate,\u201d a lobbying agent for illegal immigrants awaiting deportation. Her amendment to end the program was signed into law by President Barack Obama in March 2013.\n\nBlack discovered that the program was still there five months later under a different name.\n\n\u201cIt really flew in the face of \u2018Gee whiz, I\u2019m an imperial president and I can do whatever I want to do,\u2019\u201d Black said in an interview with the Washington Free Beacon. \u201cWhen you sign something into law, as the president he is sworn to uphold the law. And to skirt what Congress did really bothered me.\u201d\n\nThe position, which was given to ICE Senior Adviser Andrew Lorenzen-Strait, serves as a \u201cpoint of contact for individuals, including those in immigration proceedings, non-governmental organizations and other community and advocacy groups.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want the public to know that they have a representative at this agency whose sole duty is to ensure their voice is heard and their interests are recognized,\u201d said then-ICE Director John Morton on Feb. 7, 2012.\n\nBlack says the role is counterproductive to ICE\u2019s mission, which is to enforce immigration laws.\n\n\u201cIn many cases this was really the opposite of what we want our ICE officials to be doing,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is, for people who are here illegally\u2014and most of these folks had committed a crime\u2014that they were impeding the process that is put in place by our immigration enforcement officers.\u201d\n\nNearly a year after she first introduced an amendment to defund the position, Black was able to secure its passage in a continuing resolution, which was signed into law on March 26, 2013.\n\nSection 567 of the appropriations act stated, \u201cNone of the funds made available in this Act may be used to provide funding for the position of Public Advocate within U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\u201d The \u201cpublic advocate\u201d would be eliminated for at least a year.\n\nHowever, in August 2013, the government accountability group Judicial Watch exposed that the administration had simply rebranded the job. Lorenzen-Strait was now the \u201cDeputy Assistant Director Custody Programs and Community Outreach.\u201d\n\nThe title has nearly identical duties. \u201cIt was very, very similar,\u201d Black said. \u201cAlmost to a T.\u201d\n\nThe new community outreach position provides a hotline for illegal immigrants facing removal proceedings using the same telephone number as the former public advocate office.\n\nSince the discovery, Black has pressed ICE for answers, but says she has been \u201cstonewalled.\u201d\n\nThe agency has delayed releasing documents related to the position, forcing Black\u2019s office to file a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. Her office was able to confirm that Lorenzen-Strait holds a level 15 civil service position, which has a salary range between $99,628 to $129,517.\n\nMeanwhile, Black is pushing H.R. 3732, the Immigration Compliance Enforcement Act, a standalone bill to permanently end the public advocate. The legislation would prevent the creation of any position within ICE that has the same or similar duties of \u201ccommunity outreach.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a permanent law that would make sure that this wouldn\u2019t pop its head back up in another name,\u201d she said. Black is hopeful her bill, which currently has 57 cosponsors, will receive a vote. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R., Va.) has indicated there is a path forward for the bill, she said.\n\nBlack said her bill is one way for Congress to push back against the \u201cimperial presidency.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe administration is not respecting the law,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not only in this instance, it\u2019s Obamacare, delay this, or stop that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s his own bill,\u201d Black said. \u201cI mean this is his own idea that was enacted by law, and then to just say, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t even have to abide by that?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe big perspective of that is that he\u2019s been very blatant about, \u2018I don\u2019t have to abide by the law, I have a phone\u2019 and he has a pen, and he said he can do what he wants to do,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what our Constitution says, and it\u2019s really, really dangerous where we have a president who is an imperial president and we have gone straight around what our constitution intended, and that was three branches and all of them being equal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a precedent that is being set, not just in his administration but in future administrations can say, \u2018Well, if President Obama did it, I can do it as well.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
