Like many residents across our north shore parishes, two Folsom residents, Ken Wilt and Gene Grabbe, choose to spend part of the new year serving others.



Over the next three months, both men will be volunteering at the AARP Tax-Aide site in Franklinton from February through mid-April to help senior citizens and others prepare their annual federal and state tax returns. Grabbe will also volunteer weekly at the Covington site.



There are six AARP Tax-Aide sites across our three parish area and residents are encouraged to take advantage of this free service, which not only helps individuals properly prepare their tax returns but will also file the returns electronically.



Residents in St. Tammany, Tangipahoa and Washington parishes are encouraged to utilize the free service offered in Covington, Mandeville, Slidell, Franklinton, Hammond and Ponchatoula. The day and time is different at each location and only two of the six sites offer appointments.



For instance, while the Covington, Hammond, Ponchatoula and Slidell sites work on a first-come, first-served basis, both the Franklinton and Mandeville sites take appointments.



According to Bush resident and Tax-Aide Technical Coordinator Bill McHugh, the program is offered through the AARP Foundation, the charitable arm of AARP that provides services aimed primarily at senior citizens.



"The typical profile of our customers is 55 years of age or older," McHugh said. "While many of our customers are retired, a lot are still working but may have retirement income."



McHugh said many who take advantage of this free tax return preparation program are retirees who are still working in their career, may have started a new career, are working part time or may be self-employed. "To that end some of the returns we handle include retirement income, investment income, wages and self-employment Schedule C, all of which we can handle without issue," McHugh said.



One challenge taxpayers might encounter this year is dealing with the Affordable Care Act, which will be a part of the 2014 tax returns.



"With a few exceptions, everyone has to have health coverage or they will have tax penalties to handle," he said. "There are also new issues with supplemental payments from buying insurance through the Health Insurance Marketplace and those payments will be reconciled on the tax return."



Since all of the volunteers with this program have recently completed their annual training, McHugh is confident everyone at each of the six sites will be able to reconcile these new issues.



"There will be tax consequences, and we will be dealing with it," he said, "but it will not be an issue for our seniors who are on Medicare, since Medicare meets the Affordable Care Act requirements."



McHugh says that the sites will be very busy the first few weeks they are open and suggests that taxpayers wait until March to come in, unless they have an urgent tax issue. Wilt agrees that they will be busy right off the bat and that this year's return will be more complicated some people.



"We go through extensive training every year," he said. "Each year there are new rules we have to learn and as Bill (McHugh) said the Affordable Care Act is going to add complications."



"We had extra training for that, and we can only work at the sites if we pass the test and become certified," he said. "Plus, there are standards of conduct we must follow, and we are tested on those as well."



Since the tax returns get more complicated over time, Wilt and others feel this free service is a great way to help the community. "People thank us profusely, and that is the pleasure I get out of doing this," Wilt said. "We are only open once a week at the Franklinton site, but I expect we will do several hundred returns this year."



Gene Grabbe, who volunteers at both the Franklinton and Covington sites, decided to become an AARP/Tax-Aide volunteer when he realized many people at his church were paying tax preparers substantial fees for simple returns.



"I knew them well enough to realize I could help them; if I could do my own taxes I knew I could do others too," Grabbe said. "Plus, as a member of AARP, I learned that the Tax-Aide program needed volunteers."



"I signed up for the training and certification and now I've been doing this for 13 years," he said.



According to Grabbe the best thing about this program is that you get to provide a free service that is beneficial to the community. "Sometimes what people do with their income and return is counterproductive, and with the training we receive we can see in what areas they can maximize their deductions and put their finances in better order," Grabbe said.



"We're not financial experts, but sometimes we see situations where they can take certain deductions in their situation," he said. "Plus, we utilize the computer software provided by AARP Tax-Aide, and it does most of the work."



Since the volunteers are able to file the completed returns electronically, participants can expect to get their returns quickly.



"It makes me feel good to do this," Grabbe said. "It is good to help your community. Plus, the tax code is written by lawyers and government personnel, so it is not necessarily easy for the average person to know all of the exceptions and advantages to maximize their return. With our training and certification, we are better prepared to help them, and it helps build community spirit."



According to McHugh, last year the volunteers at the six sites completed 1,500 returns with 97 percent of them being filed electronically. "The seniors are our target audience, and our primary goal is to serve older taxpayers with a low to moderate income," McHugh said. "But we do not discriminate due to age or income."



It seems the volunteers are reaching their target audience since the 2013 statistics show that 72 percent of the completed returns were for individuals 60 and above.



"We encourage more people to take advantage of this program," McHugh said. "We do a tremendous repeat business and get referrals all the time; people tell their family and friends."
