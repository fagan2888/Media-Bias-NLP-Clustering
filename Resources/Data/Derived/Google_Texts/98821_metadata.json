This revenue growth is mainly attributed to an increase in the company\u2019s Medicaid enrollments and dual enrollments in 1Q15.\n\nThe percentage of premium revenues from Centene\u2019s new markets increased from 20% in 1Q14 to 23% as a result of expansions or new programs, mainly in Florida, Illinois, and Ohio.\n\nMedicaid enrollments\n\nCentene offered services to 3.1 million Medicaid beneficiaries in 1Q15, an increase of 44% from the 2.1 million enrollments in 1Q14. In 1Q15, Centene served about 331,800 Medicaid members in the markets of California, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Washington through the Medicaid expansion program. In February 2015, the company\u2019s hybrid programs in Indiana and Massachusetts were converted to Medicaid expansion contracts and are thus included in the company\u2019s Medicaid enrollments.\n\nHealth insurance companies (XLV) such as Centene (CNC), Cigna (CI), Humana (HUM), and Anthem (ANTM) enter into managed contracts with state governments to provide health insurance services to Medicaid beneficiaries in exchange for payment from the government.\n\nIn 1Q15, Centene entered into new Medicaid contracts with some states and also succeeded in renewing its contracts in existing markets. In February 2015, Centene entered into a contract with Indiana to provide services under the state\u2019s new program Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0.\n\nCentene\u2019s Medicaid contract in Missouri was renewed in March 2015. The contract is expected to be operational in 3Q15. In 1Q15, the company served about 75,000 Medicaid beneficiaries in Missouri.\n\nLouisiana is one of Centene\u2019s key Medicaid markets. The company\u2019s self-insured Medicaid enrollments in Louisiana declined in 1Q15, as the Medicaid program in the state shifted out of the shared savings ASO (administrative services only), or self-insured enrollment model. These members, amounting to about 200,000 beneficiaries, enrolled in Centene\u2019s full-risk Medicaid program. At the end of 1Q15, Centene\u2019s Medicaid enrollments in Louisiana were about 360,000.\n\nOther government-sponsored programs\n\nIn addition to Medicaid beneficiaries, Centene also actively focuses on other segments of poor populations such as children, ABD (aged, blind, and disabled) beneficiaries, and dual eligibles (or people qualifying for both Medicare and Medicaid insurance). The company offered health insurance services to approximately 0.2 million children and 0.4 million ABD, Medicare, and dual eligible beneficiaries in 1Q15.\n\nIn April 2015, Centene began serving ABD beneficiaries under Indiana\u2019s new Hoosier Care Connect Program. In 2008, the company introduced an innovative product to provide foster care for poor children in Texas. To date, Centene has served about 100,000 foster care beneficiaries in Texas. Centene re-procured this exclusive contract with the Texas government in February of 2015. At the end of 1Q15, Centene had served 30,000 children under this program in Texas.", "article_metadata": {"cXenseParse": {"mre-primary-ticker": "xlv", "mre-content-type": "Post-Release Earnings Reports", "mre-author": "Manali Pradhan", "mre-industry": "Hospitals", "mre-value-driver": "Earnings Overview", "mre-page-type": "post", "mre-section": "Sector Analysis", "mre-sector": "Healthcare", "mre-secondary-ticker": "antm"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.1", "description": "Centene\u2019s premium and service revenues increased by 42% from $3.35 billion in 1Q14 to $4.76 billion in 1Q15."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfeda\"", "article_summary": "Centene Posts Strong 1Q15 Results PART 2 OF 5Strong Government-Sponsored Enrollments Help Centene in 1Q15Revenue growthCentene\u2019s premium and service revenues increased by 42% from $3.35 billion in 1Q14 to $4.76 billion in 1Q15.\nThis revenue growth is mainly attributed to an increase in the company\u2019s Medicaid enrollments and dual enrollments in 1Q15.\nMedicaid enrollmentsCentene offered services to 3.1 million Medicaid beneficiaries in 1Q15, an increase of 44% from the 2.1 million enrollments in 1Q14.\nIn 1Q15, Centene entered into new Medicaid contracts with some states and also succeeded in renewing its contracts in existing markets.\nIn 1Q15, Centene served about 331,800 Medicaid members in the markets of California, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Washington through the Medicaid expansion program."}
