WASHINGTON -- Comedy Channel's The Daily Show had a little fun at Rep. Bill Cassidy's expense on Wednesday night's show.

Host Jon Stewart was doing a segment on the government shutdown, and how, in his view, Republicans are being disingenuous when they say they don't want a government shutdown. He presented a letter signed by 80 House Republicans, including Cassidy, a Baton Rouge Republican, suggesting long before the current crisis that the GOP leadership use the spending bill needed to keep the government open to press the GOP's goal of stopping the Affordable Care Act.

The show's John Oliver chose to make an example of Cassidy, whose sixth district, he noted, was redrawn to make it more heavily white, leaving him, like so many Republicans leading the effort to defund or delay Obamacare, virtually untouchable by a Democratic opponent. Republicans like Cassidy, he said, don't have to worry about voter anger over the government shutdown because they represent safe GOP seats.

Warning: Content is a bit vulgar

Oliver said Cassidy could "poison a basket of kittens in front of another basket of kittens just to make them watch."

"He can do anything as long as Obama didn't help him to it and he'd be fine," Oliver said.

Cassidy, a physician, isn't running for re-election, but challenging Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu in the 2014 Louisiana Senate race.
