He not only played against the Portland Trail Blazers, he started at the Pepsi Center.\n\nIt was the culmination of a whirlwind, scary 18 hours.\n\nFaried suffered a cervical injury after teammate Will Barton inadvertently came down hard on his back and neck after contesting a layup by Golden State\u2019s Klay Thompson late in overtime Saturday night in Oakland. A stunned Faried made his way out of bounds at the next dead ball, which came after that play, and was immediately attended to by the Nuggets training staff. That treatment continued through the remainder of the game \u2014 a 111-108 Nuggets loss in the extra period \u2014 and afterward.\n\nFaried had movement in all of his extremities while being transported off the court but was immobilized on a stretcher and taken to a hospital for precautionary reasons. He stayed in Oakland overnight, was given a clean bill of health and flew home.\n\nThen he suited up.\n\nIn the heat of Saturday\u2019s game, Nuggets coach Michael Malone said he didn\u2019t pay much attention to Faried\u2019s plight, but he did as soon as the game was over.\n\n\u201cNot to sound coldhearted, I wasn\u2019t concerned at all, because we had a game to win,\u201d Malone said. \u201cAfterward, that\u2019s when the concern set in and how was he. You hear he has to go to the hospital, neck injury, that can be very scary. \u2026 Then you think about Kenneth the person, once the game is over. It\u2019s great to have him back.\u201d\n\nEarly Sunday, Faried tweeted: \u201cI\u2019m doing much better a little sore but I\u2019m the Manimal I\u2019m not going to (let) this keep me down & out long!\u201d\n\nFootnotes. The Nuggets got the services of injured forward Kostas Papanikolaou back Sunday. He missed Saturday\u2019s game because of a sprained left ankle. \u2026 Denver rookie Emmanuel Mudiay remains out of the lineup but could return to uniform at some point this week.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kenneth Faried plays vs. Blazers one day after scary neck injury", "title": "Kenneth Faried plays vs. Blazers one day after scary neck injury", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/03/kenneth-faried-plays-vs-blazers-one-day-after-scary-neck-injury/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160103__kenneth-faried-on-stretcherp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160103__kenneth-faried-on-stretcherp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-03T17:24:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T23:25:38+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcec8b\"", "article_summary": "You hear he has to go to the hospital, neck injury, that can be very scary.\nHours after being released from an Oakland, Calif.-area hospital Sunday, Nuggets forward Kenneth Faried was back in uniform.\nIn the heat of Saturday\u2019s game, Nuggets coach Michael Malone said he didn\u2019t pay much attention to Faried\u2019s plight, but he did as soon as the game was over.\nHe missed Saturday\u2019s game because of a sprained left ankle.\n\u2026 Denver rookie Emmanuel Mudiay remains out of the lineup but could return to uniform at some point this week."}
