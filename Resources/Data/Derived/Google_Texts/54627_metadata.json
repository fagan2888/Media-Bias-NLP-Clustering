Most lower income earners who need care in old age instead spend down their assets until they are eligible for the taxpayer-funded Medicaid program \u2014 called MaineCare in Maine \u2014 to pick up the tab.\n\nBut the roughly 35,000 Maine residents who do have private coverage for nursing home care, assisted living or in-home services have seen sharp increases in their annual premiums over recent years as companies that issued their policies come to grips with years of high expenses and low revenues.\n\nAfter approving a series of double-digit rate increases over the past five years, Maine Insurance Superintendent Eric Cioppa has scheduled a daylong public forum for Monday, May 9, in Augusta to take oral and written testimony from policyholders, insurers and advocates. This is not a formal rate hearing for the purpose of evaluating a proposed increase. His goal is to gain a fuller understanding of the likely need for more rate hikes going forward as well as the impact on consumers.\n\n\u201cAs the regulator of insurance companies selling long-term care policies in Maine, I want to hear firsthand from those who purchased and are relying on these policies and those who sold the policies and are continuing to request substantial rate hikes,\u201d Cioppa said in a written notice about the forum. He added that the forum is an opportunity for consumers to understand the role of the insurance bureau and to hear company\u2019s explain the need for the recent increases.\n\nThe informational forum is an outgrowth of proposed rule changes this winter that would have capped rate increases in the long term care market, a failed measure Cioppa opposed for its inflexibility to industry needs while acknowledging the burden imposed on consumers by repeated rate hikes.\n\n\u201cWe understand the hardship that rate increases put on consumers, especially retirees who may be on fixed incomes and who have to make difficult choices to retain their policies,\u201d he wrote in his testimony.\n\nThe deadline for scheduling an oral statement at the forum is Monday, April 25.\n\nUnder Maine law, Cioppa\u2019s office is charged with reviewing proposed rate increases for all long-term care policies and approving, amending or denying them based on a combination of public and business considerations, including consumer protection and the ability of companies to fulfill their obligations to policyholders.\n\nActuaries, the statistical experts behind insurance companies\u2019 risk and pricing strategies \u201cgot a lot of their assumptions very wrong\u201d when they launched their long-term insurance lines back in the 1980s, Cioppa said in a phone interview earlier this week from New Orleans, where he was attending the annual meeting of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The issue of long-term care underwriting is a hot topic across the country, he said, though regulations vary from state to state.\n\nThe experts failed to accurately predict some key actuarial trends, Cioppa said, including the national increase in longevity, the rising incidence of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia, the length of time people would spend in long-term care and the relatively few policyholders who would drop their coverage after paying in to the companies for a period of years. At the same time, investments that companies make with their premium dollars have performed poorly in the shaky economy, driving down essential revenues.\n\nIt took insurers years to compile the claims data companies needed to support the need for significant premium increases, Cioppa said, so those increases have been frequent and steep in recent years after being mostly unchanged in the past. Some companies have lost money to the point of becoming unstable, and many have stopped selling long-term care policies while maintaining other, more secure lines of business. Of the approximately 50 companies that were issuing long-term care policies in Maine in the 1980s, only 10 remain in the market, Cioppa said.\n\nOne of the largest is Tennessee-based Unum, which has offices in South Portland. The company issued policies nationwide, to individuals and through employer benefit plans, between 1989 and 2012, before withdrawing from the long-term market altogether. Unum still administers about 16,500 plans in Maine and more than 1 million across the country, paying out more than $370 million in benefits during 2015.\n\nIn testimony provided at a rate hearing in Pennsylvania last month, Unum\u2019s Steve Zabel, who oversees product lines no longer actively marketed by the company, said \u201csignificant\u201d losses related to long-term care policies have adversely affected the company\u2019s other insurance divisions including disability, life, dental and vision insurance. Although premium increases are needed to stabilize revenues, Zabel said, policyholders should also be allowed to adjust their benefits, level of inflation protection, length of benefit period and other policy provisions to help hold their down costs.\n\nLori Parham, state director for AARP in Maine, will be participating in the May 9 hearing at Cioppa\u2019s invitation, to share the organization\u2019s consumer-based perspective and resources for seniors considering long-term care insurance. Consumer protections are essential, Parham said, including clear buyer information about policy provisions, a \u201cnonforfeiture\u201d option that provides a level of benefit even if a policy is canceled and increased availability of more affordable \u201cpartnership\u201d plans that protect some personal assets in the spend-down toward Medicaid eligibility for long-term care.\n\nThe insurance forum will be held from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday, May 9, at the Augusta Civic Center. A live, interactive webcast will be available through the Bureau of Insurance website, maine.gov/insurance, and a video recording will be posted there after the event.
