It was April of 2010, when fire destroyed the iconic treasure ship restaurant off Thomas drive.

"People still come till this day, come looking for the ship," said Matt Moorish, fisherman.

The treasure ship had been a landmark in the community since it opened in 19-78.

"I just remember how majestic it looked. So cool looking and excellent food, reasonable prices and I like that the little bar down here overlooked the water. "

The property has been vacant for several years, but not for too much longer.

Another popular restaurant is moving to the site.

The boatyard will construct an entirely new building to call home.

That leaves the boatyard's current location available for bud and alleys to move-in.

Owners already have plans for the new sister to their original seaside location.

"We’re really going to be focusing on the beautiful roof deck and we're going to be serving lunch and dinner there on the roof deck and we are also going to have late night djs and bands. And really bring some nightlife to grand lagoon," said Dave Rauschkolb, Bud & Alleys owner.

These new restaurants will be creating dozens of new jobs.

"We have a lot of talent at bud and alleys that we're going to be bringing over there as well as hiring a whole lot of people," said Rauschkolb.

And as for added competition, current restaurant owners and managers say more choices will be good for everyone.

"We’re so thrilled the new restaurants are coming to the area. We wish them the best of luck," said Mia Howard, runaway bay coordinator.
