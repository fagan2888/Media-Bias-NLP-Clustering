About 92 percent of covered employees agreed to have blood tests for common medical issues \u2013 high cholesterol or blood sugar, for example \u2013 with an option to sign up for health coaching if a problem shows up.\n\nAt first, some town employees were alarmed.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of questions about privacy,\u201d said Kennie Wells, the town\u2019s assistant human resources director. \u201cPeople were concerned that the town would get the results. But we assured them that wasn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d\n\nThe incentive was that town employees who signed up receive a 12 percent reduction on their insurance premiums.\n\nPalm Beach is a self-insured municipality, which means that actual claim costs come out of town coffers. That comes to an average of $300,000 per year under the plan that is administered by Florida Blue.\n\nKeeping those claims costs from spiraling is the goal of the program overseen by the town\u2019s human resources department, said Director Danielle Olson.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been looking at this for a few years,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a new insurance broker that has had some experience with wellness programs.\n\nThey came through with a few different options, along with some of the legal changes that came down the pike with the Affordable Care Act in terms of what you\u2019re allowed to do with wellness incentives. From those two elements we developed the program.\u201d\n\nEmployers need to tread carefully in this area, particularly after a program at Pennsylvania State University was botched last fall and generated a lot of negative publicity. The school\u2019s wellness plan levied a $100 \u201cnoncompliance fee\u201d aimed at workers who refused to fill out an online questionnaire, according to The New York Times. The form, designed by WebMD Health Services, asked workers about their marriage and finances, and asked female employees whether they planned to become pregnant. The program was scrapped after university employees complained it was an invasion of privacy.\n\nIn Palm Beach, the town will see only cumulative data representing the health of the whole workforce. Blood tests are administered by Quest Diagnostics. The employee takes the results and goes online to do a health risk assessment.\n\nThey get a report on recommendations for changes they can make to improve their health. Florida Blue may offer them health coaching. Under that scenario, a professional works with them by phone or over the Internet to address dietary or other lifestyle changes. It won\u2019t be mandatory to accept the coaching, however.\n\nThe town expects to see the overview of the test results in February.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen places go as far as having penalties, but it\u2019s not our style,\u201d Olson said. \u201cThis is going to be handled outside, as private as possible. There\u2019s no organizational benefit to know someone\u2019s personal health information. We get charged based on the experience of the entire group.\u201d\n\nIf the group report shows a large percentage of workers have a particular health issue, education programs may be offered. Or, services that address that problem might be offered to people at a reduced cost.\n\nThe town won\u2019t know whether workers are getting healthier as a group until they take the same tests next year.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t predict we\u2019ll start seeing differences until we get to the three- to five-year mark because we have to implement those plan design changes,\u201d said Olson. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say positive change isn\u2019t happening. It\u2019s just a matter of calculating the return on investment.\u201d\n\nHave wellness programs brought down health care costs for other employers? Results have been mixed.\n\nIn a 2012 survey of employers with wellness features by insurance broker Willis Americas, 29 percent reported that health risks were improving while 46 percent said there was no change. Four percent said health risks were getting worse. Sixteen percent said claim costs were decreasing while 10 percent said they were increasing.\n\nAnalysts argued in the report that if the majority of the workforce sees improving health risks, or stable risks, that still helps keep a lid on costs for employers.\n\nA Harvard Business Review article about the wellness program at the pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson in December 2010 was more enthusiastic. It said company leaders estimated that wellness saved $250 million health care costs from 2000 to 2009, and the return on investment was $2.71 for every dollar spent.\n\nAnd in a survey published last month by the Society for Human Resources Management, 71 percent of companies or organizations with wellness initiatives said they were \u201cvery effective\u201d or \u201csomewhat effective\u201d in reducing health care costs.\n\nThere is a third element to the Palm Beach plan. Participants have to sign an affidavit saying that they do not use tobacco products \u2013 or that they stopped using tobacco as of Jan. 1 \u2013 in order to qualify for the insurance discounts.\n\n\u201cI further understand that if I use tobacco products after claiming non-tobacco use, the Wellness Incentive will be void retroactive to the first day of the 2014 plan year and I will be responsible to repay any premium discount I received to the town prior to the end of the plan year,\u201d the affidavit says.\n\nOther penalties may include disciplinary action or termination.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With health care costs on the rise, U.", "og": {"url": "http://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/news/local-govt-politics/majority-of-town-workers-part-of-new-wellness-prog/ncmYr/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2014/01/13/d1/8a/011014_Olson.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "With health care costs on the rise, U.", "title": "Majority of town workers part of new wellness program"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2014/01/13/d1/8a/011014_Olson.jpg", "description": "With health care costs on the rise, U.S. employers are looking for ways to promote a healthier workforce with the emphasis on preventive measures rather than waiting for big problems later.", "site": "@shinysheet", "card": "summary", "title": "Majority of town workers part of new wellness program"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "palmbeachdailynews", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/news/local-govt-politics/majority-of-town-workers-part-of-new-wellness-prog/ncmYr/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/2243013/news/news/local-govt-politics/majority-of-town-workers-part-of-new-wellness-prog/ncmYr/", "keywords": "centerpiece", "google-site-verification": "lgU00SzU_ChqK0qFbu4lYha8V6ghHO9uTf0LHHcoQ98", "news_keywords": "centerpiece"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce455\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s just a matter of calculating the return on investment.\u201dHave wellness programs brought down health care costs for other employers?\nBut we assured them that wasn\u2019t going to happen.\u201dThe incentive was that town employees who signed up receive a 12 percent reduction on their insurance premiums.\nAt first, some town employees were alarmed.\nThe school\u2019s wellness plan levied a $100 \u201cnoncompliance fee\u201d aimed at workers who refused to fill out an online questionnaire, according to The New York Times.\nTown Director of Human Resources Danielle Olson, left, and Kennie Wells, the assistant director, were part of the team that implemented the town's Wellness Program."}
