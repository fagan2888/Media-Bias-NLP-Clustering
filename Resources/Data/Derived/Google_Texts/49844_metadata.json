A University of Minnesota study credited the Affordable Care Act for dropping the state's uninsured numbers to roughly 5 percent, making it the one of the lowest in the country. Minnesota also touts the lowest premium rates and generally low health care costs.\n\nThose statistics have made it more difficult for businessman Mike McFadden, the GOP's nominee, to challenge Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., for supporting the president\u2019s signature health care law. Franken is the front-runner in the race, and independent polls show him with a small double-digit lead .\n\n\u201cThe Republicans hope that the toxicity of the moniker Obamacare would lead to this kind of mob running against the Democrats has not happened. Voters are hearing different things,\u201d said Larry Jacobs, a political science professor at University of Minnesota. \u201cIt\u2019s turning out that Democrats have found strategies to fight to a draw, which in 2014 is probably the best they could hope for, at least on this issue.\u201d Franken\u2019s campaign has focused on the state\u2019s achievements and the more popular aspects of the law, including a provision he helped craft that requires health insurers to spend at least 80 percent of premium dollars on services, as opposed to administrative overhead.\n\nMcFadden initially opposed that language as part of his position to repeal the health care law, but he later said he would consider keeping the policy when pressed on the issue in an August interview with WCCO-TV . In a recent debate, McFadden has said his major gripe with the health care law is that states can make better decisions than the White House.\n\n\"I believe the states are laboratories for experiment,\" he said in an Oct. 1 debate.\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=EF23YQKyLeo&feature=youtu.be\n\n\"If we allow the federal government to do it, our health care system will look like the VA, and I'm not going to allow that to happen.\"\n\nFranken warned repealing the law could lead to greater frustrations, sending a divided Congress back to the drawing board.\n\n\u201cDo you think this Congress now, as gridlocked as it is, is actually going to come up with a health care plan with guarantees to cover pre-existing conditions and all the other stuff that we\u2019ve seen?\u201d Franken concluded in the debate.\n\nTo be sure, the rollout of the Minnesota health care exchange last October was as rocky as the Healthcare.gov launch. Software errors and technical glitches ultimately lead to the resignation of MNsure\u2019s first executive director.\n\nBut things have been smoother for MNsure since then \u2014 at least until last month when Preferred One, the cheapest and largest provider that carried 53 percent of the state exchange\u2019s commercial plans, withdrew from the exchange. Two weeks later, the Minnesota Commerce Department announced premium rates are expected to increase an average of 4.5 percent in 2015.\n\nA Democratic strategist familiar with Senate races said though Democrats did not make the health care law a centerpiece of their campaigns, they were concerned those two events would cause their numbers drop.\n\nDespite Republican attempts to tie those issues to the candidates, polls since then show Democrats maintaining or improving their leads in the state, the strategist said.\n\nIn surveys, Minnesotans mirror the nation\u2019s discontent with the health care law; 44 percent said they consider MNsure \"mostly a failure\" in a September poll . However that has yet to sway their opinion in the Senate race. The same poll showed Franken\u2019s support at 49 percent, a number that has not changed by much since then .\n\n\"I haven't seen it working,\" the strategist said. \"The die is just so far cast.\"\n\nMcFadden and his supporters say Franken\u2019s support of the health care law exemplifies the incumbent\u2019s partisan slant and blame him for following the party line to bring a \u201cWashington-based policy\u201d to the state.\n\n\u201cA lot of things that we\u2019ve seen MNsure, for lack of a better word, \u2018solve\u2019 were already things that our existing program could have done,\u201d said John Rouleau, executive director of the right-leaning Minnesota Jobs Coalition \u201cAnd things that MNsure has done, it hasn\u2019t done that well.\u201d\n\nFranken has also been criticized for not pushing harder against a medical device tax included in the health care law, which affects the hundreds of medical device companies in the state, including Medtronic and St. Jude Medical. Franken, a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, says he worked with former Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus to cut the tax in half and has since advocated for repealing that part of the law.\n\nMinnesotans disgruntled about the state\u2019s health care program also may decide to place the blame on the governor\u2019s desk instead of Franken\u2019s.\n\nMcFadden\u2019s argument requires voters to tie what\u2019s happening in the state to what the federal government did, said Steven Schier, a political science professor at Carleton College in Northfield. Meanwhile, the debate in the gubernatorial race about state management is gaining more traction, he said.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, Mark Dayton is going to be held responsible for that, not Al Franken,\u201d Schier said.\n\nThe Rothenberg Political Report/Roll Call rates this race as Democrat Favored .\n\nRelated Stories: Al Franken Up 7 Points in Republican Poll Pat Roberts Ranks Among Most Vulnerable Senators DSCC Raised $16 Million in September Harry Reid to Fundraise for Two Democrats in Lake Tahoe Roll Call Election Map: Race Ratings for Every Seat Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call in your inbox or on your iPhone.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Republican critique of the president's health care overhaul law may have hit a wall in Minnesota, complicating the GOP's already long chances of picking up a Senate seat in the state.", "og": {"site_name": "Roll Call", "description": "The Republican critique of the president's health care overhaul law may have hit a wall in Minnesota, complicating the GOP's already long chances of picking up a Senate seat in the state.", "title": "A Senate Race Where Democrats Neutralized Obamacare Attacks", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/elections-2014-al-franken-obamacare-mike-mcfadden", "image": {"identifier": "http://cdn.images.rollcall.com/image/1ed71e81ff466910ac598f06d393a96c/atr/franken_256_072414-445x296.jpg", "type": "image/png"}, "updated_time": "2014-10-16T19:14:27Z", "type": "website"}, "abstract": "The Republican critique of the president's health care overhaul law may have hit a wall in Minnesota, complicating the GOP's already long chances of picking up a Senate seat in the state.", "fb": {"app_id": 1383531991672364}, "keywords": "Blog ID,Author,category,author,CQToday Topic,minn-senate,poli", "article": {"section": "home", "published_time": "2014-10-16T19:14:27Z", "modified_time": "2014-10-16T19:14:27Z"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Republican critique of the president's health care overhaul law may have hit a wall in Minnesota, complicating the GOP's already long chances of picking up a Senate seat in the state.", "title": "A Senate Race Where Democrats Neutralized Obamacare Attacks", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/elections-2014-al-franken-obamacare-mike-mcfadden", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.images.rollcall.com/image/1ed71e81ff466910ac598f06d393a96c/atr/franken_256_072414-445x296.jpg"}, "site": "@rollcall", "card": "summary |player (See: https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player We will have to submit a test and get approval before using this type)"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd555\"", "article_summary": "To be sure, the rollout of the Minnesota health care exchange last October was as rocky as the Healthcare.gov launch.\nMinnesotans disgruntled about the state\u2019s health care program also may decide to place the blame on the governor\u2019s desk instead of Franken\u2019s.\nIn surveys, Minnesotans mirror the nation\u2019s discontent with the health care law; 44 percent said they consider MNsure \"mostly a failure\" in a September poll .\nThough the state\u2019s health care exchange, MNsure, has hit a few snags in recent weeks, local Democrats still claim the program is an overall success \u2014 at least relative to other states.\nA Democratic strategist familiar with Senate races said though Democrats did not make the health care law a centerpiece of their campaigns, they were concerned those two events would cause their numbers drop."}
