It starts with Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n\u2019s arrival in 1513 to the founding of the first permanent Spanish settlement in 1565, and concludes with the building of the first fort with a garrison of free Africans, slaves that had run away from the British colonies in 1738.\n\nThe exhibit details the interaction between Native Americans, Europeans and Africans that led to the creation of a society. \u201cA generation was born, raised and died during that period,\u201d museum Executive Director Rui Farias said.\n\nThe exhibit was curated by University of South Florida-St. Petersburg Professor J. Michael Francis, whose area of research is early Florida history. He was asked to put together a proposal for the exhibit that incorporated new research. It was approved in 2012 and, between then and spring 2013, he worked with groups Abbsolute and Accti\u00f3n Cultural de Espa\u00f1a to put the traveling exhibit together.\n\nThe exhibit is designed to be interactive, incorporating computers and iPads for visitors to use. Some displays have interactive video. A fountain of youth is at the end of exhibit for visitors to walk through. It also includes figures, models, paintings depicting the time. Francis\u2019 goal was to create a fun and entertaining exhibit that gave a new perspective.\n\nThe exhibit, officially owned by the Spanish government, was built in Miami and so far has only been shown in Tallahassee.\n\nThe St. Petersburg Museum of History, 335 Second Ave. N.E., is open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and noon to 5 p.m. Sunday. General admission is $15, $12 for seniors, $9 for military veterans, students and children ages 6 to 17. Children younger than age 6 are admitted free. The exhibit will remain open until March 1, and then moved to St. Augustine.\n\nmthomas@tampatrib.com\n\n(727) 828-6766", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 13 Sep 2014 20:54:10 -0400", "Description": "ST.
