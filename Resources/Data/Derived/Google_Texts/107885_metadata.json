One woman died of exposure in Omaha.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, the mercury was unable to top 11 degrees below zero, Omaha's coldest December day on record.\n\n\u201cThe weather was horrible,\u201d Carlee Seeba recalls.\n\nDuring her father-in-law's funeral 30 years ago this week, the pipes froze at the family's home and relatives returned to water and ice everywhere, she said. \u201cIt was brutal.\u201d\n\nThat's how South Omahan Kathy Raabe, then a single mother of three, remembers it.\n\nLike many others, she lugged her car battery indoors at night so that it wouldn't freeze up and she could get to work the next day. She kept her kids bundled up, even indoors.\n\n\u201cYou did what you had to do to get by,\u201d she said.\n\nOnce people got to work, they didn't take their cars for granted either.\n\nKathy Haffke recalled going outside to start her car several times a day so that she could get home.\n\n\u201cAlso, the power steering was very stiff and so were the brakes,\u201d she said. \u201cHorrible cold!\u201d\n\nIn Denison, Iowa, Chris Kuehnhold's family hung black plastic tarp around their Plymouth station wagon while they repaired its broken timing chain. \u201c(We) put 10 heat lamps inside the makeshift garage and still had to wear face masks to breathe and keep from freezing our lungs,\u201d he said.\n\nWith local homeless shelters full, Omaha officials tacitly disregarded code violations and allowed the St. Vincent de Paul Center to open a then-unfinished shelter on 17th Street. Aid agencies brought in cots, blankets, porta-potties, wood stoves and kerosene and space heaters.\n\nThe Metropolitan Utilities District hired extra workers to help with frozen water meters, broken gas and water lines and the several hundred furnaces that wouldn't work.\n\nA one-day respite from the cold, on Dec. 27, had Omaha's Public Works Department scrambling to break loose the snow frozen in streets, haul away ice chunks and spread gravel to improve traction.\n\nEppley Airfield had what an official described as a \u201cnightmarish\u201d week as flights, passengers and baggage stacked up. At one point, only two of the airport's tankers were able to refuel jets.\n\nThe month also turned deadly.\n\nA woman found outside near 16th and Cass Streets a few days after Christmas died of exposure.\n\nThree children were killed when a semitrailer truck plowed into disabled vehicles in a snowy chain-reaction accident near Greeley, Neb. A teenager died when he lost control of his car on a windy, snowy road near Geneva, Neb. And in Iowa, two women were killed in a crash on Interstate 35.\n\nLivestock losses doubled at the end of December. Even so, the losses were not nearly as severe as this year's October blizzard in northwest Nebraska.\n\nMayes said the cold was remarkable for many reasons. The warming planet has made record cold half as common as it used to be, relative to record warmth.\n\n\u201cIt's just harder to get that cold,\u201d she said.\n\nMany of the records that were broken by the 1983 Arctic outbreak had been in place since the late 1800s to early 1900s, Mayes said. Outside of a cold spell in 1989, most of the 1983 records remain in place.\n\nKen Dewey, a climatologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, said a big problem that accompanied the 1983 cold was the slushy snow that fell Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nImmediately after that storm, temperatures dropped and generally didn't climb above freezing until January. Any road, sidewalk or driveway that didn't get cleared over the Thanksgiving holiday remained a frozen mess.\n\nTravel on many Lincoln residential streets was restricted to a set of deep frozen ruts, he said.\n\nBrenda Helget drove her Pontiac Catalina along Lincoln's ruts before dawn every day, delivering The World-Herald.\n\n\u201cI remember being terrified my oil pan would get ripped to shreds,\u201d she said. \u201cBack in those days, there were no cellphones. If I got stuck, there was nobody to call.\u201d\n\nThe snow from Thanksgiving remained on the ground until a February thaw, Dewey said.\n\nSuccessive snowfalls added to the problems.\n\nBy Christmas Day that year, Omaha had 13 inches of snow on the ground, Grand Island 15 inches and Hastings 19 inches.\n\n\u201cIt didn't look like Nebraska,\u201d Dewey said. \u201cThe snow just got deeper and deeper.\u201d\n\nThis report includes material from the World-Herald archives.\n\nPost by Omaha World-Herald.\n\nCurrent conditions and forecast", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "During the week before Christmas that year, it never got above zero in Omaha.", "title": "Frozen in our memories: Readers recall coldest December on record \u2014 in 1983", "url": "http://www.omaha.com/news/frozen-in-our-memories-readers-recall-coldest-december-on-record/article_d75317ba-4c43-587a-8f13-02a187d1114f.html", "image": {"width": 518, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/c7/5c7eab3e-92f5-5c9a-ba4b-6dfd40f42a4f/5332ef0af3b30.image.jpg?resize=518%2C759", "height": 759}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@OWHnews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "During the week before Christmas that year, it never got above zero in Omaha.", "fb": {"app_id": 117714391577072}, "keywords": "news,weather", "google-site-verification": "gE-kSjgMAF16OyUU3QCB0Ap0PQnFlh5oPdueJO6D2cQ", "news_keywords": "news,weather"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd24a2\"", "article_summary": "The warming planet has made record cold half as common as it used to be, relative to record warmth.\nOn Christmas Eve, the mercury was unable to top 11 degrees below zero, Omaha's coldest December day on record.\nA woman found outside near 16th and Cass Streets a few days after Christmas died of exposure.\nThirty years ago, the coldest December on record brought unrelenting misery across much of the nation, including Nebraska and Iowa.\nBy Christmas Day that year, Omaha had 13 inches of snow on the ground, Grand Island 15 inches and Hastings 19 inches."}
