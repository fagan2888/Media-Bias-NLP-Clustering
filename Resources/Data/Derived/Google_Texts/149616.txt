Starbucks opened its first store in Hanoi on Wednesday, expanding its presence Vietnam, one of the world’s largest coffee-growing countries.

The store at the corner of Hang Bai Street and Ly Thuong Kiet Street–one of the busiest business corners in Hanoi–is the first of the three outlets the coffee chain plans to open in the city this month. Starbucks entered Vietnam in February last year with its first stores in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam’s economic hub. It now has eight outlets there.

“We look at Vietnam and we see so much potential. It’s such a vibrant and exciting market,” said Jeff Hansberry, president of Starbucks China and Asia Pacific, who was joined by U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam David Shear and city officials for the Hanoi store’s grand opening.

Starbucks will face competition from Vietnamese coffee shops, which are found throughout the city. As the Seattle-based company celebrated the opening of its first store in Hanoi, Phuong Linh, a Vietnamese coffee shop just a few steps away, was full of customers.

“I prefer Vietnamese coffee because it is stronger,” said 35-year-old taxi driver Tran Duc Minh. “Vietnamese coffee is cheaper and is the real stuff for coffee addicts,” he said.

Starbucks’ coffee will be priced slightly higher than most of its local competitors with prices ranging from 35,000 dong to 105,000 dong ($1.65 to about $5) a cup, depending on the drink size. A cup of traditional Vietnamese coffee at a local cafe generally costs about 20,000 dong, or less than $1.
