His owner, Ashley Reed Okura, has had him since he was a kitten and she was 7.\n\nIt's the second time Corduroy has claimed the title. He was first recognized last year until officials discovered another cat, Tiffany Two, which lived to be just over 27. Corduroy reclaimed the title after Tiffany Two's death.\n\nOkura told The Oregonian (http://bit.ly/1JhCCrj ) that Corduroy is still active and in good health, except for some kidney problems. He still hunts on the family's 160-acre property.\n\nFor his birthday Aug. 1, Okura bought him a live white mouse from Petco and says he enjoyed it \"right away.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A 26-year-old cat in Oregon has been named the oldest living cat by Guinness World Records.", "language": "english", "author": "The Associated Press", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/26-year-old-cat-in-Oregon-is-worlds-oldest-alive--321985302.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/432*315/Cat-paws.gif", "type": "article", "description": "A 26-year-old cat in Oregon has been named the oldest living cat by Guinness World Records.", "title": "26-year-old cat in Oregon is world's oldest alive"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "A 26-year-old cat in Oregon has been named the oldest living cat by Guinness World Records.", "title": "26-year-old cat in Oregon is world's oldest alive", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/26-year-old-cat-in-Oregon-is-worlds-oldest-alive--321985302.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Cat-paws.gif", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "26-year-old cat in Oregon is world's oldest alive", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "26yearold cat in Oregon is"}, "article_summary": "SISTERS, Ore. \u2014 A 26-year-old cat in Oregon has been named the oldest living cat by Guinness World Records.\nThe cat named Corduroy is owned by a family in the central Oregon city of Sisters.\nHe was first recognized last year until officials discovered another cat, Tiffany Two, which lived to be just over 27.\nFor his birthday Aug. 1, Okura bought him a live white mouse from Petco and says he enjoyed it \"right away.\nOkura told The Oregonian (http://bit.ly/1JhCCrj ) that Corduroy is still active and in good health, except for some kidney problems."}
