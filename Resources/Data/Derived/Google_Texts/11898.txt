A Manhattan day care provider faces criminal charges after a child in her care fell twice in the same day.

The Kansas Department of Health and Environment issued an emergency order suspending the license of Aunt Lesas Daycare, 525 Northfield Road.

KDHE received a complaint alleging the day care provider was holding an infant above her head when the child's head struck a ceiling fan. The complaint said the day care provider dropped the infant who hit the couch and then fell to the floor. On the same day, the same infant was left unattended and fell off a couch. The complaint also said the day care provider didn't seek medical care for the child or notify his parents.

Lesa Marie Heiman has been charged with aggravated battery and child endangerment in Riley County District Court.
