Erik Duffy saw a nearly 7-foot wall of snow and ice barreling toward his truck as he was finishing food deliveries in Boulder on Friday, but he couldn’t get out of the way.

The snow was pushed down Broadway near Mapleton Avenue by what he believes to be a city of Boulder snowplow that was southbound as he was headed north.

Duffy started slowing as he saw the large load headed toward him, but another car kept him from changing lanes. “I thought ‘This is odd,’ ” he said. “I’ve never seen them push snow into oncoming traffic. Then I just get blasted with this huge wall of snow, ice and everything that was in there.”

The windshield of Duffy’s 2014 Dodge Ram 3500 caved in, causing an explosion of glass shards. Unable to see, Duffy rolled down his window, put his hazard lights on and managed to drive five miles to his house. Aside from some minor cuts, Duffy said he was uninjured.

Once home, Duffy called the police and reported the incident. He also called the city of Boulder.

He said he hasn’t heard much back from either entity, although he was told the city was investigating whether it was, in fact, their plow. “I guess it’s possible that there’s some kind of Robin Hood-type person that was plowing the roads for the city, but I kind of doubt it.”
