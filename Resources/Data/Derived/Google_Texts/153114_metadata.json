They backed Cruz even though billionaire businessman Trump is the front-runner in the national GOP race and had a last-minute rally in Wichita.\n\nMalarie Hancock, a 27-year-old stay at home mom who caucused in Topeka, said she supported Cruz because her main concern was abortion and \u201cthe right for unborn children to live.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a Christian and I believe that he will make the right decisions,\u201d Hancock said. She thinks that Cruz would have a better chance of winning if Florida Sen. Marco Rubio dropped out, but \u201cI don\u2019t fault him for not dropping out.\u201d Rubio was running third in Kansas results.\n\nIn Wichita, Barb Berry, a 67-year-old retired AT&T; manager, was drawn to Cruz by his stance on repealing the health care law and cited the candidate\u2019s opposition to abortion as something that is \u201cvery important to me.\u201d\n\nKansas Democrats also were caucusing, with supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders hoping to boost his challenge against former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\nKansas Republican leaders reported heavy turnout on Saturday. State GOP Executive Director Clay Barker said Saturday that even small counties were reporting more voters than they had anticipated. The party printed up 60,000 paper ballots in case the turnout was about twice as large as it was in 2008 and 2012, but told workers at the 103 caucus sites to be prepared to copy extra ballots.\n\nMost of the Kansas GOP\u2019s establishment was wary of Trump and were instead split between Cruz and Rubio. Trump told thousands of supporters in Wichita that he had been scheduled to attend an annual gathering of national conservative leaders today, but backed out to attend the Kansas rally.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump encourages his supporters to go caucus after a campaign rally Saturday in Wichita.\n\nConnie Belton, 65, a retired homemaker from Wichita, watched Trump\u2019s rally in Wichita and said that if the party kicks him out at the last minute she is going to write his name in on the ballot.\n\nVoting at Olathe South High School, Betty Nixon, 60, a retired insurance company manager and Army captain voted for Trump to show her frustration with GOP elites.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my opportunity to revolt,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to be a part of a revolt.\u201d\n\nAmong Democrats, many of Sanders\u2019 supporters talked about being part of a revolution. They lined the streets outside Liberty Memorial Central Middle School in Lawrence, a crowd much larger than had turned out for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton there.\n\nThough Clinton is the choice of former Gov. Kathleen Sebelius and other state party establishment figures, Clinton faced a surge of new voters and energized progressives supporting Sanders. Democrats caucused at 47 sites.\n\nLynette Good, 30, a secretary in state government, voted for Sanders in Lawrence.\n\n\u201cHe makes more sense than Hillary Clinton. He\u2019s been funded by individuals instead of corporations. It seems like he knows more about what the people need.\u201d\n\nMany of Clinton\u2019s supporters saw her political experience and pragmatism as important, arguing that she\u2019ll be more likely to make progress on Democratic goals.\n\nLinda Manley, a 54-year-old middle school teacher in Topeka, is a Clinton supporter. She likes much of what Sanders says but added, \u201cI just don\u2019t know how it will happen.\u201d\n\nKansas Democrats have four superdelegates who can vote for the candidate of their choice. The Democratic caucuses will proportionally allocate the other 33 delegates.\n\nRepublicans have 40 delegates to their national convention at stake, with 37 allocated proportionally among the candidates receiving at least 10 percent of the vote. The other three were party leaders required to back the statewide winner. Ted Cruz will collect at least 17 delegates for winning Kansas, and Donald Trump will win at least six, according to a delegate count by The Associated Press.\n\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.
