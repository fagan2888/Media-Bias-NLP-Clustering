But on Saturday, it was heavy holiday congestion that slowed down drivers \u2014 in both directions.\n\nAnd the Colorado Department of Transportation says to expect more of the same all week as Front Range residents who are off work or school flock to the mountains.\n\n\u201cThe more we can spread out the peak (hours), the less time you\u2019ll be on the highway,\u201d CDOT spokeswoman Amy Ford said.\n\nOn Saturday, holiday travelers aiming to outsmart the usual traffic congestion by leaving Denver mid-afternoon were in for a rude awakening.\n\nSki traffic in the morning didn\u2019t let up, and CDOT at 4:15 p.m. was reporting crawling speeds on westbound Interstate 70 beginning at Floyd Hill.\n\nEastbound, the return trip to Denver was the usual Saturday story, taking an extra hour or more to get there from Silverthorne. About 4 p.m., CDOT reported that it had started safety metering from Silverthorne to the Eisenhower Tunnel to stagger traffic flow.\n\nThat was before an accident caused a full closure of I-70 in both directions at Silver Plume for a half-hour.\n\nA short time later, all eastbound lanes were blocked by another accident that quickly was cleared.\n\nElsewhere, CDOT on Saturday afternoon reopened the ramp from westbound C-470 to eastbound I-70 after a five-hour closure caused by a tractor-trailer rollover and another accident.\n\nIn the coming week, CDOT says to expect heavy mountain traffic in both directions of I-70 daily, based on previous years\u2019 holiday patterns. They expect the heaviest eastbound return traffic to begin on New Year\u2019s Day, peaking from 4 to 6 p.m.\n\nAvoid driving back to Denver on I-70 next weekend, when hour-plus delays are likely much of both days. Check current travel conditions and speeds by calling 511, downloading CDOT\u2019s mobile phone app or visiting cotrip.org.\n\nAs for the coming snow, the National Weather Service says frigid cold will keep it light in the Denver metro area. After a forecast high near 35 degrees Sunday, Denver\u2019s high temperatures should reach only 11 degrees on Monday and 6 degrees on Tuesday.\n\nBut overnight lows are forecast to sink into the negative single digits.\n\n\u201cLooks like anywhere from 3\u00bd to 6 inches\u201d of snow between Sunday night and Tuesday night, meteorologist Bob Koopmeiners said.\n\nPowder days are possible for skiers and snowboarders, he said, with 6 to 16 inches possible through Tuesday in the mountains.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Traffic snarl on I-70 in mountains likely to recur throughout week", "title": "Traffic snarl on I-70 in mountains likely to recur throughout week", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/27/traffic-snarl-on-i-70-in-mountains-likely-to-recur-throughout-week/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141227__BN20141228_Z00_BNCD28HOLIDAYp1.jpg", "height": 456}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141227__BN20141228_Z00_BNCD28HOLIDAYp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-27T16:54:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T08:10:19+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In the coming week, CDOT says to expect heavy mountain traffic in both directions of I-70 daily, based on previous years\u2019 holiday patterns.\nOn Saturday, holiday travelers aiming to outsmart the usual traffic congestion by leaving Denver mid-afternoon were in for a rude awakening.\nElsewhere, CDOT on Saturday afternoon reopened the ramp from westbound C-470 to eastbound I-70 after a five-hour closure caused by a tractor-trailer rollover and another accident.\n\u201cLooks like anywhere from 3\u00bd to 6 inches\u201d of snow between Sunday night and Tuesday night, meteorologist Bob Koopmeiners said.\nWeather wasn\u2019t much of a factor, but travel in the high country Saturday was snarled just the same."}
