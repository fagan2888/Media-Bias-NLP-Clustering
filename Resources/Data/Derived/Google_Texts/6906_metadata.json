Rick Scott\u2019s administration and federal officials reached a tentative deal Tuesday over a $1 billion pot of hospital funding that derailed Florida\u2019s regular legislative session.\n\nScott administration officials traded barbs over the past few months with federal officials as they began following through with a phase-out of the Low Income Pool, or LIP, traditionally a mix of federal and local cash used by hospitals to provide indigent care.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe program was created in 2005 as part of an agreement with the federal government that allowed Florida to overhaul its Medicaid system. It lapsed, but was renewed in 2013. Federal officials announced last month that they were cutting the program from $2.1 to $1 billion next year, and reducing it to $608 million next year.\n\nThis year\u2019s cut blasted a $1 billion hole in the state budget, which necessitated a 20-day special legislative session to craft a state spending plan.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced Tuesday that it has reached a so-called \u201cagreement in principle\u201d with the state over a model that will dictate how that money flows to state hospitals. Among the stipulations is that the LIP funding can\u2019t be used to pay costs \u201cthat would be covered in a Medicaid expansion\u201d under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cCMS reached an agreement in principle with Florida on the size, duration, and distribution of funds of the state\u2019s Low Income Pool that reflects our best assessment of the appropriate contours for the Florida LIP,\u201d said C.M.S. press secretary Ben Wakana.\n\nThroughout the sometimes tense negotiations, Medicaid expansion played a starring role. At Scott\u2019s urging, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, a Republican, sued President Obama\u2019s administration after the state said federal officials were \u201clinking\u201d LIP funding with Florida\u2019s willingness to expand Medicaid.\n\nC.M.S. also required increased reimbursement rates paid to hospitals for providing care to Medicaid patients. The agency said low rates are becoming a hurdle for low-income patients to receive care.\n\n\u201cDuring the time LIP has been in existence, provider payment rates have been cut by 25 percent, continuing a trend the state started before LIP was created,\u201d wrote C.M.S. director Vikki Wachino, in a May letter announcing the LIP cuts.\n\nIn response, the state used $400 million in state funds to boost hospital rates, a move that drew down an additional $600 million in federal Medicaid funding. The $1 billion in LIP funding combined with the new rate money means the total pot of hospital indigent care funding sits at about $2 billion, roughly the same size as this year.\n\nWhen lawmakers return to Tallahassee next session, they will still have to approve a new LIP model to oversee hospital funding for 2016-17. Wachino said in her letter that next year\u2019s LIP funding will be distributed based on that new model and the amount of uncompensated care given by each provider.\n\nHouse Speaker Steve Crisafulli of Merritt Island said last week that with the shrinking of the LIP funding, hospitals will have to rework their revenue streams moving forward.\n\n\u201cHospitals have seen what the futures hold for them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will have to restructure their business models and know that Washington isn\u2019t going to be there for them anymore.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "'Agreement in principle' follows legislative battle over Low Income Pool.", "title": "Scott, feds reach deal on disputed hospital funding", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/rick-scott-low-income-pool-hospital-funding-119342.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/06/23/150623_rick_scott_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Steve Crisafulli,low income pool,Hospitals,Health Care,florida state budget,Centers For Medicare And Medicaid Services,Florida,Rick Scott,Medicaid", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "'Agreement in principle' follows legislative battle over Low Income Pool.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Rick Scott\u2019s administration and federal officials reached a tentative deal Tuesday over a $1 billion pot of hospital funding that derailed Florida\u2019s regular legislative session.\nHouse Speaker Steve Crisafulli of Merritt Island said last week that with the shrinking of the LIP funding, hospitals will have to rework their revenue streams moving forward.\nWhen lawmakers return to Tallahassee next session, they will still have to approve a new LIP model to oversee hospital funding for 2016-17.\nScott, feds reach deal on disputed hospital fundingTALLAHASSEE\u2014Gov.\nIn response, the state used $400 million in state funds to boost hospital rates, a move that drew down an additional $600 million in federal Medicaid funding."}
