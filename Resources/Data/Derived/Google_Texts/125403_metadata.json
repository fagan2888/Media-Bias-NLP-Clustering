Today, Denver continues to reflect the brash carelessness of the parvenu, flush and arrogant with sudden riches. In the frenetic drive to bigger, newer, faster, it\u2019s time to stop and consider the structures and places now silent, the storytellers of our history.\n\nRest in peace, historic buildings:\n\n\u2022 999 S. Broadway \u2014 The main factory buildings of the Gates Rubber Plant represent Denver\u2019s industrial history. Shuttered since 1991, the bulk of the sprawling site has been demolished and certified for redevelopment. The remaining, signature buildings are being demolished, despite the absence of a plan or developer to repurpose the site. In 2012, the Denver City Council and city administration accelerated the path to destruction, issuing Certificates of Non-Historic Status to London-based Tompkins PLC, the firm that acquired the family-based Gates Rubber Company in 1995.\n\nDenver\u2019s collective failure of imagination and political will spelled the destruction of this noble storyteller. A poorly informed City Council, a politically neutered Landmark Preservation Commission and a mayor infatuated with developers meekly ceded to an indifferent property owner. Proposals to repurpose the structures, spearheaded by savvy and experienced local and national developers, were dismissed. The buildings disappear, to be replaced by who knows what?\n\n\u2022 Designed by Denver\u2019s foremost Usonian-style architects, Victor Hornbein and Ed White, the Children\u2019s Psychiatric Day Care Center (1962) and the neighboring John F. Kennedy Childhood Development Center (1968) are two of the most important buildings on the former University of Colorado Medical Center\u2019s Eighth Avenue and Colorado Boulevard campus. These iconic examples of Denver mid-century architecture met the wrecking ball, although there is neither a developer nor a plan for the site. Chalk up another lost opportunity to the failure of patience and wisdom.\n\nAs for Denver\u2019s irreplaceable open space and public parkland, while last rites haven\u2019t yet been read, it appears the following are on life support:\n\n\u2022 Hentzell Park \u2014 The questionable swap between the city of Denver and Denver Public Schools of 9 acres of open space in southeast Denver for a building at 1330 Fox St. is on appeal. The Friends of Denver Parks, with the able support of attorney John Case, appealed District Court Judge Herbert Stern\u2019s June decision to approve the opaque transaction, denying the rights of Denver voters to agree. The Court of Appeals\u2019 expedited decision is due by year\u2019s end.\n\n\u2022 City Loop is a proposal to convert 13 acres in the northwest corner of City Park to a regional destination. Designed by Maine-based PORT Architecture, this loopy, multimillion-dollar scheme anticipates corporate sponsorship, promises to attract thousands of visitors and includes no plan for public safety, maintenance or parking. City Loop will offer a frenetic mix of kinetic amusements, skate parks, rain gardens, spiral slides and faux forests.\n\nCity Park hosts two of Denver\u2019s most active cultural assets \u2014 the Denver Zoo and the Denver Museum of Nature & Science. Can it sustain another, year-round regional attraction?\n\nInstant cities that don\u2019t mature and become sustainable disappear. This country\u2019s most famous: Tombstone.\n\nRIP.\n\nCivic activist Susan Barnes-Gelt can be reached at BarnesGelt@gmail. com or @SBGTweets.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Barnes-Gelt: RIP, historic places", "title": "Barnes-Gelt: RIP, historic places", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/11/21/barnes-gelt-rip-historic-places/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-21T18:02:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-21T18:02:31+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4254\"", "article_summary": "City Park hosts two of Denver\u2019s most active cultural assets \u2014 the Denver Zoo and the Denver Museum of Nature & Science.\n\u2022 City Loop is a proposal to convert 13 acres in the northwest corner of City Park to a regional destination.\nIn 2012, the Denver City Council and city administration accelerated the path to destruction, issuing Certificates of Non-Historic Status to London-based Tompkins PLC, the firm that acquired the family-based Gates Rubber Company in 1995.\nRest in peace, historic buildings:\u2022 999 S.
