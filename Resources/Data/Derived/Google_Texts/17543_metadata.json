In the shorthand version that has developed, some facts have been blurred.\n\nDavis was 21, not 19, when she was divorced. She lived only a few months in the family mobile home while separated from her husband before moving into an apartment with her daughter.\n\nA single mother working two jobs, she met Jeff Davis, a lawyer 13 years older than her, married him and had a second daughter. He paid for her last two years at Texas Christian University and her time at Harvard Law School, and kept their two daughters while she was in Boston. When they divorced in 2005, he was granted parental custody, and the girls stayed with him. Wendy Davis was directed to pay child support.\n\nIn an extensive interview last week, Davis acknowledged some chronological errors and incomplete details in what she and her aides have said about her life.\n\n\u201cMy language should be tighter,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m learning about using broader, looser language. I need to be more focused on the detail.\u201d\n\nAll campaigns seek to cast their candidate in the most positive light and their opponent in less flattering terms. Davis is presenting her story on websites, interviews, speeches and campaign videos. Last week, NBC\u2019s Today show became the latest media outlet to showcase the story of Davis\u2019 difficult early years in a flattering piece.\n\nUsing her story to inspire new voters, particularly women, youths and minorities, is a key part of the campaign\u2019s strategy to overcome the state\u2019s heavy Republican bent.\n\nBut likely Republican nominee Greg Abbott and his allies are expected to focus on different details to tell voters a competing story. Some will question how much of her success was her own doing, and how bad her circumstances were to start.\n\nDavis defended the accuracy of her overall account as a young single mother who escaped poverty, earned an education and built a successful legal and political career through hard work and determination.\n\n\u201cMost people would identify with the fact that we tend to be defined by the struggles we came through than by the successes. And certainly for me that\u2019s true,\u201d she said, sitting in her campaign office in Fort Worth. \u201cWhen I think about who I am and how it\u2019s reflected in the things I worked on, it comes from that place.\u201d\n\n\u2018Texas success story\u2019\n\nThe candidate\u2019s compelling life story begins with 14-year-old Wendy Russell working to help support her single mother in Tarrant County. While still a teenager, Davis married, had a child and divorced, she has said.\n\n\u201cI had a baby. I got divorced by the time I was 19 years old,\u201d she testified in a recent federal lawsuit over redistricting. \u201cAfter I got divorced, I lived in a mobile home park in southeast Fort Worth.\u201d\n\nAs a working mother raising a daughter, Davis enrolled in Tarrant County Community College.\n\n\u201cWith the help of academic scholarships and student loans, Wendy not only became the first person in her family to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree but graduated first in her class and was accepted to Harvard Law School,\u201d her website says.\n\nShe won a seat on the Fort Worth City Council and later moved to the Texas Senate. Last June, her 11-hour filibuster against abortion regulations made her a champion of women\u2019s health care and propelled her candidacy for governor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Texas success story,\u201d Davis told NBC. \u201cI am the epitome of hard work and optimism.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no question Davis struggled financially. When her parents separated, her father, Jerry Russell, started a sandwich shop and fledgling dinner theater.\n\n\u201cWhile he lived that passion, he never made money again and was never able to comply with the terms of my parents\u2019 divorce,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat it meant for us financially is that things ... completely turned upside down, and it was a real struggle. My brothers and I went to work young \u2014 and it was out of necessity, not about wanting to have a little bit of spending money.\u201d\n\nShe was 17 and still in high school when she moved in with her boyfriend, a construction worker named Frank Underwood. She got pregnant, married and \u201csome time between [age] 19 and 20 was when Frank and I separated,\u201d she said.\n\nDavis remained in the mobile home a few months, then moved in with her mother before getting her own apartment. She got custody of her daughter, Amber, and Underwood was ordered to pay child support.\n\nUnder terms of the divorce, he got a boat, the mobile home and the responsibility for the mortgage on it. She got a 3-year-old Pontiac Grand Prix, a 1972 Firebird and a 1967 Chevy pickup. Davis was 21.\n\nSecond chapters\n\nA few months later, she enrolled at the local community college. The idea came from a nurse at the pediatrician\u2019s office where she was working as a receptionist.\n\nFour nights a week, Davis was also waiting tables at her father\u2019s Fort Worth dinner theater, Stage West. It was there that she met her future husband, Jeff Davis, a 34-year-old friend of her father\u2019s.\n\n\u201cOne day at the end of a meeting, Jerry asked, \u2018How do you like younger women? My daughter wants to go out with you,\u2019\u201d Jeff Davis said in an interview. \u201cI was flattered so I took her out. We dated two or three years, then got married.\u201d\n\nWhile they dated, Wendy Davis enrolled at Texas Christian University on an academic scholarship and a Pell Grant. After they married, when she was 24, they moved into a historic home in the Mistletoe Heights neighborhood of Fort Worth.\n\nJeff Davis paid for her final two years at TCU. \u201cIt was community resources. We paid for it together,\u201d Wendy Davis said.\n\nWhen she was accepted to Harvard Law School, Jeff Davis cashed in his 401(k) account and eventually took out a loan to pay for her final year there.\n\n\u201cI was making really good money then, well over six figures,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you\u2019ve got someone at Harvard, you\u2019ve got bills to pay, you\u2019ve got two small kids. The economy itself was marginal. You do what you have to do, no big deal.\u201d\n\nThe daughters, then 8 and 2, remained with Jeff Davis in Fort Worth while Wendy Davis was at Harvard.\n\n\u201cHarvard really impressed her with a different culture of energy, really bright young people. That was something she would like to be around. She just enjoys that culture,\u201d Jeff Davis said.\n\nWendy Davis agreed. \u201cIt expanded my perspectives tremendously,\u201d she said. \u201cI went to school with some of the brightest people in the country, and I learned tremendously.\u201d\n\nPolitical player\n\nAfter she graduated from Harvard in 1993, Wendy Davis started her own law practice and worked with her husband at the title company he founded. They enrolled their younger daughter, Dru, at Fort Worth Country Day School, a prestigious private school.\n\nJeff Davis had once served on the Fort Worth City Council, and Wendy Davis expressed interest in running for a seat in 1996.\n\n\u201cI opened some doors for her with people, knew how bright she was and knew she\u2019d do a good job,\u201d he said.\n\nShe lost in 1996 but ran again two years later and won. The council seats were nonpartisan but in terms of voting, she was a Republican. Davis said she voted in GOP primaries because she supported mayor and congressional candidate Kay Granger, a Republican, and as a lawyer, she wanted to have a say in selecting judicial nominees in a county where the judges were often Republicans.\n\nOver time, the Davises\u2019 marriage was strained. In November 2003, Wendy Davis moved out.\n\nJeff Davis said that was right around the time the final payment on their Harvard Law School loan was due. \u201cIt was ironic,\u201d he said. \u201cI made the last payment, and it was the next day she left.\u201d\n\nWendy Davis said that as a lawyer, she contributed too.\n\n\u201cI was a vibrant part of contributing to our family finances from the time I graduated to the time we separated in 2003,\u201d she said. \u201cThe idea that suddenly there was this instantaneous departure after Jeff had partnered so beautifully with me in putting me through school is just absurd.\u201d\n\nIn his initial divorce filing, Jeff Davis said the marriage had failed, citing adultery on her part and conflicts that the couple could not overcome. The final court decree makes no mention of infidelity, granting the divorce solely \u201con the ground of insupportability.\u201d\n\nAmber was 21 and in college. Dru was in ninth grade. Jeff Davis was awarded parental custody. Wendy Davis was ordered to pay $1,200 a month in child support.\n\n\u201cShe did the right thing,\u201d he said. \u201cShe said, \u2018I think you\u2019re right; you\u2019ll make a good, nurturing father. While I\u2019ve been a good mother, it\u2019s not a good time for me right now.\u2019\u201d\n\nWendy Davis declined to discuss the circumstances or terms of the divorce.\n\n\u201cWhen I decided to run for governor, I promised my girls we would not revisit a time that was terribly difficult for them,\u201d she said. \u201cI will tell you it was very important to me that Dru stay in her childhood home. It was a very difficult time in our life.\u201d\n\nShe said: \u201cI very willingly, as part of my divorce settlement, paid child support. That was at my request, not any court telling me I needed to financially support my daughters.\u201d\n\nA former colleague and political supporter who worked closely with Davis when she was on the council said the body\u2019s work was very time-consuming.\n\n\u201cWendy is tremendously ambitious,\u201d he said, speaking only on condition of anonymity in order to give what he called an honest assessment. \u201cShe\u2019s not going to let family or raising children or anything else get in her way.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cShe\u2019s going to find a way, and she\u2019s going to figure out a way to spin herself in a way that grabs at the heart strings. A lot of it isn\u2019t true about her, but that\u2019s just us who knew her. But she\u2019d be a good governor.\u201d\n\nDavis\u2019 daughters, now adults, are supporting their mother\u2019s campaign for governor. Both appear in a campaign video on her behalf.\n\nJeff Davis said the financial difficulties that Wendy Davis faced before her second marriage were real.\n\n\u201cA lot of what she says is true,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen she was 21, it became a little easier for her. The first 21 years were about working one, two and three jobs, trying to get through, raising a kid, driving an old Toyota pickup truck that was the smallest you could find.\n\n\u201cShe got a break,\u201d Jeff Davis said. \u201cGood things happen, opportunities open up. You take them; you get lucky. That\u2019s a better narrative than what they\u2019re trying to paint.\u201d\n\nFollow Wayne Slater on Twitter at @wayneslater.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The basic elements of the narrative are true, but the full story of her life is more complicated, as often happens when public figures aim to define themselves.", "og": {"description": "The basic elements of the narrative are true, but the full story of her life is more complicated, as often happens when public figures aim to define themselves.", "title": "As Wendy Davis touts life story in race for governor, key facts blurred", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20140118-as-wendy-davis-touts-life-story-in-race-for-governor-key-facts-blurred.ece", "image": {"width": 670, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20140118-lede_filibusterad.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/lede_filibusterAD.jpg", "height": 472}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-01-23T16:55:56Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-01-19T04:34:27Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"As Wendy Davis touts life story in race for governor, key facts blurred\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20140118-as-wendy-davis-touts-life-story-in-race-for-governor-key-facts-blurred.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20140118-lede_filibusterad.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/lede_filibusterAD.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1391938\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-01-19T04:34:27Z\", \"section\": \"Politics Headlines\", \"author\": \"WAYNE SLATER\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20140118-lede_filibusterad.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/lede_filibusterAD.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-01-19T04:34:27Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca50b\"", "article_summary": "Jeff Davis said the financial difficulties that Wendy Davis faced before her second marriage were real.\nJeff Davis had once served on the Fort Worth City Council, and Wendy Davis expressed interest in running for a seat in 1996.\nFORT WORTH \u2014 Wendy Davis has made her personal story of struggle and success a centerpiece of her campaign to become the first Democrat elected governor of Texas in almost a quarter-century.\nWendy Davis agreed.\nYou do what you have to do, no big deal.\u201dThe daughters, then 8 and 2, remained with Jeff Davis in Fort Worth while Wendy Davis was at Harvard."}
