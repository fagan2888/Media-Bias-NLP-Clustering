One of those we\u2019re already seeing in the form of higher insurance premiums. Another is lackluster care at the doctor\u2019s office, a problem a new report says will worsen in the ensuing years as the physician shortage hits the tens of thousands.\n\nA study commissioned by The Association of American Medical Colleges found \u201cUnder every combination of scenarios modeled, the United States will face a shortage of physicians over the next decade\u2026 The projections show a shortage ranging between 61,700 and 94,700, with a significant shortage showing among many surgical specialties.\u201d\n\nThe saddest part is we were warned. As the Investor\u2019s Business Daily editorial board writes, \u201cThe folks who forced ObamaCare on us said this shortage wouldn\u2019t happen. In fact, they told us that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act would \u2018expand the number of primary-care doctors, nurses, and physician assistants.\u2019 We knew better, though. In 2009 we commissioned a poll that told us just the opposite: Hundreds of thousands \u2014 45% of those surveyed \u2014 said that if ObamaCare became law, they would shut down their practices or retire early.\u201d\n\nA bloated market, reduced incentives, a heavier workload minus the pay, high tax rates and unjustified malpractice lawsuits are all contributors. But, Investor\u2019s says, \u201cDriving the shortage is ObamaCare\u2019s attempt to expand access to health care. The increased demand to see a doctor is outstripping the supply of physicians. With so many new patients, the medical colleges can\u2019t produce enough doctors to keep up.\u201d\n\nYou simply cannot throw millions of people into the health care system without consequences. That\u2019s not to say that some people shouldn\u2019t have access to health care. But it is to say that a one size fits all approach was the wrong solution \u2014 and now we\u2019re suffering for it. It\u2019s fairly remarkable how many of America\u2019s problems today could be solved by understanding basic economics. The system needs reform. We can start by requiring every lawmaker to take a prerequisite course on the law of supply and demand.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The shortage of doctors in America will soon hit the tens of thousands.", "csrf-token": "uXJPaenB+J5ZykTVQpRwfGk7V71Id8c+xFXMn90KktU=", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The Patriot Post", "description": "The shortage of doctors in America will soon hit the tens of thousands.", "title": "Major Doctor Shortage Looms", "url": "http://patriotpost.us/posts/41762", "image": "http://assets.patriotpost.us/images/2016-04-06-f79ef94f.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002378661032, "app_id": 217327155053459}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Right Hooks Major Doctor Shortage LoomsWhen Democrats were getting ready to pass ObamaCare, conservatives vehemently warned about the side effects that would accompany it.\nBut, Investor\u2019s says, \u201cDriving the shortage is ObamaCare\u2019s attempt to expand access to health care.\nWith so many new patients, the medical colleges can\u2019t produce enough doctors to keep up.\u201dYou simply cannot throw millions of people into the health care system without consequences.\nAs the Investor\u2019s Business Daily editorial board writes, \u201cThe folks who forced ObamaCare on us said this shortage wouldn\u2019t happen.\nThat\u2019s not to say that some people shouldn\u2019t have access to health care."}
