The federally facilitated marketplace previously didn't do that, she said.\n\nFiling Requirements for Subsidy Recipients\n\nThe ACA requires recipients of subsidies to file tax returns the year after they receive them to verify that their incomes make them eligible for the subsidies. If the recipients made more than was originally claimed, they are liable to pay back excess subsidies, and if they made less, they are eligible to receive more subsidies.\n\nRoughly $1.7 billion in premium assistance payments were made in 2014 for 430,000 HealthCare.gov applicants who were approved despite problems verifying eligibility, leaving the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services vulnerable to potential fraud, according to a Government Accountability Office report released Feb. 24 (37 HCDR, 2/25/16).\n\nOn Jan. 8, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen wrote members of Congress saying that for the 2015 filing season about 1.5 million taxpayers who needed to file tax returns to reconcile their APTCs hadn't done so, and the taxpayers who had filed returns reported receiving $11.3 billion in APTCs of the approximately $15.5 billion the marketplaces paid out in 2014.\n\nThe guidance describes the process by which current enrollees are notified about the upcoming open enrollment period and how ongoing eligibility and enrollment are handled for current enrollees, \u201cincluding those who choose not to return to the Marketplace by the deadline to select a plan for the upcoming year,\u201d the HHS said. Open enrollment for 2017 will be held from Nov. 1 to Jan. 31, 2017.\n\nContinuity of Coverage\n\nDespite measures to ensure enrollees update their eligibility information, an HHS official who asked not to be identified told Bloomberg BNA in an e-mail May 10, \u201cConsistent with procedures for benefit years 2015 and 2016, the procedures for 2017 maintain the commitment to preserve continuity of coverage while limiting the burden for enrollees.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsumers who take no action will generally be re-enrolled in coverage\u201d by the federally facilitated marketplace \u201cusing the most recent income information available,\u201d the official said.\n\nAs in coverage years 2015 and 2016, prior to open enrollment, most current enrollees will receive a marketplace open enrollment notice under the 2017 guidance.\n\nThe most recent income information available to redetermine eligibility for financial assistance and recalculate advance payments of the premium tax credits and income-based cost-sharing reductions will be used, the guidance said.\n\nExpanded Information From IRS\n\nIn addition to the new requirement that eligibility information be updated in order to get coverage on Jan. 1, 2017, beginning in September the Internal Revenue Service will expand the data it provides to the federally facilitated marketplace to include people who didn't file tax returns or who filed tax returns but didn't reconcile their APTCs using Form 8962, the guidance said.\n\nAnother difference in the new guidance, Ahn said, is for 2017 coverage enrollees can contact the federally facilitated marketplace by Dec. 15 for coverage starting Jan. 1, 2017, to update their information, even if they didn't file a tax return.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Sara Hansard in Washington at shansard@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Kendra Casey Plank at kcasey@bna.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/hhs-issues-2017-n57982071491/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "ACA health insurance subsidies will be discontinued for people who don't file tax returns under\u00a0guidance\u00a0issued May 10 by the...", "title": "HHS Issues 2017 Insurance Marketplace Guidance"}, "csrf-token": "Rh3bZdLWS0L4qv050_cT4TV3yEK58WBOYOwOZ0s-pzNKi9Wj_JMFqr1JWuekyPtx18LDG3xSTmxC_kyaUXvsuRI9cLhOQqThPUVVsT-5zIE1:XuVpjXc9G7QdlerfH1Ypwcj_NMRfzBgJ_iIEV4RTY4UVP8z4uzdaCEUw8kgnsDDRLusX8TginBF5RD0QLXfgcAu3hQaSBHbbkJBF057oazo1", "description": "ACA health insurance subsidies will be discontinued for people who don't file tax returns under\u00a0guidance\u00a0issued May 10 by the", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fragment": "!"}, "article_summary": "By Sara HansardMay 10 \u2014 ACA health insurance subsidies will be discontinued for people who don't file tax returns under guidance issued May 10 by the HHS.\nAs in coverage years 2015 and 2016, prior to open enrollment, most current enrollees will receive a marketplace open enrollment notice under the 2017 guidance.\nAnother difference in the new guidance, Ahn said, is for 2017 coverage enrollees can contact the federally facilitated marketplace by Dec. 15 for coverage starting Jan. 1, 2017, to update their information, even if they didn't file a tax return.\nOpen enrollment for 2017 will be held from Nov. 1 to Jan. 31, 2017.\nFiling Requirements for Subsidy RecipientsThe ACA requires recipients of subsidies to file tax returns the year after they receive them to verify that their incomes make them eligible for the subsidies."}
