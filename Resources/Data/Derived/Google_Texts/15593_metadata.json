But finding anyone who\u2019s actually received or even seen such a gift is another matter.\n\nIn Badiraguato, the small mountain town that is part of Guzman\u2019s rags-to-crime-riches mythology, none of the two dozen people interviewed by The Associated Press could point out evidence of his legendary largesse.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a single building producing jobs, a single piece of public works, a soccer field, a sewer, a school, water systems, a clinic or hospital, not a single one that you can say was built by drug traffickers or their money,\u201d Mayor Mario Valenzuela said.\n\nIf Guzman or his cartel had invested in their hometowns, he said, \u201cthey\u2019d look different; they would have paved roads or drainage systems, but they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nGuzman\u2019s July 11 escape from a prison near Mexico City has focused attention again on Badiraguato, the county seat of a township that includes the hamlet of La Tuna, where El Chapo\u2019s mother still lives.\n\nThe roads to La Tuna are still washed-out dirt tracks, and Badiraguato itself has none of the flashy accoutrements of money \u2014 palatial mausoleums and fancy, gated communities of new homes \u2014 that are abundant in Culiacan, the state capital.\n\nTucked into the foothills where the coastal stretches of flat corn and tomato fields meet the imposing mountains of the Sierra Madre, Badiraguato remains mired in poverty, Valenzuela acknowledges that many of the township\u2019s residents make a living growing marijuana or opium poppies.\n\nGuzman grew up here, the son of a poor farmer. His rise as a crime boss has been surrounded by mythology, a Hollywood version of an old-school Mafioso \u2014 ruthless yet honorable. Songs have been written in his honor, and some locals extol him as a Robin Hood-type figure who is careful to leave innocents out of his deadly score-settlings.\n\n\u201cChapo Guzman isn\u2019t violent,\u201d Valenzuela said about a man accused of hundreds of murders. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t shoot it out with the government.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s unlike the reputation of the Jalisco New Generation cartel to the south, which is alleged to have brought down a military helicopter May 1 with a rocket-propelled missile. Or the Zetas, who have fueled their notoriety in central Mexico with grisly beheadings and the hanging of bodies across public highways. Or Guerreros Unidos, the cartel alleged to have killed 43 college students last fall.\n\nFor many who live in the state that gives name to Guzman\u2019s Sinaloa cartel, he is seen as a lesser evil.\n\nBadiraguato is not immune to violence. The township of 30,000 reports a homicide rate at least five times the national average.\n\nViolence, threats and fear in Sinaloa have displaced poor farming families, with hundreds fleeing the mountainous township of Sinaloa de Leyva during the past five years. Dozens of families left the village of Ocurahui after drug gangs, particularly the Sinaloa cartel, pressured farmers to plant opium poppies to counter falling prices for marijuana. Residents who didn\u2019t want to grow drug crops faced kidnappings or even death.\n\nYet, the mythology surrounding Guzman lives on.\n\nLucero Uriarte, a high-school student in Badiraguato, said of the drug lord: \u201cHe has helped a lot of people \u2014 more than anyone else, the poor \u2014 because he knows what they\u2019re going through.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman praised as a benefactor", "title": "Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman praised as a benefactor", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/25/joaquin-el-chapo-guzman-praised-as-a-benefactor/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150725__20150726_A15_ND26DRUGLORDTOWNp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150725__20150726_A15_ND26DRUGLORDTOWNp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-25T18:28:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T15:06:57+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2ab6\"", "article_summary": "For many who live in the state that gives name to Guzman\u2019s Sinaloa cartel, he is seen as a lesser evil.\nBADIRAGUATO, Mexico \u2014 People living in the hometown of drug lord Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman have heard stories of his benevolence: gifts of medicine for the poor, deliveries of drinking water to storm-stricken towns.\n\u201cChapo Guzman isn\u2019t violent,\u201d Valenzuela said about a man accused of hundreds of murders.\nDozens of families left the village of Ocurahui after drug gangs, particularly the Sinaloa cartel, pressured farmers to plant opium poppies to counter falling prices for marijuana.\nYet, the mythology surrounding Guzman lives on."}
