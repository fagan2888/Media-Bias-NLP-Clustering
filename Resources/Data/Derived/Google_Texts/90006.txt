Heisenberg returned to the small screen tonight with a shout-out to the epic “Say My Name” episode from season five of “Breaking Bad.” Clad in his cooking suit and goggles, Walter White tries to pass himself off as a “sort-of” pharmacist in the second of two commercials for Esurance (the first featured Lindsay Lohan mocking her own DUI record and, perhaps, her sexual history).

A customer tries to pick up a called-in prescription, but notes that White isn’t Greg, the pharmacy tech. “I’m sorta Greg,” he replies. “We’re both over 50 years old, we both used to own a Pontiac Aztec, we both have a lot of experience with drugs … pharmaceuticals. So, say my name.”
