Spotlight on… Ben Roethlisberger, quarterback, Steelers

When: 6:30 p.m. Sunday vs. the Baltimore Ravens at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh.

What’s up: Big Ben is way up after he threw for an astonishing 522 yards — six touchdown passes and no interceptions — while outdueling Andrew Luck in a 51-34 win last week. That came against the Colts, who shut out the Bengals 27-0 the previous week.

Background: Roethlisberger was a huge winner early in his NFL career, going 13-0 as a rookie, then leading the Steelers past the Broncos in the AFC championship game in Denver and Super Bowl title in his second season (2005). Big Ben won two Super Bowls in his first five seasons, then played in a third to cap his seventh season (2010). But his Steelers haven’t won a playoff game since the 2010 AFC championship game against the Jets — and they have gone only 8-8 and 8-8 each of the past two seasons.

Klis’ take: This game against the Ravens will determine whether Roethlisberger and the Steelers are back to playoff caliber again. Big Ben started 4-0 against Ravens QB Joe Flacco in head-to-head meetings but since has gone 1-4, including a 26-6 loss in Week 2. Now 32, Roethlisberger is within range of having a Hall of Fame career. The only QBs with at least two Super Bowl appearances not in the Hall of Fame are Jim Plunkett, Craig Morton and Joe Theismann. Plunkett is the only QB with two Super Bowl wins not in the Hall (the Giants’ Eli Manning may join him). All QBs with at least three Super Bowl appearances have been immortalized except Kurt Warner, who is eligible for the first time. If Big Ben wins one more Super Bowl in the next five years, he’s a first-ballot Hall of Famer, while the two quarterbacks drafted ahead of him in 2004 — Manning and Philip Rivers — might fall short.
