The ride\u2014on the train, on the subway, on the bus\u2014may be full of familiar strangers; politeness and pragmatism, however, tend to emphasize the \"stranger\" over the familiar. Why interact with other people when you can, for the good of all aboard, ignore them?\n\nBut what happens when those mandates gets reversed\u2014when the stranger on the subway becomes, actually, a little too familiar? Since early 2012, the artist and sculptor George Ferrandi has been exploring that idea through her project \"it felt like i knew you\u2026,\" a series of time-lapse images that capture what happens when the anonymity of the city commute gets replaced, determinedly, with intimacy.\n\nWhat happens when the familiar stranger becomes, actually, a little too familiar?\n\nIt goes like this: Ferrandi rides the New York City subway\u2014and \"falls asleep\" on fellow passengers. Her collaborator Angela Gilland, strategically situated across the aisle, shoots video of the scene that ensues.\n\nThe point of this exercise isn't just to capture delightful/revealing stills of personal space invaded (although, awesomely, it does that). It's also to explore what \"personal space\" means in the first place\u2014especially on public transportation, which not only carves the idea of individualized spaces into its layouts, but which also adapts its assumptions about those spaces according to other technologies. Ferrandi wanted to see what happens, essentially, when one of the most intimate things in the world\u2014sleeping in front of someone else\u2014meets the most public of settings.", "article_metadata": {"description": "To sleep, perchance to freak out some fellow commuters ...", "author": "Megan Garber", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "To sleep, perchance to freak out some fellow commuters ...", "title": "How New Yorkers Reacted When a Stranger Slept on Them in the Subway", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/11/ferrandi_thumb/lead_large.png", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/11/how-new-yorkers-reacted-when-a-stranger-slept-on-them-in-the-subway/281806/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca62a\"", "article_summary": "Of the many unspoken codes of public transportation, perhaps the most crucial is this: Keep, as much as possible, to yourself.\nThe point of this exercise isn't just to capture delightful/revealing stills of personal space invaded (although, awesomely, it does that).\nBut what happens when those mandates gets reversed\u2014when the stranger on the subway becomes, actually, a little too familiar?\nWhat happens when the familiar stranger becomes, actually, a little too familiar?\nThe ride\u2014on the train, on the subway, on the bus\u2014may be full of familiar strangers; politeness and pragmatism, however, tend to emphasize the \"stranger\" over the familiar."}
