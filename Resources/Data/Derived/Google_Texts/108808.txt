Wal-Mart Stores Inc. will raise its base salaries at 1,434 stores to comply with minimum wage hikes that will go into effect in 21 states beginning Jan. 1, 2015.

The new laws have prompted Wal-Mart to adjust the minimum premium paid to its higher-skilled employees and combine its lowest three pay grades, Reuters reported Wednesday.

“Essentially that wage compression at the upper level of the hourly associate is going to help absorb that cost of the wage increase at the lower level,” a Wal-Mart manager told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
