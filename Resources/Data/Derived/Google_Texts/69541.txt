As the headline indicates in slightly exaggerated fashion, Stephen Colbert‘s send-off from The Colbert Report was full of so many celebrity and political cameos that it was difficult to keep track without curling up in a ball and rocking back and forth.

Colbert bid farewell to his audience by singing “We’ll Meet Again,” with Jon Stewart joining him by a piano manned by Randy Newman. Oh, but the cameos didn’t end there.

There was Willie Nelson, Doris Kearns Goodwin, James Franco, Arianna Huffington, Jeff Daniels, Keith Olbermann, Samantha Power, Andrew Sullivan, Katie Couric, among others.

Oh, and, wow, even Mike Huckabee, Grover Norquist, Bill Clinton, and Henry Kissinger, among… others. And, naturally, Big Bird and the rest of the Sesame Street gang was there.
