However, Vice President Joe Biden and other senior White House staffers \u201cwere kept up to speed,\u201d Earnest said.\n\nThe doctor\u2019s visit was not on the White House schedule for Saturday and reporters hustled to join the president\u2019s motorcade to Water Reed in Bethesda, Maryland. The president left the hospital 28 minutes after arriving.\n\nDr. Ronny L. Jackson, Obama\u2019s physician, issued a statement:\n\n\u201cThis morning, an ear, nose and throat specialist from Fort Belvoir Medical Center conducted a fiber optic exam, under my supervision, of the President\u2019s throat based on symptoms of sore throat over the past couple weeks. The exam revealed soft tissue swelling in the posterior throat and I, in consultation with the specialist, determined that further evaluation with a routine CT scan was prudent.\n\n\u201cThe CT scan was conducted this afternoon purely as a matter of convenience for the President\u2019s schedule. The CT scan was normal. The President\u2019s symptoms are consistent with soft tissue inflammation related to acid reflux and will be treated accordingly.\u201d\n\nCNN chief medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta said acid reflux usually can be easily treated.\n\n\u201cA lot of times, it may just be dietary changes,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes, you want to give medicines to reduce the amount of acid in the stomach.\u201d\n\nGupta said he thought the CT scan was done \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey brought in an ears, nose and throat doctor into the White House and placed a scope down the mouth and looking at the back of throat to see what was causing his discomfort,\u201d he said. \u201cTypically, you just do that by sort of putting an anesthetic spray in the back of the throat, sometimes a sedation as well. \u2026 Based on what they found there, they were concerned enough to go ahead and get a CT scan.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the President is still smoking, Earnest replied that Obama quit with the assistance of nicotine gum.\n\nObama visited Jackson for his periodic checkup in May. Jackson described Obama\u2019s overall health as \u201cexcellent.\u201d\n\nThe checkup information, released in June, was the third medical report released by the White House during Obama\u2019s presidency.", "article_metadata": {"description": "(CNN) -- President Barack Obama underwent a routine CT scan Saturday afternoon while visiting Walter Reed National Military Medical Center because of a sore throat, according to the White House and his doctor.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "6234caa106890daf4037e63d88245e14"}, "og": {"site_name": "FOX6Now.com", "description": "(CNN) \u2014 President Barack Obama underwent a routine CT scan Saturday afternoon while visiting Walter Reed National Military Medical Center because of a sore throat, according to the White Hous\u2026", "title": "President Obama receiving treatment for acid reflux after visiting doctor for sore throat", "url": "http://fox6now.com/2014/12/07/president-obama-receiving-treatment-for-acid-reflux-after-visiting-doctor-for-sore-throat/", "image": {"width": 770, "identifier": "https://localtvwiti.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/president-barack-obama.jpg", "height": 433}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvwiti.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/president-barack-obama.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@fox6now", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@fox6now"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=334682375", "fb": {"pages": 7010901522}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://fox6now.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/6c174f1af90d3de8afc154eb8bcd6c4a?s=16", "application-name": "FOX6Now.com", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/fox6news", "published_time": "2014-12-07T13:39:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-07T13:39:21+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/fox6news"}, "keywords": "news, barack obama", "google-site-verification": "iXLB9DCJ8o44w3SHddEhtmvCXRUfxQCVRXXMHkyL6jI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "(CNN) \u2014 President Barack Obama underwent a routine CT scan Saturday afternoon while visiting Walter Reed National Military Medical Center because of a sore throat, according to the White House and his doctor.\nHowever, Vice President Joe Biden and other senior White House staffers \u201cwere kept up to speed,\u201d Earnest said.\n\u201cThe CT scan was conducted this afternoon purely as a matter of convenience for the President\u2019s schedule.\nThe CT scan was normal.\nJackson described Obama\u2019s overall health as \u201cexcellent.\u201dThe checkup information, released in June, was the third medical report released by the White House during Obama\u2019s presidency."}
