Apparently, when that country is Mexico.\n\nSince the start of the year, the U.S.'s neighbor to the South has seen its peso sink to historical lows \u2014 prompting the hasty intervention of Mexico's policymakers to smooth out the volatility.\n\nThe currency's faltering fortunes have tracked other battered emerging market (EM) currencies hit by the global commodities downturn, yet the peso has still largely fared better than other EM currencies. The MSCI Mexico Index has outperformed the broader MSCI EM Index by 12 percent in local currency terms since October 2014, according to data from investment advisory firm DDCapital. That was at a time when the peso slumped nearly 30 percent against the dollar.\n\nEconomists say the peso has been adjusting to lower oil prices \u2014 which have recovered to near $40 per barrel but are still down nearly 40 percent year over year \u2014 and a stronger U.S. dollar. The Dollar Index, a broad measure of the greenback's value against a basket of trading partners, has retreated by about 4 percent this quarter, allowing Mexico's currency to claw back from the brink of a record low near 20 pesos per $1.\n\nYet unlike the consternation that normally accompanies a slumping currency, Mexico's trading partners have been silent.\n\nAs the peso's slide picked up speed earlier this year, the U.S.-Mexico's trade deficit widened to more than $4 billion, Census Bureau data shows, compared to nearly $3 billion in December 2015. That imbalance has helped feed a new sense of American trade protectionism, boosting populist candidates like GOP frontrunner Donald Trump.\n\nHowever, analysts aren't convinced \u2014 at least for the time being \u2014 the peso's slide is creating a trade advantage that would be considered a salvo in the \"currency wars\" of which economies like Japan and China normally stand accused. For now, domestic price inflation appears contained as well.\n\n\"This isn't really courting trouble,\" said Eduardo Suarez, Mexico City-based co-head of Latin America strategy with ScotiaBank. Citing the charged rhetoric of the 2016 race for the White House, Suarez dismissed the idea that Mexico had an unfair advantage when compared to its NAFTA trading partner.\n\n\n\n\"Some populist politicians are arguing Mexico plays unfairly, but the argument is nonsensical,\" Suarez said. \"Mexico has spent the past few years selling USD to support the peso and has never really participated in any currency wars,\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Mexico has seen its currency bounce from record lows against the dollar, but for now nobody's all that worried about the move.", "author": "Dawn Kissi", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Mexico has seen its currency bounce from record lows against the dollar, but for now nobody's all that worried.", "title": "Why Mexico's peso isn't the latest currency war", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/01/mexican-peso-no-worry-for-the-world.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/04/01/103514410-GettyImages-482214824.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mexico has seen its currency bounce from record lows against the dollar, but for now nobody's all that worried.", "title": "Weak peso?
