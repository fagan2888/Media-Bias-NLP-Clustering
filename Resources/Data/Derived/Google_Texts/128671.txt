A 19-year-old Kansas City man accused of trying to kill a Wyandotte County deputy has been sentenced on an unrelated robbery charge.

Charles Bowser is one of three men charged with shooting Deputy Scott Wood during a convenience store robbery last March in Kansas City, Kansas.

The Kansas City Star reports that two other men were found convicted earlier this month of attempted capital murder in Wood's shooting. Bowser is set for trial in May in that case.

Bowser was sentenced Friday to 10 years in prison for a January 2015 home invasion robbery. A jury found him guilty in December of aggravated robbery, aggravated burglary and criminal possession of a firearm.
