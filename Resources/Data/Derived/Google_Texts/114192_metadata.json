He was never goaded into angry responses to insults by others who criticized him for tattoos or body piercings, she said.\n\nNathan\u2019s full-time job wasn\u2019t delivering pizzas \u2014 he was a junior library assistant at IBM in Boulder. He took the part-time job because he wanted to be self-sufficient. He never missed a day of work even when it meant only getting an hour of sleep, Katie said.\n\n\u201cHe was my big cheese! He was my life,\u201d she said. \u201cI want everyone to know that he was a loving man and that the man who killed him was a monster.\u201d\n\nNathan\u2019s parents, John Leon and Cynthia Jones, who were divorced when he was young, both maintained close daily or weekly contact with their son.\n\nJohn Leon was proud of the way that Nate \u2014 a week before his murder \u2014 was unfazed by his daughter\u2019s sobbing and screaming at the end of a long day at the Children\u2019s Museum of Denver.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t have an important job. He wasn\u2019t important to the community. He didn\u2019t have great ambitions,\u201d John Leon said. \u201cHe was an amazing father.\u201d\n\nNathan, a musician, could execute the perfect electric guitar riff. He shared his father\u2019s love of computer and mechanical gadgetry and of roller coasters \u2014 the latter of which would dictate where the family took cross-country trips. Nathan once cut his Toyota in half and rebuilt it completely. With aspirations of becoming a crime-scene analyst or a psychologist, he was planning to go to college.\n\n\u201cHe was my role model. He was a different kind of a man,\u201d his father said. \u201cHe would always see good in people. He never raised his voice. Never.\u201d\n\nKatie has explained his absence to their confused daughters by telling them he is their angel \u2014 all the while dreading the day she must explain how and why he died. Their twin 5-year-olds \u2014 Irelynn and Scotlyn, for their heritage \u2014 have trouble sleeping and eating and are in therapy. Kaydance, Katie\u2019s stepdaughter, is 7.\n\nKatie stays strong for the kids, but every Sunday over the past year she is drawn to the desolate mountainside turnout where her husband\u2019s body was found a year ago.\n\nEvery Sunday, Katie brings fresh flowers to the site to meditate, remember and talk. Usually, she is alone or with her mother, but those times when her daughters are there, she tells them they are visiting the location where \u201cDaddy became an angel.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ask him to watch over his three little girls: Keep them safe,\u201d Katie said.\n\nKatie said she wishes Ebel hadn\u2019t taken the \u201cchicken way out\u201d by triggering a confrontation \u2014 a shootout with police in Texas \u2014 that led to his death.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re never going to be able to tell him he\u2019s destroyed our family,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Widow: Nathan Leon wasn\u2019t a pizza driver, he was \u201cmy life\u201d", "title": "Widow: Nathan Leon wasn\u2019t a pizza driver, he was \u201cmy life\u201d", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/15/widow-nathan-leon-wasnt-a-pizza-driver-he-was-my-life/", "image": {"width": 480, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140315__20140316_A17_cd16clementsleon2p1.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140315__20140316_A17_cd16clementsleon2p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-15T18:41:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T14:56:16+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe192f\"", "article_summary": "Nathan\u2019s full-time job wasn\u2019t delivering pizzas \u2014 he was a junior library assistant at IBM in Boulder.\nHe never missed a day of work even when it meant only getting an hour of sleep, Katie said.\nHe was never goaded into angry responses to insults by others who criticized him for tattoos or body piercings, she said.\nKatie said she wishes Ebel hadn\u2019t taken the \u201cchicken way out\u201d by triggering a confrontation \u2014 a shootout with police in Texas \u2014 that led to his death.\nBecause of his enthusiasm, discussions about nothing in particular never seemed mundane, Katie said."}
