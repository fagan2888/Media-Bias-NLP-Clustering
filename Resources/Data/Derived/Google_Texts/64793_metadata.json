He took photos of Denali \u2014 the former Mt. McKinley \u2014 through the windows of Air Force One and shared them via Instagram. He used melting glaciers as a backdrop to talk about climate change, posed with small children and large fish, and became the first sitting president to venture north of the Arctic Circle.\n\nHe seemed to smile throughout the trip, and why not? The nuclear agreement that Secretary of State John Kerry negotiated with Iran is now safe from congressional meddling. U.S. economic growth for the second quarter was a healthy 3.7 percent. Unemployment has fallen to 5.1 percent, according to figures released Friday. Saudi King Salman \u2014 portrayed by Obama\u2019s critics as peeved with the president \u2014 dropped by the White House on Friday for a chat, reportedly renting an entire luxury hotel for his entourage. And later this month, Chinese President Xi Jinping is scheduled to arrive for what promises to be the most important state visit of the year.\n\nObama gives the impression of having rediscovered the joy of being president. Maybe he really needed that Martha\u2019s Vineyard vacation. Or maybe he is beginning to see some of his long-term policies finally bearing fruit \u2014 and his legacy being cemented.\n\nWatching him now is a useful reminder that there is no such thing as the \u201ctwilight\u201d of a presidency. Until the day his successor takes office, Obama will be the leading actor on the biggest and most important stage in the world.\n\nIt is useful to recall that George W. Bush practically had one foot out the door when the financial system threatened to collapse in 2008. It was Bush and his advisers who put together a massive $700 billion bank bailout and managed to sell it to Congress. Bush signed the rescue bill into law on Oct. 3 \u2014 barely a month before his successor would be chosen.\n\nThe banks were saved, but nothing could stop the economy from falling into its worst slump since the Great Depression. I believe historians will conclude that one of Obama\u2019s greatest accomplishments was bringing the economy back to real growth and something close to full employment \u2014 more slowly than Americans may have wished, perhaps, but steadily.\n\nThe Iran deal, in my view, is another remarkable achievement.\n\nObama\u2019s White House has often been clumsy at inside-the-Beltway politics, but the handling of the Iran deal has been adroit. The drip-drip-drip of announcements from Democratic senators who favor the agreement has created a sense of momentum and inevitability\n\nAll is not sweetness and light, of course. The Syrian civil war is a humanitarian disaster of enormous and tragic proportions, as evidenced by the heartbreaking refugee crisis in Europe. I don\u2019t believe there is anything the United States could have done to prevent the war, but all nations bear a responsibility to help ease the suffering.\n\nDomestically, the good economic numbers ignore the fact that middle-class incomes remain stagnant. Even without healthy wage growth, an economic recovery feels better than a slump \u2014 but only in relative terms.\n\nAll in all, though, it looks like a good time to be President Obama. The Affordable Care Act, as he had hoped, is by now so well-established that no Republican successor could easily eliminate it.\n\nObama\u2019s legacy will have a few blemishes. But he has good reason to smile.\n\neugenerobinson@washpost.com", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "Saudi King Salman \u2014 portrayed by Obama\u2019s critics as peeved with the president \u2014 dropped by the White House on Friday for a chat, reportedly renting an entire luxury hotel for his entourage.
