After following Thompson out of the store, Lt. Serio confronted him and the subject was seen pulling a shiny silver object from his waistband. Serio drew his weapon and fired at least four shots, all missing Thompson.

Lt. Serio gave Thompson orders to lay down on the ground in the prone position, and he did just that and was arrested.

Later, a cell phone was recovered and police think that it was the phone that was the object Thompson had pulled from his waistband.

During the investigation, Thompson confessed to detectives that he wanted Serio to shoot him in an effort to end his life.

Thompson was charged with Aggravated Assault on a Police Officer and Attempted Theft in the amount of $7000.
