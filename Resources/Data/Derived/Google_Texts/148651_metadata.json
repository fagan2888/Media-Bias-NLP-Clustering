The GOP race is as crazy and crowded as a Black Friday at Wal-Mart, while the Democrats\u2019 contest is, to quote Leonard Cohen, as dead as heaven on a Saturday night. It\u2019s only partly due to their very different circumstances.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s lead within her party bests that of any non-incumbent since Dwight Eisenhower, and maybe ever. Her Democratic support tops off at over 60 percent; her toughest opponents barely crack double digits. In a Fox News poll, Jeb Bush squeaks past Rand Paul by 15 percent to 13 percent.\n\nIf Hillary\u2019s crowned, too bad for her. She\u2019s caked in rust. She botched last year\u2019s rollout of her latest memoir, as when she told Diane Sawyer she and Bill left the White House \u201cdead broke.\u201d When Jon Stewart asked her how she\u2019d fix foreign policy she replied, \u201cWe have not been telling our story\u2026 we did a much better job back in the Cold War.\u201d Translation: a little programming upgrade for Radio Free Europe and we\u2019re fine. By the end she\u2019d made history: the first candidate ever to lose a book tour.\n\nThe difference between the parties goes way beyond the relative size and strength of their fields. Republicans are now in their fourth decade of an often bitter and very public war over ideas. It\u2019s led by think tanks and wealthy funders\u2014yes, the Kochs\u2014but lately two leading presidential candidates, Bush and Paul, have been in the thick of the fight.\n\nDemocrats don\u2019t engage in that kind of public debate, not even after a public whipping. Their think tanks are fewer in number and not nearly as well-funded. Those they have enjoy less status within their party and less access to its leaders, who\u2019d rather spend their time and money kibitzing with pollsters and media consultants about \u201cmessage.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s what Hillary\u2019s doing now. Her advisers think by laying low she avoids risk, but it leaves a poor impression. While Jeb Bush appears focused on America\u2019s future, she seems focused on her future. It may not be fair to her but it\u2019s fair comment on the two parties\u2019 very different styles. Yes, Republicans have more rich guys and probably pay their pollsters more money, but they also have real debates. One may ask why Democrats don\u2019t, or if they ever will.\n\nThe first question\u2019s easy. Democrats don\u2019t debate policy because they can\u2019t. They can\u2019t because they tell their donors one thing and their base another. This divides policy from message. It\u2019s a situation rich with irony: To pay for populist-themed ads they mortgage themselves to the status quo. Needless to say, when they divvy up the spoils, the donors get policy and the base gets message.\n\nDemocrats hate to hear it, but that\u2019s how it went down in 2008. Obama ran on cleaning up Washington and Wall Street, rescuing homeowners, raising the minimum wage and passing a public option. We know what happened next. The homeowners got the ax. The minimum wage, the public option and the ethics reforms got shelved. Wall Street got a get-out-of-jail-free card.\n\nObama\u2019s defenders say he wanted to do right but Republicans blocked him. I believe he had more leeway than he perhaps wisely let on. (If the public option dies, better the base blames the other side.) But even so, who\u2019s to say if he chose out of preference or perceived necessity? No one has to, because the real problem isn\u2019t him, it\u2019s the system.\n\nBy \u201cthe system,\u201d I don\u2019t mean the whole democracy. I mean the system Democrats regard as inevitable, but which they in fact choose: the system of big money and empty ads; of consultants tied to big business; of elites who manipulate rather than engage the base. It\u2019s the world in which Hillary\u2019s now sequestered and in which she, Obama and most top Democrats have spent their lives.\n\nWe can change the system but only if we admit two things. One is that it won\u2019t change itself. The other is that we don\u2019t need it; indeed, we are far better off without it. These are hard truths for insiders to swallow. But progressives are outsiders and many of them don\u2019t believe this, either.\n\nListening to Obama\u2019s State of the Union, many liberals fell in love all over again. Hailed as a populist manifesto, it was a sharp turn for a guy who after six years of abuse still bleats on about bipartisanship. Some say the \u201cliberating\u201d midterm defeat changed Obama. I\u2019d wager not, but it doesn\u2019t matter. The system has to change and it barely even tries.\n\nAs Obama wrestles with Congress, Democratic candidates dial for dollars or hobnob with consultants. All give rousing populist speeches. Most then seek out quiet places where they can safely whisper to their donors. They\u2019ve been at it so long it doesn\u2019t feel like lying, but if cognitive dissonance were a fatal disease they\u2019d all be dead by morning.\n\nThe advice Democrats get from consultants is killing them but they don\u2019t know it. America needs broad reform to solve problems that affect us all. Consultants micro-target niche constituencies. It turns out you can\u2019t sell big changes with mere slogans. Real reformers must marshal facts and apply logic to sway opinion. Political consultants are in a different line of work.\n\nProgressives waiting for Democrats to change are dangerously deluded. It hurts to admit that their leaders are addicted to money and to the sense of emotional security consultants provide in lieu of insight \u2014 and worse, they can\u2019t see it or change.\n\nThe midterm elections showed just how poorly the Democrats\u2019 business model is working for them. Our entire political debate attests to it. I said last week that the public is growing more progressive. A right-leaning reader wrote in to ask if I\u2019d heard about the election. I did, which is why I didn\u2019t say people are growing more Democratic, just more progressive.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans will have a real debate over ideas heading into 2016.
