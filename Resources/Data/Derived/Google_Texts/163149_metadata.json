That is until her desperate parents turned to the web for research and found the marijuana they now use to treat their child as a last hope salvation. Since then, Charlotte's story has been featured on national TV, drawing even more attention if not relocating families, desperate for anything that will provide relief for critically ill children.\n\nTHC is the cannabinoid that produces the \"high\" marijuana is famous for. CBD is not psychoactive, although it too is classified as a cannabinoid.\n\nThe strain called Charlotte's Web, produced by the Stanley family, one of Colorado's largest growers and dispensary owners, does not produce a \"high\" (because of the low THC content) and is administered as oil extract marketed as \"Realm Oil\" and \"Alepsia.\" The Stanleys subsequently started a 501(c) 3 organization called The Realm of Caring Foundation to \"better provide a better quality of life for residents of Colorado ... through the use of concentrated medicinal cannabis oil.\"\n\nAccording to the Stanleys, the medical oil they use currently is actually made from hemp rather than marijuana. The plants are the same genus of the species Cannabis L. Sativa, but marijuana is bred for higher THC content whereas hemp, historically an industrial plant, is bred for other qualities including fiber content.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "main", "description": "In what is sure to be one of the more controversial aspects coming out of Colorado if not the medical marijuana movement right now is the use of the drug and the chemicals it contains on children with debilitating (mainly) neurological conditions.", "author": "Marguerite Arnold", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "In what is sure to be one of the more controversial aspects coming out of Colorado if not the medical marijuana movement right now is the use of the drug and the chemicals it contains on children with debilitating (mainly) neurological conditions.", "title": "Charlotte's Web Marijuana: A Lorenzo's Oil For Sick Kids?", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/charlottes-web-marijuana-lorenzos-oil-sick-kids", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Insurance", "keywords": "charlotte's web marijuana, israel marijuana research, charlotte figi, thc, cbd, pediatric epilepsy and marijuana, epidiolex, stanley family", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Insurance", "tag": "stanley family", "published_time": "2014-03-19T08:22Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/1610774"}, "date": "2014-03-19T08:22Z", "contentType": "article", "guid": 12785380, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/charlottes-web-marijuana-lorenzos-oil-sick-kids", "site": "@mainstr", "description": "In what is sure to be one of the more controversial aspects coming out of Colorado if not the medical marijuana movement right now is the use of the drug and the chemicals it contains on children with debilitating (mainly) neurological conditions.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Charlotte's Web Marijuana: A Lorenzo's Oil For Sick Kids?"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "charlotte's web marijuana, israel marijuana research, charlotte figi, thc, cbd, pediatric epilepsy and marijuana, epidiolex, stanley family"}, "article_summary": "According to the Stanleys, the medical oil they use currently is actually made from hemp rather than marijuana.\nThe plants are the same genus of the species Cannabis L.
