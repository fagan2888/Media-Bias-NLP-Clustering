For coverage beginning January 2015, small employers statewide can shop the exchange for coverage from Moda Health, and Kaiser will continue selling in the two southern counties. A total of 23 different plans are available from the two insurance companies.\n\nSome businesses using the exchange, called Washington Healthplanfinder Business, will be eligible for federal tax breaks, depending on the number of employees and their salaries.\n\n\u201cWashington Healthplanfinder Business is a historical new option for small employers in Washington state,\u201d said Catherine Bailey, director of the business exchange, in a press release. \u201cSmall businesses will also be able to enjoy the administrative ease that the marketplace provides.\u201d\n\nBailey noted that it\u2019s easy to compare plans on the website, manage employer contributions and allow employees some flexibility in choosing which plan they want.\n\nTwelve employers in Clark or Cowlitz counties currently are enrolled in coverage through Healthplanfinder Business, a marketplace created under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSmall employers are not required to provide health insurance, but most Americans need coverage or face a penalty. People typically have insurance coverage from an employer, a government program such as Medicare or Medicaid, or they can buy it themselves on the individual market. Open enrollment for the individual market begins Nov. 15. Businesses can purchase health insurance throughout the year.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to predict how many businesses will use the small business exchange. Bailey said a conservative goal would be 100 employers, but perhaps even 1,000 will enroll.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping some of the small businesses who aren\u2019t offering coverage will take a look,\u201d said Bailey earlier this fall.\n\nThere are numerous insurance options available to small businesses and non-profit groups in Washington.\n\nFor employers shopping the state\u2019s exchange, the ACA includes a tax benefit covering up to half the cost of the insurance premiums. It applies to employers that paid at least half the cost of their workers\u2019 premiums, and employed fewer than 25 people making on average $50,000 a year. Because Washington\u2019s exchange only included two counties, the tax benefits for 2014 were extended to small businesses outside of the exchange as well.\n\nSmall businesses also can purchase plans through brokers and directly from insurance companies on what\u2019s called the small group market.\n\nBut the most popular alternative historically has been insurance bought from associations or trusts, which act as middlemen between employers and insurance companies. More than 500,000 residents have insurance coverage through an association.\n\nThe associations serve specific sectors such as builders, technology workers or restaurants, by selling insurance to member businesses in those fields. Associations generally offered better prices but could hike rates for companies with less healthy workers. New federal regulations changed the rules for associations, and the Office of the Insurance Commissioner (OIC) has been reviewing the groups to determine who is in compliance.\n\nOn Wednesday, the OIC announced that it had issued its first approval to UnitedHealthcare of Washington\u2019s 2014 plan for Associated General Contractors of Washington. There are more than 60 associations still in review.\n\n\u201cAssociations offer a lot of benefits to their members, and to their communities,\u201d Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler said in a release. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked very hard to reach out to as many associations and insurers as possible for the last several years to help them understand the new federal law.\u201d\n\nIn Washington, there are roughly 340,000 registered small businesses with fewer than 50 workers, according to the state\u2019s Department of Revenue.\n\nNationwide roughly 40 percent of small businesses offer health insurance to their workers, according to the National Federation of Independent Business.", "article_metadata": {"t_omni_path": "st|health|healthcarecheckup|article", "description": "Small businesses throughout Washington \u2014 those with\u00a050 or fewer employees \u2014 can now shop for and enroll in health insurance plans through the state's insurance exchange.
