Pittsburgh police arrested three men early Saturday after a shooting and a brief chase on the south side.

Authorities said the driver of a Chevrolet Impala, Kevin Williams, 25, and two passengers, Gregory Blair Jr., 23, and Quamane Bryant, 24, were taken into custody.

Pittsburgh Public Safety spokeswoman Sonya Toler said the three men were involved in an argument with someone in the 2200 block of East Carson Street that led to gunfire.

Toler said a female bystander was shot in the right hand, and bullets struck a car and a tattoo shop window. She said the three men fled and refused to stop when an officer saw the car driving recklessly along Muriel Street and across the 10th Street bridge.

Police were able to stop the car at Second Avenue and South 10th Street.

Toler said Blair, who had been shot in the elbow, had a gun in his lap. He was taken to University of Pittsburgh Medical Center-Mercy Hospital.

All three men face numerous charges, including aggravated assault and reckless endangerment.
