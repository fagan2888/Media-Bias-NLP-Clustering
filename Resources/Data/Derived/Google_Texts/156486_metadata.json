Likewise, Thurber says, for all the political positioning going on among congressional Republicans, they\u2019ve advanced any number of bills in the face of certain veto because they believe in them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a chess game,\u201d says Thurber.\n\nGame or not, the odds of winning are in Obama\u2019s favor. Presidents have prevailed on 96 percent of their more than 2,500 vetoes over the years, with Congress able to muster the votes to override the presidents\u2019 objections just 4 percent of the time.\n\nOf all the legislation subject to an Obama veto threat, a bipartisan effort to impose new sanctions on Iran to discourage its nuclear program may have the best chance of mustering the two-thirds vote needed to override a presidential veto. A vote on that could come as early as next month.\n\nMany of the other bills don\u2019t stand a chance. And Republicans know that going in.\n\nStill, it\u2019s smart for Republicans to put forward their ideas to show a clear contrast with the president, says Dan Holler, communications director for the conservative Heritage Action for America. Holler said it\u2019s also important to understand that any major legislation that has a chance of being enacted is going to be negotiated with the White House behind the scenes. The odds of winning are in Obama\u2019s favor. Presidents have prevailed on 96 percent of their more than 2,500 vetoes over the years, with Congress able to muster the votes to override the presidents\u2019 objections just 4 percent of the time. \u201cBy necessity that will be quiet,\u201d says Holler, \u201cbecause pretty much every single member of the Republican Party ran against Obama and everything he\u2019s done over the past six years. Their constituents would understandably be upset if they are working hand in glove with the administration.\u201d\n\nBoth sides appear to be \u201cfrontloading\u201d their agendas with confrontational matters to help set the stage for the 2016 elections, with the real work to find compromises to come later, says William Galston, a former Clinton administration official.\n\n\u201cThe question, then, is what does Phase 2 look like?\u201d says Galston. After Obama vetoes GOP proposals and the Republicans fail to override him, \u201cthat\u2019s when the 2015 game begins.\u201d\n\nObama might want to pay more attention to timing if he wants to improve his working relations with congressional leaders.\n\nHis first two veto threats were issued while the new Congress still was being sworn in, prompting plenty of grousing from Republicans.\n\n\u201cHe could have waited a few hours,\u201d said House Speaker John Boehner. \u201cMaybe he could have waited a few days. We were taking our oath of office when they were issuing veto threats.
