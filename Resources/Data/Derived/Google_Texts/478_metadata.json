cybersecurity unit within its criminal division, a top official revealed Thursday.\n\nThe unit will provide legal guidance on electronic surveillance investigations and will work with Congress on cybersecurity legislation, Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell said during a speech at Georgetown University\u2019s law school, according to prepared remarks.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cGiven the growing complexity and volume of cyberattacks, as well as the intricate rubric of laws and investigatory tools needed to thwart the attacks, the cybersecurity unit will play an important role in this field,\u201d she said.\n\nHoused within the department\u2019s computer crime and intellectual property section, the unit will coordinate with the private sector as well as government officials.\n\nIndustry groups have been pressing the government to expand its ability to exchange cyber information with them.\n\n\u201cThis is a fight that the government cannot and will not wage alone,\u201d Caldwell said.\n\nThe unit is also intended to assuage privacy concerns among Americans.\n\nSince former government contractor Edward Snowden revealed a number of secret spy programs, public mistrust of government has risen dramatically.\n\nCaldwell believes \u201cthis kind of mistrust can hamper investigations and cybersecurity efforts.\u201d\n\nCompanies like Apple and Google have promoted enhanced encryption they claim will keep law enforcement from accessing data on their mobile devices.\n\n\u201cMost of this mistrust, however, comes from misconceptions about the technical abilities of the law enforcement tools and the manners in which they are used,\u201d she said.\n\nThe new DOJ cyber team, Caldwell said, will \u201censure that the powerful law enforcement tools are effectively used to bring the perpetrators [of crimes] to justice while also protecting the privacy of everyday Americans.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The team will
