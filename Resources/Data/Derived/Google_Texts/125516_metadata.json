It took her by surprise because she knew that anesthesia for screening colonoscopies (what he was supposed to have had) is now covered by insurance. Before Jan. 1, anesthesia coverage was somewhat murky.\n\nShe also knew that the Affordable Care Act requires most private insurance plans and Medicare to fully cover many preventive services, including screening colonoscopy.\n\nThat meant they should have had no out-of-pocket costs \u2014 no co-payments, coinsurance or deductibles. In this case, the doctors had coded the colonoscopy incorrectly, one of many mistakes that can cause consumers to receive bigger medical bills than they should. According to the American Medical Association, 7 percent of the medical bills in 2013 had errors. Other groups estimate that the figure is much higher. Here are the steps Avitzur took to correct the problem, and what you can do in similar situations:\n\nInform yourself\n\nFamiliarize yourself with what your insurance does and doesn\u2019t cover, and read invoices from your health-care providers and the explanation of benefits from your insurer. Make sure that basic information \u2014 such as your name, contact information, policy and ID numbers, and dates of service \u2014 is correct.\n\nFor preventive services, find out which ones should be fully covered. Two common examples: blood pressure screenings for all adults and diet counseling for adults at higher risk of chronic disease. Get a complete list at www.healthcare.gov/preventive-care-benefits. And be aware that \u201cgrandfathered\u201d insurance plans \u2014 those that existed before March 23, 2010, and haven\u2019t made significant changes to coverage since then \u2014 don\u2019t have to cover preventive tests completely.\n\nTrack down the mistake\n\nIf you get a surprisingly high bill or one you think should have been covered, contact your insurance company\u2019s customer-service department. Confirm that all of the basic information is correct. If you got a bill for a preventive service such as a cholesterol screening, ask whether it should be covered 100 percent, and if so, why you got a bill. (Also determine whether your insurer falls under the grandfathered rule.)\n\nAnd last, find out whether your claim was coded correctly by your doctor or his staff; an error can trigger a denial of coverage. In some cases, the diagnostic code or procedure code may be wrong; in others, a critical number may have been omitted.\n\nAsk for and keep copies of test results. When Avitzur\u2019s primary care doctor sent her husband\u2019s results to her, she could see that the test done was indeed a screening colonoscopy; the gastroenterologist and anesthesiologist had billed for a diagnostic test. Insurance payment rules differ for those two types of colonoscopy.\n\nAs you proceed, write down the name and contact information of those you speak with, along with the date and substance of the conversation. You can also reach out to your state\u2019s department of insurance for help. Learn more at www.consumersunion.org/insurance-complaint-tool.\n\nAsk for a corrected claim\n\nIn most cases, you\u2019ll have to ask your doctor, hospital or outpatient facility to submit a corrected claim. After noticing the billing error, Avitzur called the anesthesiologist and gastroenterologist to tell them the charges were inaccurate. By the end of the day, each had assured her that he would submit corrections to the insurance company.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s best to clarify coverage before a claim is filed. So the next time you schedule a preventive visit, for example, ask whether it will be eligible for no-cost care. And while you\u2019re at that appointment, ask if it is being coded not as a preventive visit but as one where diagnostic care was provided or treatment was done because of something that was found during the exam. (In such a case, you may get a bill you had not anticipated.)\n\nAnd be prepared: October will bring a new system of diagnostic codes. Expect the number of billing errors to balloon \u2014 until doctors and hospitals adapt.\n\nCopyright 2015.
