Preventable hospitalizations are down. Chronic conditions like heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease and diabetes are being managed better. Rates for most of the leading causes of death have declined.\n\nThe bad news: These positive outcomes don\u2019t extend to everyone. As measured by disease incidence and mortality, medically vulnerable populations \u2013 in particular the poor and minorities \u2013 are doing less well.\n\n\u201cThese positive trends aren\u2019t as strong for racial and ethnic minorities, so this is an area of concern,\u201d says Pattie Mansur, a REACH spokeswoman. \u201cOne example is preventable hospitalizations.\u201d\n\nPreventable hospitalizations for both acute and chronic conditions declined in every county, according to the report. But, \u201cwhen viewed by race rather than geography, we see improvement in both categories only for whites,\u201d it states. \u201cPreventable hospitalizations are still rising for blacks with chronic conditions, and for Asians and Hispanics in both categories.\u201d\n\n\u201cClearly your socioeconomic status or your race or ethnicity has an impact on whether you\u2019re participating in these positive outcomes or not,\u201d says Dean Katerndahl, one of the authors of the report, which was prepared for REACH by the Mid-America Regional Council in Kansas City.\n\nOverall, the report concludes that the region is doing a good job of addressing health outcomes, but \u201cits record in addressing health disparities may become a bigger issue in the future as vulnerable populations grow.\u201d\n\n\u201cDisparities persist across geography, race and ethnicity and income \u2013 possibly the biggest health challenge the region faces,\u201d the report\u2019s executive summary states.\n\n\u201cObviously, we need to do a better job of focusing on those who are most vulnerable,\u201d Katerndahl says.\n\nThe report, which updates earlier assessments of regional health in 2010 and 2013, says that poverty in the region is increasing, giving rise to greater numbers of medically vulnerable people.\n\n\u201cWhen you have increases in poverty, you\u2019re going to see poor health outcomes,\u201d Mansur says.\n\nPoverty is one indicator of medical vulnerability, the report notes. Others are age \u2013 especially the very old and very young, who are more susceptible to adverse health conditions; being a member of a racial or ethnic minority, which correlates with higher poverty rates and poorer access to health care; and belonging to a catchall group that includes those with limited English proficiency, undocumented immigrants, the less educated, the disabled and people without health insurance.\n\nThe number of people without health insurance, however, is declining. The report says that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), often referred to as Obamacare, \u201chas had a significant impact in lowering uninsured rates in all counties.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only a first step,\u201d says Mid-America Regional Council economist Frank Lenk, another of the report\u2019s authors, referring to the ACA.\n\n\u201cClearly the idea is that, by having better access to doctors on a more regular basis, problems can be found more quickly and interventions can occur at the stage where an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\u201d\n\nBut Lenk says there\u2019s still a high degree of correlation between health and wealth, \u201cand that\u2019s a large part of what\u2019s showing up in the disparities.\u201d\n\nAnother disparity is geographical: Many area residents, particularly those who live in rural counties, have limited access to health care providers, according to the report.\n\nFor example, there\u2019s one primary care physician for every 906 people in Johnson County, an affluent bedroom community on the Kansas side of the state line. There\u2019s just one for every 4,015 people in largely rural Cass County on the Missouri side.\n\nSimilarly, there\u2019s one mental health provider for every 475 people in Johnson County. There\u2019s just one for every 1,766 people in Cass County.\n\n\u201cThis issue of disparities is a really nagging problem that we haven't effectively addressed yet,\u201d Katerndahl says. \u201cAnd as we become more diverse and face income inequality and things like that, it's going to be a bigger problem. And so we need to figure out how to address it.\u201d\n\nDan Margolies, editor of the Heartland Health Monitor team, is based at KCUR.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "When it comes to health outcomes in the 11-county Kansas City metropolitan area, there\u2019s good news and there\u2019s bad news.
