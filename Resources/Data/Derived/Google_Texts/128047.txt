This one definitely belongs in the “you can’t make this stuff up” file.

A guy whose car plunged into Rock Creek during the floods of last September appears poised to file a lawsuit against his rescuers.

Roy Ortiz told news outlets that rescuers and first responders failed to close a dangerous road during the floods and took too long to rescue him from his car, which went off the road at U.S. 287 and Dillon Road in Lafayette.

Ortiz seems to have mixed feelings about this whole lawsuit thing. CBS4 Denver reports that Ortiz “reluctantly” filed a notice of his intent to sue. The Broomfield man apparently has $40,000 in unpaid medical bills from the accident, and is seeking $500,000 in total damages.

Now, if there is evidence that rescuers were grossly negligent, that would be one thing. But Ortiz and many others were victims of a natural disaster of epic proportions. Perhaps he should sue Mother Nature, too.
