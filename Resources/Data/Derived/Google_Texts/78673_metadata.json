First, new enrollees were somewhat more likely to opt for catastrophic and bronze coverage, while most people with platinum coverage dropped it. The effect of people choosing, on average, a slightly lower-level plan was to reduce premiums by nearly three-fourths of a percent, an IBD analysis finds.\n\nThe second way that premiums understate the apples-to-apples increase in rates is harder to detect but may be significant. Consider that Florida, ObamaCare\u2019s largest exchange with 1.75 million members, saw just a 2.7% hike in premiums, meaning the rest of the HealthCare.gov states saw an average 9.7% hike.\n\nNow take a look at Miami-Dade County, Florida\u2019s largest market and the largest in the county. Centene\u2018s (CNC) Ambetter unit has the two lowest-priced silver plans, including one with an eye-popping $6,500 deductible that is 6.2% cheaper than the cheapest rival plan from Molina Healthcare (MOH).\n\nAs explained at HealthCare.gov, a silver plan is designed to pay 70% of the total cost of covered expenses by all members. Yet that\u2019s not quite true \u2014 especially in markets like Miami, Atlanta, Seattle and Jackson, Miss., where Centene\u2019s Ambetter is the low-cost provider and covers as little as 68% of total member costs.\n\nA primary reason that premiums didn\u2019t rise as much as feared, HHS says, is that consumers were active shoppers and swapped out of plans with big premium hikes. Yet many of these plan changers may have been swapping into plans with higher deductibles, lower cost-sharing and less coverage \u2014 even if they didn\u2019t shift from, say, silver to bronze.\n\nAmong silver plans in the biggest HealthCare.gov markets of each state, the average deductible of the second-lowest-cost silver plan rose 11% from 2015, IBD found.\n\nThe third reason that the HHS spin doesn\u2019t quite add up is that sign-ups among children under age 18 jumped by more than 21% vs. the overall gain of just under 9%. While it\u2019s good that more children have insurance, they cost a whole lot less to insure. Including children in the mix has the effect of lowering the 2016 premium increase by about two-thirds of a percent.\n\nThere\u2019s a good reason that signups in 2016 grew so little \u2014 despite the ramping up of the penalty for going uninsured. Millions and millions of people are finding that the plans provide too little and are too costly \u2014 even with subsidies that held down the effective premium hike to just 4% for the vast majority of exchange shoppers who qualify. While the new HHS data on premiums is misleading in a number of ways, the real problem is that the Obama administration is missing the forest for the trees.\n\nIn coming weeks, insurers will begin to provide an early look at 2017 premiums, and the picture could get worse. One of ObamaCare\u2019s fiercest defenders, Covered California Executive Director Peter Lee, has predicted big premium increases across the country. Meanwhile, UnitedHealth (UNH) has already told Arkansas and Georgia that it\u2019s bailing on their exchanges.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The 8.4% average increase in 2016 ObamaCare premiums reported by the Obama administration understates reality in three main ways.", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "The 8.4% average increase in 2016 ObamaCare premiums reported by the Obama administration understates reality in three main ways.", "title": "ObamaCare Premiums Rose A Lot More Than HHS Wants You To Believe", "url": "http://www.investors.com/politics/policy-analysis/obamacare-is-cheaper-than-feared-not-so-fast/", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Pol01-obamacare-041216-newscom.jpg", "height": 563}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Pol01-obamacare-041216-newscom.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@IBDInvestors"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7-270x270.png", "keywords": "obamacare premiums,exchange enrollment,obamacare deductibles,obamacare", "date": "2016-04-13 10:02:53:-08:00", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-13T17:02:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-13T17:02:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "As explained at HealthCare.gov, a silver plan is designed to pay 70% of the total cost of covered expenses by all members.\nAmong silver plans in the biggest HealthCare.gov markets of each state, the average deductible of the second-lowest-cost silver plan rose 11% from 2015, IBD found.\nA primary reason that premiums didn\u2019t rise as much as feared, HHS says, is that consumers were active shoppers and swapped out of plans with big premium hikes.\nIn coming weeks, insurers will begin to provide an early look at 2017 premiums, and the picture could get worse.\nCentene\u2018s (CNC) Ambetter unit has the two lowest-priced silver plans, including one with an eye-popping $6,500 deductible that is 6.2% cheaper than the cheapest rival plan from Molina Healthcare (MOH)."}
