No one, not even pacifists,\u201d writes Susan Sontag in a 2002 essay for The New Yorker, \u201cLooking at War.\u201d \u201cWe hope only (so far in vain) to stop genocide and bring to justice those who commit gross violations of the laws of war.\u201d We seek, too, to stem the suffering of those caught in war\u2019s cross hairs.\n\nMatter recently published a masterful piece of reporting by Matthieu Aikins, who documented the eight days he spent in Aleppo, Syria, with the Hanano Civil Defense Team. \u201cWhoever Saves a Life\u201d tells the gripping, high-stakes story of a group of young men, all volunteers and none much older than 28, who have stayed in the ragged, bombed out city to work as first responders. Mr. Aikins traveled with a guide, Salem Rizek, and a photographer, Sebastiano Tomada, whose striking pictures illustrate the story.\n\nWhen a bomb or shell hits \u2014 as many do, over the course of each grinding day \u2014 the men travel in a dusty red truck to the site of the destruction. Depending on how lucky those in the area were, the men either collect the bodies of the dead, provide emergency medical treatment or break through layers of concrete to rescue survivors.\n\n\u201cImagine a spread of loose photographs extracted from an envelope that arrived in the morning mail,\u201d writes Ms. Sontag. \u201cThey show the mangled bodies of adults and children. They show how war evacuates, shatters, breaks apart.\u201d\n\nMr. Tomada\u2019s photos (linked throughout this article) do the same, as described in the words of Ms. Sontag: \u201cLook, the photographs say, this is what it\u2019s like. This is what war does. And that, that is what it does, too. War tears, rends. War rips open, eviscerates. War scorches. War dismembers. War ruins.\u201d\n\nMr. Aikins is present when the team\u2019s hide-out, the station house of a former car impound, is nearly hit by what appears to be a barrel bomb. These are \u201cthe improvised but lethal explosives the regime had come to favor,\u201d Mr. Aikins writes.\n\n\u201cTo be hit by an explosion at close range is to experience light and sound as darkness and silence; silence as your ears ring louder than any sound, darkness as dust and smoke envelop you,\u201d Mr. Aikins writes.\n\nMr. Aikins documents the close call with the barrel bomb in words, but he decides that a visual will do more to illustrate the destruction. In addition to the article, Mr. Aikins narrates a short video shot by Mr. Tomada, \u201cCheating Death in Syria.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the room we were staying in when the bomb dropped,\u201d he begins. Mr. Aikins points to a window that has been blown out by the bomb. \u201cComing back during the day you can really see the scale of the damage and just how lucky we are that the bomb didn\u2019t hit this place directly. It would have wiped us all out.\u201d\n\nAnother wall of the building has two gaping holes. A diagonal fissure runs between them. \u201cYou can see that the whole building is on the verge of collapsing,\u201d he says. Mr. Aikins reassures viewers, however, that no one was badly injured.\n\nOutside, Mr. Aikins walks across an expanse of rubble. He gestures to a section of a wall from the neighboring house that collapsed. \u201cThis used to be a house,\u201d he says, the only inflected word he speaks in an otherwise steady tone. He picks up the remnants of the propane tank that comprised the bomb. \u201cIt\u2019s actually really heavy, thick steel,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can imagine when that flies through the air that\u2019s capable of cutting people completely in half.\u201d\n\nAs Mr. Aikins writes in his longer article, but which is not shown in Mr. Tomada\u2019s photographs, two barrel bombs hit the edge of a park earlier that day and did exactly that. What should we experience in words, and what in images? Mr. Aikins writes that one of the rescue workers finds a body in the road: \u201cAli ran toward a barely recognizable object on the sidewalk. It was a portly man who had been stripped of his clothes and powdered the color of concrete dust. He had been severed in half at the navel; his intestines were scattered behind him and one of his legs was folded up over his shoulder. He lay face down, and his eyes were closed, but as Ali ran up, his chest rose and fell a single time. Then he was still.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140919115615, "BN": "op-talk", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/optalk", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/op-talk/post", "per": "Assad, Bashar al-;Sontag, Susan", "org": "Free Syrian Army;National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces", "keywords": "Assad Bashar al-,Sontag Susan,Bombs and Explosives,Emergency Medical Treatment,Photography,Free Syrian Army,National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces,Aleppo (Syria),Syria,Audio and Video", "GBLC": "Audio and Video", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/op-talk/This Is What a City Under Bombardment Looks Like  ( 20140919 )", "news_keywords": "Aleppo Syria,Bashar al-Assad,Bombs,Emergency medicine,Free Syrian Army,National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces,Photography,Susan Sontag,Syria", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Anna Altman", "SCG": "op-talk", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Anna Altman", "byl": "Anna Altman", "twitter": {"description": "A short video and photographs documenting indiscriminate bombing in Aleppo, Syria, prompt reflections of how we experience war from a distance, through images or in words.", "title": "This Is What a City Under Bombardment Looks Like", "url": "http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/19/this-is-what-a-city-under-bombardment-looks-like/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@nytopinion", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000003125748, "description": "A short video and photographs documenting indiscriminate bombing in Aleppo, Syria, prompt reflections of how we experience war from a distance, through images or in words.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "September 19, 2014", "article": {"section": "Opinion", "tag": "Audio and Video", "published_time": 1411142175, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2014-11-05T16:02:26-05:00"}, "geo": "Aleppo (Syria);Syria", "utime": 20141105160226, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140919, "pdate": 20140919, "des": "Bombs and Explosives;Emergency Medical Treatment;Photography", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Op-Talk", "description": "A short video and photographs documenting indiscriminate bombing in Aleppo, Syria, prompt reflections of how we experience war from a distance, through images or in words.", "title": "This Is What a City Under Bombardment Looks Like", "url": "http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/19/this-is-what-a-city-under-bombardment-looks-like/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/19/this-is-what-a-city-under-bombardment-looks-like/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "This Is What a City Under Bombardment Looks Like", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "September 19, 2014"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbc74\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Aikins traveled with a guide, Salem Rizek, and a photographer, Sebastiano Tomada, whose striking pictures illustrate the story.\nThese are \u201cthe improvised but lethal explosives the regime had come to favor,\u201d Mr. Aikins writes.\nMr. Aikins writes that one of the rescue workers finds a body in the road: \u201cAli ran toward a barely recognizable object on the sidewalk.\nMr. Aikins reassures viewers, however, that no one was badly injured.\nOutside, Mr. Aikins walks across an expanse of rubble."}
