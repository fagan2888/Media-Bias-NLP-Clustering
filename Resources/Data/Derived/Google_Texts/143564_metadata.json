The discussions led to an insight that changed the way the carrier does business.\n\n\u201cWe had an 84-page manual on periodic maintenance of tractors, but on people, we were lacking,\u201d said Rich Krutsch, director of human resources, in an interview with Arkansas Business.\n\nThe company discovered that it was spending money on major medical costs because it wasn\u2019t addressing common primary care and preventative measures for its employees. To solve the problem, ArcBest built a free clinic for its employees.\n\n\u201cThe cost in our health care is hospitalization stays,\u201d said Krutsch. \u201cThat is where the costs are. If we reduce that, get to the cause of those hospitalization stays, that\u2019s where the benefit is.\u201d\n\nThe clinic opened last month and serves approximately 1,200 non-union employees who work out of the Fort Smith area. Services are free to those employees and just $15 for their dependents. Non-union employees who work out of other areas visit the clinic when they come through headquarters. Union employees are covered under their union\u2019s healthcare plan.\n\nArcBest will spend around $600,000 each year for the clinic\u2019s service, but the company is confident it will pay off in healthier employees.\n\n\u201cWhen people have access to care and someone to be an advocate for their health, it is always going to be a better outcome. Having access to health care is always beneficial,\u201d said Dr. Shawn Miller, the clinic\u2019s family practitioner.\n\nThe added convenience of having a free walk-in clinic has improved the quality of life for employees. Truck drivers often overlook or put off health concerns because their schedules prevent them from making an appointment at a traditional office. When they do seek care at acute care clinics along their routes, they do not have access to the same resources or continuity of care that a primary care physician offers.\n\nArcBest has already seen employees come in saying that they wouldn\u2019t have visited a doctor if not for the company clinic. As a result, those employees have been able to address issues that might have worsened or affected their job performance without treatment.\n\nIt will be a few years before company executives have the numbers to prove whether or not the clinic is good for the bottom line in the long run, but that hasn\u2019t staunched their optimism.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a win for us, and it\u2019s a win for our employees,\u201d Krutsch said. \u201cThat feels good to us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"type": "article"}, "keywords": "arcbest,free clinic,company clinic,arcbest clinic,health care,cost of health care,rich kurtsch,dr. shawn miller", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.2", "description": "ArcBest, a large Arkansas-based carrier, is addressing health care costs by opening a free clinic for its employees.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "ArcBest has already seen employees come in saying that they wouldn\u2019t have visited a doctor if not for the company clinic.\nTo solve the problem, ArcBest built a free clinic for its employees.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a win for us, and it\u2019s a win for our employees,\u201d Krutsch said.\nThe added convenience of having a free walk-in clinic has improved the quality of life for employees.\nHaving access to health care is always beneficial,\u201d said Dr. Shawn Miller, the clinic\u2019s family practitioner."}
