Less than a week before Christmas, temperatures in Denver are soaring near 60 degrees with sunny skies.

Denver residents who take the opportunity to soak up the unseasonably warm sun on Saturday will be greeted by a high of 57 degrees and blue skies.

The mountain regions are likely to get windy with gusts exceeding 35 miles per hour over higher passes, the National Weather Service in Boulder said.

Temperatures are cooling down on Sunday with a high of 44 degrees and partly cloudy skies, the weather service said.

A weather system bringing chillier temperatures to the plains is also expected to drop about one to four inches of snow in the mountains.

Monday along the Front Range is predicted to be cooler with a high of 39 degrees, although the sun should still be out, and snow is not expected to make an appearance.
