Students and teachers alike gathered at a gymnasium on the George Washington University campus Wednesday night to attend a private vigil for 19-year-old student Nick Upton.

Upton is believed to have drowned while swimming in South Africa during a study abroad trip on Sunday.

According to WJLA:

George Washington Dean of Students Peter Konwerski said, “They asked for a time and place to gather as a community, and so the university wanted to support them in reflecting on their time with him and celebrating him.” Upton was a popular figure on campus. The Connecticut native was on the men’s rowing team and belonged to a fraternity. Many of those in attendance tonight were those closest to him: teammates and fraternity brothers. “Anytime that a tragedy like this occurs, the university pulls together and we really support each other, and that’s really the reason why the community came out tonight, “says Konwerski.

South African rescuers have called off the search after diver and helicopter searches proved futile. Some still hold on to the hope that his body will be found.

NBC4 reported:

Upton’s mother, Margaret Mirowski said she and her husband will fly to South Africa tomorrow and launch a search of her own. A GoFundMe page has been set up to fund their trip.

Upton is a member of the Kappa Alpha fraternity and the GW men’s rowing team, according to Kappa Alpha’s Facebook page and the GW Hatchet.
