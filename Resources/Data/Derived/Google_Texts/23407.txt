Democratic Michigan gubernatorial candidate Mark Schauer personally voted in the 2012 Republican presidential primary to hurt Mitt Romney. But don’t commit voter fraud, kids.

Incumbent Republican Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder leads Schauer by between two and five points in a very close race Tuesday. Schauer, The Daily Caller recently revealed, chose not to sign his campaign staff up for Obamacare, but rather for health plans through the Michigan Small Business Association.

Turns out Schauer likes private non-Obamacare plans just as much as he likes voting for Republicans.

Last time Michigan held national elections in 2012, Schauer filled out and sent in an absentee ballot in the state’s Republican primary as part of an effort by state Democratic insiders to weaken presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney, operatives discovered.

“There was nobody to vote for on the Democratic side of the ballot,” Schauer told mlive.com at the time that his absentee ballot was discovered. “I try not to miss any elections, and so no, I don’t encourage that, but I think that’s up to every individual voter to decide. Michigan is full of crossover and independent voters.”

“If you do not have photo ID or do not bring it with you to the polls, you may still vote,” according to the state government of Michigan. “Simply sign an affidavit stating that you are not in possession of photo identification. Your ballot is included with all others and is counted on Election Day.”
