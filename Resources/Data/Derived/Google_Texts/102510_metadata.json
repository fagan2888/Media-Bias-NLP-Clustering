But after Denver Public Schools worked with Slow Food Denver to create food-safety guidelines, the garden-to-cafeteria movement is spreading across the country, and the DPS food safety protocol is now a national model. By May 2013, four states and the District of Columbia had laws to ensure that produce from school gardens could be served in school cafeterias, according to the nonprofit ChangeLab Solutions.\n\n\u201cThe kids are really excited about it,\u201d said Emily O\u2019Winter, healthy schools coordinator at Jeffco Public Schools, which tested pilot programs at four of its schools last year. \u201cThey\u2019re so proud. At the salad bar, they look for their tomatoes from the garden.\u201d\n\nExperts say the trend is rooted in a convergence of events: the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 that targeted childhood obesity; new USDA nutritional requirements that fruits and vegetables be served daily at school lunches; and the growth in consumer demand for foods grown locally.\n\nAt first, the idea of serving vegetables from school gardens in school cafeterias was so novel that some school districts wouldn\u2019t allow it, pushback that was \u201cprimarily a misunderstanding about food safety policy and rules,\u201d said Andrew Nowak, the Denver-based director of the national school garden program for Slow Food USA. \u201cPeople thought kids can\u2019t do this because they can\u2019t handle a harvest and handle food safely.\u201d\n\nNow, demand is growing faster than basil.\n\nThis spring Nowak \u2014 who worked with the Denver Department of Environmental Health to pioneer the DPS food-safety protocols \u2014 spoke on a panel about overcoming obstacles to the garden-to-cafeteria movement at the National Farm to Cafeteria Conference.\n\n\u201cThe room was packed,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople were sitting on the floor wanting to hear about these protocols, and how school districts were buying (vegetables) from school gardens.\u201d\n\nIn Denver, it all started in 2010 while Congress was still debating the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. Leo Lesh, then director of DPS Food and Nutrition Services, decided to convert all school kitchens to scratch cooking, and also ordered 85 salad bars for DPS cafeterias.\n\n\u201cThe need for produce increased so much, and Steele Elementary ran out of produce, but they had a garden,\u201d recalls Anne Wilson, farm to school coordinator for DPS.\n\nLesh, wondering if that garden\u2019s produce could be used in its salad bars, called Nowak at Slow Food Denver to ask if that was possible. Finding few examples in the nation, Nowak worked with local health officials to create food-safety protocol for a garden-to-cafeteria program at DPS.\n\nThat protocol is now available at all county health departments around Colorado \u2014 a template that school districts throughout Colorado can customize.\n\nThe general principle remains the same: Students are paid for their crops, with the money going back into the program to help make it sustainable. In Denver, students grew more than 4,500 pounds of vegetables and earned more than $5,260 since 2010.\n\nBut it\u2019s not about the money.\n\nStudies show that hands-on gardening, in combination with nutrition education, are an effective way to change children\u2019s attitudes about eating healthy foods: A 2007 study of sixth-graders showed they increased their consumption of fruits and vegetables by 2\u00bd servings a day, more than doubling their overall consumption.\n\nBringing this food to the table is added enticement.\n\n\u201cLast year we grew Sun Gold tomatoes that are very sweet, almost like candy,\u201d said Jamie Humphrey, dietitian for Colorado Springs School District 11. \u201cThey said, \u2018Oh, gosh, that tastes a lot different from what\u2019s in the store.\u2019 \u201c\n\nShe oversees more than 100 raised beds in the garden at the Galileo School of Math and Science, which this year is expected to yield 5,000 pounds of vegetables.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to expand their palate and try new things,\u201d said Humphrey. \u201cBeets and kale are not as popular as lettuce, tomatoes and bell peppers.\u201d\n\nIn Weld County, at least four schools have garden-to-cafeteria programs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a win-win,\u201d said Rachel Hurshman, wellness specialist at Greeley-Evans School District 6.\n\nThe school gets another way to promote healthy eating, and the kids \u2014 who\u2019ve worked hard to get things to grow from seeds \u2014 are more willing to explore adventures in eating.\n\n\u201cIt takes a kid 11 times to decide if they like a food or not,\u201d she said. \u201cThe more we can get them to try it, and buy into the process, hopefully the more vegetables they will eat in the future.\u201d\n\nColleen O\u2019Connor: 303-954-1083, coconnor@denverpost.com or twitter.com/coconnordp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Produce from school gardens increasingly ends up in school cafeterias", "title": "Produce from school gardens increasingly ends up in school cafeterias", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/27/produce-from-school-gardens-increasingly-ends-up-in-school-cafeterias/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140727__20140728_A1_CDXXGARDENCAFETERIAp2.jpg", "height": 474}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140727__20140728_A1_CDXXGARDENCAFETERIAp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-27T21:11:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:10:48+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5c39\"", "article_summary": "Finding few examples in the nation, Nowak worked with local health officials to create food-safety protocol for a garden-to-cafeteria program at DPS.\nThis year, another Colorado school district will join the growing national movement to bring fresh vegetables from school gardens into school cafeterias, directly onto the plates of the students who grew them.\nBy May 2013, four states and the District of Columbia had laws to ensure that produce from school gardens could be served in school cafeterias, according to the nonprofit ChangeLab Solutions.\nLesh, wondering if that garden\u2019s produce could be used in its salad bars, called Nowak at Slow Food Denver to ask if that was possible.\nBut after Denver Public Schools worked with Slow Food Denver to create food-safety guidelines, the garden-to-cafeteria movement is spreading across the country, and the DPS food safety protocol is now a national model."}
