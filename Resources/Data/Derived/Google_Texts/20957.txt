Although radiology reimbursement continues to drop, purchasers often can achieve savings from $92,400 to $380,000 off the quoted vendor price for CT systems. Savings can be considerably higher depending on specific applications, selection of the tube coverage and if various third party items are included in the contract.

The price ranges below are sound values to use for budgetary consideration, but not for negotiation. For example, looking at the 16-20 slice CT deals included, the average savings identified is $92,400, for the 64-80 slice CT, the average savings identified can be $168,245 and the savings identified for the premium high end CT scanner (128 – 360) is $380,000. Values vary by vendor, model, clinical application and variables related to how the quote is configured and the purchase situation.

Keys to finding savings include creating a strong, united team approach and deciding on what coverage is best for the particular CT scanner, starting with its applications and reviewing its previous maintenance reports (installed base). From there keep a unified approach to the price of the system as well as the service contract on the back end for new system purchases.

For service contracts, prices are highly variable, depending on the level of coverage. Most vendors offer a “menu” for service and support that allow facilities to choose various options of service coverage (comprehensive, multi-level and contract term) to meet the needs and applications of the CT scanner. The facility should choose the service type and coverage, uptime guarantee, hours of coverage, etc., according to their specific caseload or patient volume.

Contracts can include transitional coverage from full service and in-house support over the contract term. All CT vendors offer real-time monitoring with remote diagnostics. Obtaining bids at different levels of service and possibly assuming more risk will lower the price of the service contract.

When it comes to service contracts, third party options are often much less expensive as compared to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). For example, savings on CT injectors are around $1,200 on average for third party maintenance as compared to the OEM.
