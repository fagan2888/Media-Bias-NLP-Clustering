They\u2019ve pushed air quality to unprecedented unhealthy levels in neighboring Singapore and Malaysia, while smoke has forced some schools to close, airlines to delay and cancel flights, and has left more than half a million Indonesians suffering from respiratory ailments. Indonesia\u2019s Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency called them a \u201ccrime against humanity of extraordinary proportions.\u201d\n\nThese fires are particularly harmful to the environment since they are peat fires, which emit up to 10 times more greenhouse gases in the form of methane gas than fires on other land. NASA satellites have detected more than 117,000 individual fires this year alone.\n\nPhoto by Sutanta Aditya/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nPhoto by Sutanta Aditya/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nPhoto by Ulet Ifansasti/Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAir pollution has been an annual problem for the past 18 years in Indonesia. It\u2019s caused by the illegal burning of forest and peat fires on the islands of Sumatra and Borneo to clear new land for the production of pulp, paper, and palm oil. Singapore and Malaysia have offered to help the Indonesian government to fight against the fires, while authorities are conducting investigations of hundreds of Southeast Asian firms in connection with these.\n\nNeighboring countries and the entire international community have been putting more pressure on Indonesia to control the fires ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris this week.\n\nPhoto by Darren Whiteside/Reuters\n\nPhoto by Azwar/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nPhoto by Feny Selly/Antara Foto/Reuters\n\nPhoto by Akbar Nugroho Gumay/Antara Foto/Reuters\n\nPhoto by Wahdi Septiawan/Antara Foto/Reuters\n\nPhoto by Xinhua/Zulkarnain via Getty Images\n\nPhoto by Beawiharta/Reuters\n\nPhoto by Beawiharta/Reuters\n\nPhoto by Edgar Su/Reuters\n\nPhoto by Aditya Pradana Putra/Antara Foto/Reuters\n\nPhoto by Beawiharta/Reuters\n\nPhoto by Rosa Panggabean/Antara Foto/Reuters", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "Indonesia\u2019s fires are an environmental catastrophe and a climate change nightmare.", "fb-share": "Though they haven't gotten much press, Indonesia's fires are exactly the type of environmental disasters we can't afford right now.
