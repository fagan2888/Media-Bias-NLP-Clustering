Turkish authorities claim that the Russian plane had violated Turkey\u2019s airspace \u2013 something Russia denies \u2013 and said the pilots were warned 10 times before their plane was brought down with a missile launched by one of the Turkish jets. One of the Russian plane\u2019s two pilots was reportedly killed.\n\nRelated: 3 Reasons Americans Are Losing Confidence in Obama\u2019s Fight Against ISIS\n\nThe incident puts Putin in a delicate position. Part of his domestic popularity is based on his projection of strength and his new assertion of Russia\u2019s power on the world stage. Some sort of reaction to the downing of a plane seems inevitable.\n\nHowever, whether the shoot-down was justified or not, if Putin chooses to respond with force against Turkey, it would place him in direct conflict with a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization whose mutual defense pact requires each member to come to the aid of any single member country that is attacked.\n\nTurkey called an emergency meeting of NATO officials for Tuesday evening.\n\nWhen the news first broke, Kremlin spokesperson Dimitry Peskov reacted cautiously. \u201cWe have to be patient, it is a very serious incident, but again, without all of the information it is impossible to say anything and it would be wrong.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Allies and Adversaries Should Unite to Defeat ISIS\n\nHowever, not long afterward, Putin, who was meeting with the king of Jordan at the Russian resort town of Sochi, explicitly condemned the attack as a crime.\n\n\u201cThis tragic event will have serious consequences for Russian-Turkish relations,\u201d Putin said, according to Russian media reports. \u201cWe have always regarded Turkey not only as a close neighbor, but also as a friendly state. I don\u2019t know who needed what was done today, but we didn\u2019t in any case.\u201d\n\nThe Russian president also criticized the Turkish government\u2019s reaction after the incident, complaining that rather than contacting Russian authorities, \u201cTurkey addressed their NATO partners \u2013 as if it was us who downed their plane, not vice versa.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish decision to shoot down the Russian jet is also likely to complicate the situation in Syria where the U.S. and multiple Western nations are conducting air strikes aimed at the terror group ISIS. In the case of Russia, the targets are both ISIS and rebel groups opposed to Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.\n\nRelated: Why the Pentagon Might Fund Putin\u2019s Russia with Rocket Engine Buy\n\nIn the days leading up to the incident, Putin seemed to have gained an advantage in the international controversy over Russia\u2019s involvement in Syria.\n\nWhen he first sent warplanes to the region, Putin described the Russian mission as countering terrorist groups, with a particular focus on ISIS. However, international observers quickly noted that the vast majority of Russian strikes were focused not on ISIS, but on rebel groups opposed to Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. It soon became apparent that the primary goal of Russia\u2019s involvement in Syria was to prop up the Assad regime, one of its few allies in the Middle East.\n\nThat changed in wake of two ISIS-related terrorist attacks outside of Syria. On October 31, a bomb brought down a Russian civilian jetliner, killing 224 people. Then, on November 13, ISIS attackers slaughtered 130 people and wounded hundreds more in multiple attacks in Paris.\n\nIt took more than two weeks for Russia to make the determination that ISIS had brought down the plane, but once it did, the Kremlin redirected its efforts in Syria, strengthening its forces there and directing much more firepower at ISIS. At the same time, France greatly stepped up its activity in Syria, launching airstrikes and sending naval forces to the region. France and Russia began operating as allies in the region.\n\nRelated: Trump Vows to Bring Back Waterboarding in Fight Against ISIS\n\nRussian planes have been operating for months in the border region between Turkey and Syria, creating tension between Moscow and the government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara. Russian support of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has included attacks on various rebel groups in Northern Syrian close to the Turkish border and has targeted ethnic Turkmen groups, which the government in Ankara wants protected.\n\nIn addition, Russian planes have reportedly violated Turkish airspace on multiple occasions. At one point, Russia formally apologized for an incursion, blaming it on a navigational error.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "After Turkish planes downed a Russian fighter jet on Tuesday, Western leaders looked a", "title": "Turkey Shoots Down a Russian Fighter Jet: What Will Putin Do?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/24/Downed-Russian-Fighter-Over-Turkey-Ignites-Russia-s-Wrath-What-Will-Putin-Do", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07212014_Putin_European_Union.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/24/Downed-Russian-Fighter-Over-Turkey-Ignites-Russia-s-Wrath-What-Will-Putin-Do", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07212014_Putin_European_Union.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "After Turkish planes downed a Russian fighter jet on Tuesday, Western leaders looked a", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: 3 Reasons Americans Are Losing Confidence in Obama\u2019s Fight Against ISISThe incident puts Putin in a delicate position.\nWhen he first sent warplanes to the region, Putin described the Russian mission as countering terrorist groups, with a particular focus on ISIS.\n\u201cThis tragic event will have serious consequences for Russian-Turkish relations,\u201d Putin said, according to Russian media reports.\nPart of his domestic popularity is based on his projection of strength and his new assertion of Russia\u2019s power on the world stage.\nIn the case of Russia, the targets are both ISIS and rebel groups opposed to Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad."}
