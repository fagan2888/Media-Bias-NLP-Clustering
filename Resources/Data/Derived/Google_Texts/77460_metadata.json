Hossein Salami, the Guard\u2019s deputy leader, said on state TV that allowing the foreign inspection of military sites is tantamount to \u201cselling out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will respond with hot lead (bullets) to those who speak of it,\u201d Salami said. \u201cIran will not become a paradise for spies. We will not roll out the red carpet for the enemy.\u201d\n\nIran and six world powers \u2014 the U.S., the U.K., France, Germany, China and Russia \u2014 have reached a framework agreement to curb Tehran\u2019s nuclear program in return for lifting sanctions, and hope to strike a final deal by June 30.\n\nA fact sheet on the framework accord issued by the State Department said Iran would be required to grant the U.N. nuclear agency access to any \u201csuspicious sites.\u201d Iran has questioned that and other language in the fact sheet, notably that sanctions would only be lifted after the International Atomic Energy Agency has verified Tehran\u2019s compliance. Iran\u2019s leaders have said the sanctions should be lifted on the first day of the implementation of the accord.\n\nThe fact sheet said Iran has agreed to implement the Additional Protocol to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which would grant the IAEA expanded access to both declared and undeclared nuclear facilities.\n\nBut Salami said allowing foreign inspectors to visit a military base would amount to \u201coccupation,\u201d and expose \u201cmilitary and defense secrets.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means humiliating a nation,\u201d Salami said on state TV. \u201cThey will not even be permitted to inspect the most normal military site in their dreams.\u201d\n\nIran allowed IAEA inspectors to visit the Parchin military site in 2005 as a confidence-building measure, but denied further visits, fearing espionage.\n\nWestern nations have long suspected Iran of secretly pursuing a nuclear weapons capability alongside its civilian program. Tehran denies such allegations, and insists its nuclear program is entirely peaceful.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A senior commander in Iran's Revolutionary Guard said Sunday that inspectors would be barred from military sites under any nuclear agreement with world powers.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/19/iran-guard-rejects-inspection-of-military-sites/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "A senior commander in Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard said Sunday that inspectors would be barred from military sites under any nuclear agreement with world powers.", "title": "Iran Guard rejects inspection of military sites"}, "twitter": {"description": "A senior commander in Iran's Revolutionary Guard said Sunday that inspectors would be barred from military sites under any nuclear agreement with world powers.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Iran Guard rejects inspection of military sites"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3c91\"", "article_summary": "TEHRAN, Iran (AP) - A senior commander in Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard said Sunday that inspectors would be barred from military sites under any nuclear agreement with world powers.\nTehran denies such allegations, and insists its nuclear program is entirely peaceful.\nGen.
