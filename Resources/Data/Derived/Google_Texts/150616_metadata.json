This is one of the key findings of a major new survey of 20,000 physicians commissioned by The Physicians Foundation, a nonprofit organization that seeks to advance the work of practicing physicians and help facilitate the delivery of healthcare to patients.\n\nAccording to the research, titled \u201c2014 Survey of America\u2019s Physicians: Practice Patterns and Perspectives,\u201d 81 percent of physicians describe themselves as either over-extended or at full capacity, while only 19 percent indicate they have time to see more patients. Forty-four percent of physicians surveyed plan to take steps that would reduce patient access to their services, including cutting back on patients seen, retiring, working part-time, closing their practice to new patients or seeking non-clinical jobs, leading to the potential loss of tens of thousands of full-time-equivalents (FTEs). As the ranks of Medicare and Medicaid patients increase \u2013 in 2011, more than 75 million baby boomers began turning 65 and qualifying for Medicare \u2013 and millions of new patients are insured through the Affordable Care Act, patient access to care could pose significant health delivery and policy challenges.\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s physician workforce is undergoing significant changes,\u201d said Walker Ray, M.D., vice president of The Physicians Foundation and chair of its Research Committee. \u201cPhysicians are younger, more are working in employed practice settings and more are leaving private practice. This new guard of physicians report having less capacity to take on additional patients. These trends carry significant implications for patient access to care. With more physicians retiring and an increasing number of doctors, particularly younger physicians, planning to switch in whole or in part to concierge medicine, we could see a limiting effect on physician supply and, ultimately, on the ability of the U.S. healthcare system to properly care for millions of new patients.\u201d\n\nThe survey, conducted online from March 2014 through June 2014 by Merritt Hawkins for The Physicians Foundation, is based on responses from 20,088 physicians across the U.S. The overall margin of error (MOE) for the entire survey is less than two percent, indicating a very low sampling error for a survey designed to draw opinions and perspectives from a large population.\n\nPhysician Workforce Demographics and Patterns \u2013 A Changing of the Guard\n\nIn comparing the physician surveys conducted by The Physicians Foundation in 2008 and 2012, the 2014 respondents are younger, more work in employed settings (e.g., hospital systems), there are more females and more work in primary care. In 2014, the average age of the respondents is 50, versus an average age of 54 in 2012. In 2014, 33 percent of the survey respondents are female, versus only 26 percent in 2012. Importantly, survey respondents mirror the composition of the current U.S. physician workforce \u2013 providing a representative understanding of the diversity of attitudes and perspectives inherent among America\u2019s doctors.\n\nIn addition to changing workforce demographics, the survey captured significant transitions underway in physician workforce patterns and practice settings. For instance, in 2014, only 17 percent of physicians indicate that they are in solo practice, down from 25 percent in 2012. In 2014, only 35 percent of physicians describe themselves as independent practice owners, down from 49 percent in 2012 and 62 percent in 2008. Fifty-three percent of respondents describe themselves as employees of a hospital or medical group, up from 44 percent in 2012 and 38 percent in 2008. More than two-thirds of employed physicians (68 percent) expressed concerns relative to clinical autonomy and their ability to make the best decisions for their patients.\n\nPhysician Morale \u2013 Outlook Improving, but Pessimism Still Remains High\n\nIn 2012, many physicians described high levels of government regulation, malpractice liability pressures, inadequate and inconsistent reimbursement, and eroding clinical autonomy as factors leading to discontentment. In 2014, survey questions focused more on clinical autonomy, given the significant patient implications. When asked about levels of clinical autonomy and the ability to make the best decisions for patients, 69 percent of physicians indicate that their decisions are often compromised \u2013 demonstrating a strong potential bearing on quality of patient care.\n\nAs seen in previous survey years, a majority of physicians (56 percent) continue to describe their morale as somewhat to very negative However, optimism levels increased between 2014 and 2012. In 2014, 44 percent of physicians characterize themselves as somewhat or very positive about the current state of the medical profession, compared to 32 percent in 2012.\n\nThe reason for this increase could be attributed to the changing composition of the survey respondents. Specifically, 54 percent of younger physicians (ages 45 or lower) surveyed are optimistic about the state of medicine, versus 30 percent of older physicians (ages 46 or higher). Female physicians are slightly more optimistic about the current state of medicine (49 percent) than their male counterparts (42 percent). Fifty-one percent of employed physicians are optimistic about the current state of the medical profession, compared to 33 percent of physicians who own their own practice.\n\nWhen asked about what grade physicians would give the Affordable Care Act (ACA), 46 percent give a D or F grade. Younger (ages 45 or lower), employed physicians were more inclined to give the ACA favorable marks than older (46 or higher), private practice owners. In fact, 63 percent of younger physicians (ages 45 or lower), would give the ACA a grade of C or above.\n\n\u201cThe state of the physician workforce, and medicine in general, is experiencing a period of massive transition,\u201d said Lou Goodman, Ph.D., president of The Physicians Foundation and CEO of the Texas Medical Association. \u201cAs such, the growing diversity of the physician workforce will reflect different perspectives and sentiments surrounding the state of medicine. While I am troubled that a majority of physicians are pessimistic about the state of medicine, I am heartened by the fact that 71 percent of physicians would still choose to be a physician if they had to do it over, while nearly 80 percent describe patient relationships as the most satisfying factor about practicing medicine.\u201d\n\nElectronic Medical Records and Additional Findings\n\nEighty-five percent of physicians surveyed indicate that they have implemented electronic medical records (EMR). Yet, only 24 percent say that EMR systems have improved efficiency and only 32 percent indicate that it has improved quality of care. Nearly half of respondents (47 percent) noted that EMR systems detract from patient interaction.\n\nAdditional survey findings include:\n\nThirty-nine percent of physicians indicate that they will accelerate their retirement plans due to changes in the healthcare system\n\nTwenty-six percent of physicians now participate in an Accountable Care Organization (ACO), though only 13 percent believe ACOs will enhance quality and decrease costs\n\nFifty percent of physicians indicate implementation of ICD-10 will cause severe administrative problems in their practices\n\nPhysicians spend 20 percent of their time on non-clinical paperwork\n\nOn average, physicians surveyed said 49 percent of their patients are enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid\n\nYet 24 percent of physicians surveyed either do not see Medicare patients or limit the number Medicare patients they see\n\nThirty-eight percent of physicians either do not see Medicaid patients or limit the number of Medicaid Patients they see\n\nPhysicians surveyed said they work an average of 53 hours per week and see approximately 20 patients per day\n\n\u201cThe more than 20,000 physicians who participated in this survey also submitted more than 13,000 written comments \u2013 demonstrating the eagerness of doctors to voice their perspectives on the critical issues impacting America\u2019s patients and healthcare system,\u201d said Tim Norbeck, CEO of The Physicians Foundation. \u201cWith more than one million data points derived from this survey, our hope is that policy makers, healthcare influencers, media and other stakeholders will use the findings as a valuable resource to better understand the underlying challenges facing our healthcare system, and formulate effective policies that will advance the health and interests of our patients.\u201d\n\nPlease visit www.physiciansfoundation.org for more information or click here to access the full report.\n\nAbout The Physicians Foundation\n\nThe Physicians Foundation is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization that seeks to advance the work of practicing physicians and help facilitate the delivery of healthcare to patients.
