In this matter, he said he remained \u201cboth a pessimist and a lower-case libertarian.\u201d When it came to \u201cour race\u2019s future in space,\u201d Heinlein predicted that those \u201cwho do not go into space will find, rather quickly, that they can neither control nor tax those who do.\u201d\n\nHeinlein goes on to make it clear that his political position was rested entirely on an unsentimental pragmatism and was \u201cnot based on our Bill of Rights\u201d or \u201clibertarian theory.\u201d A key test for the sci-fi writer was a person\u2019s proposed solution to what he called the Lifeboat Problem \u2013 what rights should an individual be accorded in a place where food, water, air, safety, etc. are in tenuous supply i.e. a submarine or a space colony? 5 In fact, he demanded a solution to this question before \u201cany avowed libertarian\u201d should be allowed \u201cto open his big mouth on the subject of \u201cnatural rights\u201d in space.\u201d\n\nHe framed the scenario thus: \u201cYou are boat officer in a lifeboat, rated capacity 50 persons and it is filled to capacity, a mixture of men, women, and children. In the water are others\u2026The sea is Beaufort scale four or higher; the water is freezing cold. You are armed with a loaded pistol. So far as you know no one else is armed\u2026but you may be mistaken.\u201d What do you do? Rotate people in and out of the life boat every 20 minutes and try to save everyone? Noble but impractical. Maybe someone would suggest taking a vote to which Heinlein said \u201cI would shoot that bastard just for drill.\u201d\n\nSo far as libertarians enamored with theory and posturing \u2013 \u201cAny libertarian so doctrinaire that he cannot find a pragmatic solution to this problem deserves no tolerance from others\u2026Unfortunately a large percentage of those who describe themselves as \u201clibertarians\u201d\u2026would be a a mortal danger to their shipmates.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Patrick McCray, author of the great book on the origins of modern space colony and nanotech thinking, The Visioneers&nbsp;(which I reviewed for Reason", "title": "Robert Heinlein on Libertarianism and the Lifeboat Problem in Space", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2013/09/12/robert-heinlein-on-libertarianism-and-th", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/_external/2013_09/-12.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/_external/2013_09/-12.jpg", "description": "Patrick McCray, author of the great book on the origins of\nmodern space colony and nanotech thinking, \nThe Visioneers&nbsp;(which I reviewed\nfor Reason in our June issue) dug through the Robert\nHeinlein archives and \ncame up with some interesting stuff about the nexus between his\nsometimes militaristic politics and his vision of human future in\nspace, and contains some sneering at certain other types of\nliberta", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Robert Heinlein on Libertarianism and the Lifeboat Problem in Space"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Culture", "published_time": "2013-09-12T18:23:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/brian-doherty"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca98b\"", "article_summary": "In the water are others\u2026The sea is Beaufort scale four or higher; the water is freezing cold.\nSo far as you know no one else is armed\u2026but you may be mistaken.\u201d What do you do?\nRotate people in and out of the life boat every 20 minutes and try to save everyone?\na submarine or a space colony?\nYou are armed with a loaded pistol."}
