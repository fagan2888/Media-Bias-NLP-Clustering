Without question, there are a lot of great companies on that list.\n\nSo why do so many of us feel like a cynic when we read it? Jealousy? A longing to work at one of the great places? As talent pros, are we bracing for our boss to bring us the list and ask why our company wasn\u2019t included?\n\nMy rationalization for feeling jaded and cynical every time I see a list like this is simple: I know (as you do) how hard business is and that the companies included aren\u2019t immune to those challenges. Look closely at the list and pair each company with the Affordable Care Act in a Google search and you\u2019ll see numerous companies that have cut hours for workers to avoid benefit responsibility. Does that sound like a great place to work?\n\nNo. But it does underscore that these companies face the same challenges as your company, and they aren\u2019t perfect. Also included in the 2014 list is a company that prides itself on transparency and a progressive worldview yet suspended a friend of mine for writing a general blog post about what it took to be a great leader. Her boss took that as a criticism and called in HR to deal with the outlier.\n\nAfter being taken out of the work environment for a couple of weeks with no resolution, she resigned. She\u2019s now working for a company that will never make this list, but doesn\u2019t claim to be something it can\u2019t live up to. She\u2019s happier (just add #irony here).\n\nBut I wouldn\u2019t be a true cynic if I didn\u2019t give you a road map for how you can get your company on one of these lists. There are five steps. Do them well and you have a great shot at becoming an \u201cofficial\u201d Great Place to Work.\n\n1. Provide great health care benefits that require no employee contribution for employee or family coverage. Shock and awe time, people: You have medical, dental and vision coverage. Maybe you even have a disability and life insurance suite. You offer it all at no charge to your employees and their families. You are the benefactor, the sugar daddy. Write it off as an investment toward the Great Place to Work award. It has never been more impactful to do this with the ACA bearing down on us all.\n\n2. Offer some killer benefits that look great but are hard to use.The health care benefits are going to cost you dearly, especially if you start having a bunch of high-impact cases. But every benefit doesn\u2019t have to cost tons of money to feel great. Sometimes it just has to look great on paper. Once you\u2019ve taken care of health care, make sure the next layer of benefits looks great but requires sacrifice on the employees\u2019 behalf. Full tuition aid and a 100 percent 401(k) match are great places to start. Both look great but require great discipline and certain life circumstances for a team member to use them. You\u2019re not going to have to provide these benefits for everyone, because they\u2019re hard to take advantage of. But you still get credit for offering them.\n\n3. Broaden your approach to time-off policies. Do you have to offer unlimited time off for everyone? While that would help, the answer is no. Just make sure your time-off policies deliver at least an extra week (if not two) to team members at every level when compared with industry averages or key local competitors. Here\u2019s a hidden secret to these policies \u2013 you can hedge your bets with a \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d policy to keep the accounting tight and a performance edge that ensures the work still gets done.\n\n4. Invest in your workspace. You bought the gray cubicles in the mid-\u201990s, when looking like a big company was the rage. But it\u2019s time to invest in some workspace furniture and features that look progressive. Get an upscale consultant to help you figure out how to look cool, and lease instead of buy so you can spread out the investment over time and trade out as necessary. Can\u2019t do it everywhere? Just make sure your primary location or HQ is ready for the photo-op.\n\n5. Do the Fantasy Island imitation when it comes to the Great Place to Work employee survey. You can\u2019t become a great place to work until your employees are surveyed and confirm that your company is in fact freaking awesome. That means you have to prep your employees to expect the survey and find the right sweet spot between tampering/pressuring them and politely pointing out what a great survey response could mean. It\u2019s like the Fantasy Island intro where Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n tells the staff, \u201cSmiles, everyone, smiles!\u201d before the guests arrive. (FYI to millennials: click the link for video and use this for background).\n\nJaded like me about the Great Place to Work designation? It\u2019s OK; you\u2019re more than half-right. But if you ever want to chase the GPTW designation, use my road map and you\u2019re on the way. Don\u2019t forget to tell everyone to smile \u2014 even Tatoo.\n\nKris Dunn, the chief human resources officer at Kinetix, is a Workforce contributor.
