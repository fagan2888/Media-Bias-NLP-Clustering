In 1983, he was the State Department\u2019s top analyst investigating the shootdown of a South Korean airliner by the Soviets. And Jim Hall, the former chair of the National Transportation Safety Board. The board investigated the crashes of TWA Flight 800 and Egypt Air 990 while he was chairman.\n\nRELATED LINKS Gentlemen, thank you both for joining us.\n\nCharles Duelfer, what would it take to shoot down a commercial airline flying at 33,000 feet?\n\nCHARLES DUELFER, Former CIA Official: Well, unfortunately, there is a lot of capacity in the region to do that.\n\nThe Russians have missile systems to do just this. And apparently these missile systems have now come into the hands of both Ukraine and Ukrainian separatists. So, it\u2019s not a difficult task for a sophisticated army.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Is it possible to confuse a commercial airliner with a military transport plane?\n\nCHARLES DUELFER: Well, in fact, this is probably what happened in 1983, when the Russians shot down a 747. They were suspicious that it was an American surveillance aircraft. My guess\u2026\n\nGWEN IFILL: This was the Korean airline\u2026\n\nCHARLES DUELFER: That\u2019s the Korean airliner from \u2014 in 1983.\n\nIf you take one of these military systems and you take it out of an overall air defense system, where you have just got a small unit, and they\u2019re looking at aircraft outside of any other data, they could look up and misidentify an aircraft.\n\nI think that\u2019s possibly what happened in this case, where they may have thought they were aiming at an Antonov, a transport aircraft which would be associated with the Ukrainian military, and in fact have been aiming at this 777.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Jim Hall, we look at the airspace. We know about the conflict in Ukraine. How safe was it for that airliner to be flying through that airspace at that altitude?\n\nJIM HALL, Former Chairman, National Transportation Safety Board: Well, we don\u2019t know for sure.\n\nThe integrity of this investigation, which I agree should be an international investigation, is critical, in my opinion, to all of the nations in that region. And so the airspace, as I understand it, was cleared for commercial flight.\n\nSo either we\u2019re looking at a criminal act and the dastardly act that took 295 lives, or a horrible mistake. And the world needs to know that, or it\u2019s going to have, as I said, a chilling affect on international aviation.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Jim Hall, you have investigated unexpected \u2014 and I guess they are all unexpected \u2014 crashes and accidents before. What is the first thing you look for to determine whether in fact it was a terrible failure of the aircraft itself or someone\u2019s decision to take it down?\n\nJIM HALL: Well, of course, most of that information is going to be contained in the black boxes. Hopefully, they are in the process of being recovered, the flight data recorder, the cockpit voice recorder.\n\nYou are going to be looking obviously at the air traffic control tapes and any other type of information that you might have that involved communications between the ground and this aircraft.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Charles Duelfer, President Putin apparently informed President Obama about this in a phone call earlier in the day, which would lead one to believe that he was trying to say this was not \u2014 we had nothing to do with this, or I guess he wouldn\u2019t have brought it up.\n\nIn the past, especially in the Korean airliner incident, is this something that anybody would readily admit to, or did this have to be unearthed in the investigation?\n\nCHARLES DUELFER: I think the Russians learned from their experience in 1983, where they handled it very badly by denying it for a long period of time. And then they were caught out because the United States intelligence had collected the communications, which was very blatant. And they were played in the Security Council.\n\nI would add to what Jim has said about the crash investigation. There\u2019s going to be a lot of intelligence information. This is one of the most heavily surveilled places on the planet, where they have satellites which are looking for just missile launches because we\u2019re concerned about attacks from Russia.\n\nSo there will be a lot of supplementary data. I think the case \u2014 this will be an answerable thing. People will know why this airplane went down. The open question will be who has responsibility for it. And that\u2019s where I think we\u2019re going to see Russia maneuvering to try to shift responsibility and Ukrainians trying to place responsibility on Russia, if not the separatists.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Jim Hall, let me ask you a little bit about this idea of being able to trace the cause for the plane going down.\n\nThis is \u2014 even though it\u2019s Malaysia Airlines and we spent a lot of time talking about the Malaysia Airlines jet that went missing within the last six months, what is different here in terms of the number of ways to monitor this flight path and what happened when impact presumably occurred?\n\nJIM HALL: Well, of course, the most significant difference is that we have the wreckage, regrettably.\n\nWe know where it\u2019s located, which does set up a certain international protocols in terms of an investigation, which I\u2019m pleased to hear \u2014 and I hope both sides in the Ukrainian dispute will agree to an international investigation of this matter.\n\nBut having the evidence and hopefully having the information on the black boxes and having the recovery of those black boxes and the cooperation of the various countries that this aircraft flew through in providing this information will have a more transparent and a more detailed investigation into this Malaysian accident than we have seen today in the previous one.\n\nGWEN IFILL: And let me ask you one more question about that.\n\nThe airspace wasn\u2019t closed where this flight was maneuvering through. At least it was flying above the closed portion of the airspace, but it has been closed now. Is it your understanding now or would it be your advice if you were in a similar position to keep that closed for the length of this investigation?\n\nJIM HALL: Well, I think that\u2019s just common sense at this point.\n\nThere are obviously individuals on the ground that have weapons capable of reaching the altitude of the most sophisticated aircraft flying now. So, until that dispute can be managed, we certainly need to embargo that airspace.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Charles Duelfer, put your diplomat\u2019s hat on for a moment.\n\nYou know that \u2014 we \u2014 Jim Hall just talked about the potential international reverberations here. What do you see, especially given that this was a touchy war zone in the first place, reverberating from this kind of accident/intentional attack?\n\nCHARLES DUELFER: There\u2019s going to be some serious arguments about whether the Russians are behaving responsibly with respect to their clients, particularly with respect to having them have access to these types of weapons, which outside of the command-and-control of an organized state, you get an airliner passing through airspace, and they have no way of checking, is this a civilian aircraft or is it a friend or a foe?\n\nThat normal structure doesn\u2019t exist. So, I think a lot of the diplomatic argument will take place on that point. And, again, I think the intelligence surrounding this, both from the United States, from the Ukrainians, is going to be very interesting. And I think if they do have tapes of communications, those are going to be very damning in a lot of ways.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Charles Duelfer, Jim Hall, thank you both very much.\n\nCHARLES DUELFER: Thank you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How safe was it for a Malaysia Airlines plane to be flying in airspace over conflict-torn Eastern Ukraine?
