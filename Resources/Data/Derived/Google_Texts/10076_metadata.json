The plan was simple: Talk up the GOP\u2019s support for school choice \u2014 including vouchers to help parents pay for private school \u2014 and win the hearts of moms everywhere.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIt hasn\u2019t worked out like that.\n\nInstead, in Florida, Kansas, Michigan, Pennsylvania and elsewhere, Republicans are on the defensive about education. It isn\u2019t usually a top-tier concern for voters, but Democrats see issues such as college affordability and K-12 funding as their best chance to motivate the on-again, off-again voters who often sit out midterms.\n\n\u201cThe plethora of education messages hitting races at every level is unprecedented,\u201d said Karen White, political director for the National Education Association, which plans to spend as much as $60 million this cycle. \u201cI really do believe it\u2019s the perfect storm around every officeholder in the country.\u201d\n\nJust this week, the NEA\u2019s political action committee went on the air with two new attack ads: One accuses Arkansas Senate candidate Tom Cotton of seeking to cut student loan programs. Another blames Hawaii gubernatorial candidate Duke Aiona for budget cuts that closed K-12 schools on Fridays for months.\n\nAnd there\u2019s more to come.\n\n( Full coverage: All Policy Is Local series)\n\nDemocrats\u2019 top targets are \u201cdrop-off voters\u201d who are ambivalent about casting ballots next month. They include hundreds of thousands of young adults, single women and minorities in key battleground states. In testing messages that might push them to the polls, Democratic strategists have found that education plays extremely well.\n\nAccusing Republicans of cutting programs for students while giving tax breaks to the rich motivates diffident voters more than similarly partisan messages on reproductive rights, the economy or health care, veteran Democratic political strategist Celinda Lake found in a series of focus groups and polls.\n\nLake\u2019s research, commissioned by MoveOn.org, included a survey of 1,000 Democratic voters who said they weren\u2019t sure they\u2019d bother to vote in the key states of North Carolina, Michigan, Kentucky, Colorado and Iowa. Coupling the education theme with talk about the middle class falling behind was \u201cnearly a slam dunk with these targets,\u201d Lake wrote.\n\nDemocratic strategists James Carville and Stan Greenberg came to a similar conclusion after polling 2,200 likely voters in battleground states. They found that unmarried women in North Carolina and Georgia were particularly swayed by messages about expanding access to early childhood education. In Iowa and Colorado, affordable college loans hit the mark. Combining those issues with an appeal to raise the minimum wage, they wrote, creates a \u201cpowerful, populist opportunity to shift the vote.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: The GOP's new take on pre-K)\n\nRepublican strategists aren\u2019t exactly quaking.\n\nChristine Matthews, a partner at Burning Glass Consulting, has spent a lot of time this fall studying women in battleground states. Yes, they care about education. But it\u2019s hardly top-of-mind, she said, in an election season brimming with frightening headlines about terrorist threats, health threats and even threats to the security of the White House.\n\n\u201cThese women are very unsettled about what\u2019s happening in the world right now,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cThey\u2019re feeling a distinct lack of confidence in President [Barack] Obama\u2019s leadership and the way the country is going.\u201d\n\nShe advises Republicans to focus on national security, border security and the economy.\n\nDemocrats and their allies, however, are trying very hard not to let Republicans stay in that comfort zone.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Under GOP, education plan could stall)\n\nThe NEA, the nation\u2019s largest teachers union, has run TV ads in several battleground states, including a Spanish-language spot targeting Republican Senate hopeful Cory Gardner in Colorado and two scorching attack ads against Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback.\n\nThe union also plans to mail hundreds of thousands of fliers this month with positive messages about how their favored candidates would lower class sizes, keep student loan interest rates low and invest more in education. And, in a more personal touch, NEA members are mailing thousands of handwritten postcards to friends and neighbors reminding them to get out and vote. The front of the postcard offers a further nudge, printed on bright yellow: \u201cOur Community. Our Children. Our Future. Vote Nov. 4.\u201d\n\nThe American Federation of Teachers is also playing big this cycle. AFT President Randi Weingarten said the union plans record expenditures of more than $20 million. One in-your-face initiative: a Tumblr page called \u201cyou got schooled\u201d that regularly calls out Republican leaders for policies the union believes hurt students and teachers. This week, the AFT bought airtime in Philadelphia for an ad blaming Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett for problems from \u201cold textbooks to outdated equipment to overcrowded classrooms.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just teachers unions talking education. Democratic candidates are emphasizing the issue, perhaps none more than Sen. Kay Hagan in North Carolina, who even ran radio ads on the subject specifically targeting African-American voters. Environmental groups and women\u2019s groups are also running education spots.\n\nEven unionized steelworkers canvassing for Democrats have learned that education resonates. When they knock on voters\u2019 doors, they might talk first about the need to boost construction jobs by investing in infrastructure \u2014 but then they\u2019ll pivot to college affordability.\n\n\u201cAlmost everyone has a child, a grandchild or maybe it\u2019s themselves trying to pay back student loans,\u201d said John Shinn, director of United Steelworkers District 4, which covers nine states and Puerto Rico. \u201cIt\u2019s a big issue.\u201d\n\nPolitical analysts say the focus on education is clearly having an effect, based on the number of Republican candidates scrambling to address the issue when they\u2019d rather be talking about the economy or Obamacare.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Republicans thought this would be the year to make education their winning issue, but not so far.", "title": "GOP schooled on education politics", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/10/education-democrats-elections-111995.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/10/17/141002_classroom_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "2014 Elections,Education,All Policy is Local Education 2014,Kansas,Florida,Michigan,Pennsylvania", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Republicans thought this would be the year to make education their winning issue, but not so far.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe plethora of education messages hitting races at every level is unprecedented,\u201d said Karen White, political director for the National Education Association, which plans to spend as much as $60 million this cycle.\nIn testing messages that might push them to the polls, Democratic strategists have found that education plays extremely well.\nTom Corbett for problems from \u201cold textbooks to outdated equipment to overcrowded classrooms.\u201dBut it\u2019s not just teachers unions talking education.\nInstead, in Florida, Kansas, Michigan, Pennsylvania and elsewhere, Republicans are on the defensive about education.\nThey found that unmarried women in North Carolina and Georgia were particularly swayed by messages about expanding access to early childhood education."}
