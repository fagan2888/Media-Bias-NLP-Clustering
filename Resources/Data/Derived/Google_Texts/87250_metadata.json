As a child, her biological father molested her. Her stepfather routinely sold drugs to Downing\u2019s friends, teaching them how to cook heroin, encouraging them to party with him. She found her own mother blue in the face one morning, dead from asphyxiation. She also found her boyfriend\u2019s mother, blue in the face, dead from drug use. She watched that same stepfather, with whom she\u2019d maintained a strained but consistent relationship, nod off. She thought he was falling asleep; he was, in fact, dying from an overdose.\n\nAnd because of her own drug use and the use of those around her, Downing lost battles with Child Protective Services for her two daughters.\n\nDowning first started using cocaine at 14, smoking crushed prescription opiates. Heroin followed not long after that. She did hard drugs surrounded by friends and family for years.\n\nBut on a cloudy March day, Downing sits at a table at Neighborcare Health\u2019s Meridian Center for Health in North Seattle \u2014 established in partnership with King County Public Health and Valley Cities Behavioral Health \u2014 clean for the last six months. She got to this point thanks, in large part, to her prescription for Buprenorphine \u2014 Suboxone by its market label. The drug is designed to kill cravings, lighten the effects of withdrawal and pinch off any pleasurable effects of taking opiates.\n\nDowning speaks quickly and frankly as she recounts her brutal life, her voice raspy. She knows she doesn\u2019t have to share everything, but says she wants to, that it\u2019s good for her. Downing kicked her habit almost overnight with the help of Suboxone and has been clean for six months. She calls the little strip she puts beneath her tongue every morning a \u201cmiracle drug.\u201d\n\nBeyond Suboxone, the Meridian Center\u2019s holistic view of healthcare \u2014 seating dentists next to doctors next to behavioral health services next to social workers \u2014 is helping her build other foundations for a better life. As the medicine she gets from Dr. Matt Perez clears the cobwebs of addiction, she is achieving the clarity of mind to work through her trauma just feet down the hall.\n\nNeighborcare is the largest network of community clinics in Seattle. They see 60,000 patients a year, 85 percent of which are on Medicaid. Many are homeless.\n\nThe Meridian Center is the newest addition to the network. It\u2019s a modern building with wood paneling. Inside, natural light catches varnished wooden tables and polished floors. It\u2019s hard not to wonder why every clinic isn\u2019t organized like the Meridian Center for Health, breaking the silos that often exist in healthcare. Because the care they offer spans most corners of the healthcare spectrum, patients don\u2019t have to understand what they need before they walk through the door.\n\nAnd when other issues come to light \u2014 that perhaps a broken bone was the result of domestic violence, or a cough is the result of years of smoking \u2014 referrals can happen almost instantaneously. It\u2019s called the \u201cno wrong door\u201d philosophy.\n\nBecause of the clinic\u2019s fluidity, it makes sense as a recovery space for opiate addicts. Dr. Matt Perez is trained in SBIRT, short for Screening, Brief Interventions, and Referral to Treatment, a subtle way of coaxing stories out of drug users. As his patients come for more standard maladies, the hope is to catch early stages of use that would not likely come out otherwise.\n\n\u201cDo you use any drugs?\u201d Perez demonstrates, speaking in a soft voice, absent of judgment. \u201cYou do? Let\u2019s talk about that? Are you interested in help? Are you aware that I\u2019m a Suboxone provider?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a gentle nudging. The Neighborcare approach is that people won\u2019t make jumps before they\u2019re ready, that they simply need to be helped along their own path. Many of the patients Perez sees are using prescription drugs, but not heroin yet. Helping people before they get too far down the line is the center\u2019s true specialty. In that respect, Downing is actually an outlier.\n\nWith a grant from the U.S. Health and Human Services Department, Neighborcare is looking to expand its opiate treatment, providing more doctors the resources needed to distribute Suboxone. Dr. Perez is an evangelist for the drug. He\u2019s not an addiction specialist, but takes particular joy in helping those struggling with opiate use, and believes it can work wonders. \u201cThe saves you get are really gratifying,\u201d he says.\n\nSuboxone is quickly replacing Methadone as the most popular drug to treat opiate addiction. According to Downing, Suboxone \u201callows me to be a normal person.\u201d When she uses it, she feels clear headed, alert and, most importantly, no desire to use heroin. Downing has tried Methadone before, but it made her groggy, and she still continued to use heroin while on it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say Methadone worked for maybe 10 percent of the people I knew,\u201d she says. But she says Suboxone works the other 90 percent of those trying to get clean.\n\nMost significantly, Suboxone is discreet. The stigma of Methadone clinics is enough to spark neighborhood conflicts and drive away the people who might need the drug. But Suboxone users can slip in and out of Neighborcare as easily as someone with a flu.\n\nBut the world of Suboxone is a frustrating one. Not only is it expensive, but it\u2019s more challenging to prescribe than the pain medications that can get people addicted to opiates.\n\n\u201cRidiculously, the federal government won\u2019t allow physicians assistants or nurse practitioners to prescribe Suboxone,\u201d says Perez. \u201cThey have unlimited ability to prescribe pain meds, but they can\u2019t use this very safe drug.\u201d\n\nThe last time Downing was clean for an extended period of time was also thanks to Suboxone. It helped her kick the habit for nearly two years. But her insurance shifted and the drug was too expensive to buy out of pocket. She relapsed. She feels more secure this time around thanks to the Affordable Care Act. And Neighborcare, for its part, offers a sliding pay scale to its patients, so if Downing loses insurance, she could likely still find a way to get the drug.\n\nTelling her story, Downing reveals years full of great guilt and great trauma. It\u2019s been a long road. But now she wants another kid. She wants to be a \u201cproductive member of society.\u201d She wants normalcy. None of that includes heroin.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Crosscut", "description": "Hearing the life of Desirae Downing, 33, it\u2019s no wonder she struggles with opiate use.
