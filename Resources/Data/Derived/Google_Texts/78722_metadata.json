Morrissey said the state needs to create and maintain a friendly business environment and create a proper tax environment, generate better schools and eliminate the state income tax and corporate tax.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just bringing people to the state, it\u2019s bringing industry,\u201d he said.\n\nDial said the area needs to attract more high-quality jobs.\n\n\u201cWhen we focus on high-quality jobs we have to worry less about people coming on to public services,\u201d he said.\n\nDial also said the education system is essential to the community and needs to continue making improvements; higher-education students should graduate in five years, children need to read by the third grade and money should go directly to schools\u2019 needs rather than bureaucracies.\n\nIn regards to Common Core standards and the state\u2019s decision to cancel Arizona\u2019s membership with the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers test, Dial and Morrissey spoke of the standards they believe schools should uphold.\n\n\u201cYou want to have high expectations and you want to have great teachers. If you have those two things, everything else is kind of paperwork and busywork,\u201d Dial said.\n\nLocal control, rather than \u201cfederal overreach\u201d of the education system was another point Dial emphasized and said coordination between parents, teachers and administrators is the best way to improve the school system.\n\nMorrissey said he opposes Common Core, calling it \u201ccreeping socialism.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is disastrous to our education system. It\u2019s an overreach by the federal government that\u2019s being allowed,\u201d he said.\n\nRather, Morrissey said school districts should hire and hold accountable good teachers and principals, eliminating the time allocated to reporting student success as defined by Common Core. Morrissey said he has relations who are retired teachers and has talked to a number of educators to form the base of his policy.\n\nThe candidate were asked about Gov. Jan Brewer\u2019s contentious approval to expand Medicaid.\n\nThe decision was made in the dark of night, Morrissey said, and \u201cthat\u2019s not the way we do business in Arizona.\u201d He said the decision immortalized \u201cObamacare\u201d in Arizona and transferred hospital costs to taxpayers, causing exorbitant fees.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t solve problems by throwing money and I understand there is a problem with funding our health care \u2026 but there may be better ways of doing it,\u201d Morrissey said.\n\nDial said the state had to choose between two options for Medicaid funding; drain the state\u2019s rainy-day fund or accept federal funds. As the state was already using federal funds and rainy-day money would soon be depleted, Dial said he felt the decision was easy, but not fun, and it was the fiscally conservative thing to do.\n\n\u201cIt was absolutely the right decision,\u201d Dial said, \u201cthe voters in \u201996 and 2000 told the state we were going to fund Medicaid.\u201d\n\nThis is the free-market way to do it, Dial said, as \u201cwe have the fourth-lowest-cost program in the nation.\u201d\n\nThe adequacy of legislative pay will be determined by voters this year as an $11,000 pay increase for lawmakers will appear on the ballot. Dial said he said he is fine with the pay as is but added it is up to the voters to decide the issue, while Morrissey said he believes pay should not increase as the position should be for the honor, not the money.\n\nAt the end of the debate, the candidates had the opportunity to summarize their campaigns.\n\n\u201cI will go beyond the scope of throwing money at problems, I will look for solutions,\u201d Morrissey said, adding that leaders must emerge to find solutions and should not be afraid of being controversial and speaking out. He also said citizens and lawmakers need to embrace the constitution to find a solution for the recent influx of immigrants.\n\nDial said he is happy with what he has been doing with education and directing funds directly to the classroom but says he is frustrated with border control and human trafficking and that the state needs to further address those problems.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re looking at those things we\u2019re accomplishing, we\u2019re making Arizona more competitive when it comes to our tax structure here in the state\u2026 working on education, working on jobs,\u201d he said.\n\nThe primary election is scheduled for Aug. 26. The winner of the Republican primary will face Democrat Janie Hydrick in the general election Nov. 4. District 18 encompasses Ahwatukee, and portions of Tempe, Chandler and Mesa.\n\nDial is a Chandler resident and was elected to the Arizona House of Representatives in 2010. He is the chairman of the Higher Education and Workforce Development Committee and serves on the Financial Institutions Committee and the Technology and Infrastructure Committee. He was a sponsor for the Arizona Jobs Bill and co-founded the House Jobs Forum.\n\nMorrissey is originally from Brooklyn, N.Y., and moved to Ahwatukee in 1986. He served as the chief deputy U.S. Marshal for Arizona and worked as the chief of the Department of Economic Security\u2019s Office of Special Investigations to stop fraudulent activities committed by individuals and businesses.\n\nScroll down to \"more coverage\" to see clips from the forum.\n\n\u2022 Sam Gauvain is a junior at ASU\u2019s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication.
