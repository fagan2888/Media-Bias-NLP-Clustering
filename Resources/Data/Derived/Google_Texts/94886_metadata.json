As his teammates struggled to score in the first 2 1/2 innings, Lane was relentless from the first inning to the last.\n\n\"I came into this game looking at it as just another game,\" said Lane. \"I did what I knew I could. I threw strikes, tried to get ahead in the count, tried not to get nervous and tried to do what I knew i could do.\"\n\nBoatner said that in a senior class that holds six future college baseball players, Lane -who signed with MCC in the winter- sometimes got lost in the shuffle.\n\n\"Blake Anderson and Will Stokes get a lot of publicity, but we said all along, Ryan Lane is right there with him.\"\n\nStokes watched Lane pitch from the shortstop position in game two.\n\n\"He did awesome. He always does awesome,\" said Stokes \"I expected nothing less in this game, and he came through.\"\n\nNext year, Lane will be an Eagle, and Stokes will suit up for Ole Miss, but on that warm night in Trustmark Park, nothing else seemed to matter except celebrating with teammates and living in the moment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Playing small ball helped West Lauderdale bring the school its 13th baseball state championship.
