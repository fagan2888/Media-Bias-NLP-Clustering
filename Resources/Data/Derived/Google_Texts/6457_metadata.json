So on Monday, Fox went into a spin cycle to make sure that nobody thinks ill of a billionaire looking for ways to dodge his civic debt while running for president.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just being honest here,\u201d host Neil Cavuto said in response to Trump\u2019s declaration. Cavuto also claimed that Trump\u2019s message \u201cappears to be resonating despite the play it\u2019s gotten in the media that he\u2019s some sort of a selfish Scrooge.\u201d\n\nCavuto hosted two Republican strategists to debate zero Democrats for Fox\u2019s idea of a \u201cfair and balanced\u201d discussion.\n\nGuest Cheri Jacobus claimed everybody watching Trump on Sunday said to themselves, \u201cI want Donald Trump to do my taxes.\u201d She called his tight-fistedness \u201cgood business.\u201d She added, \u201cSecondly, we do see how the government is wasting our money. We saw it with what Obamacare has done to businesses as well as individuals. We\u2019ve seen the wasted stimulus package, and it sounds like a smart businessman. \u2026This is probably the one case where being a businessman, as opposed to somebody who\u2019s held office, can pay off.\u201d\n\nGuest Lisa Boothe was just as enthusiastic. \u201cI\u2019d say amen to this. He\u2019s absolutely right.\u201d She also tried to blame President Obama for Trump\u2019s stinginess. \u201cLook, the federal government spends too much, taxes too much, and regulates too much\u2026 and it\u2019s really happening under President Obama.\u201d\n\nJacobus added, \u201cUnited States has the highest corporate tax rate of anybody when you average in the state taxes on top of that. So it\u2019s good business to want to pay as little as possible. \u2026Maybe he can be a good Secretary of Treasury.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the U.S. effective corporate tax rate is lower than that of big industrial nations. But Cavuto did not point that out.\n\n\u201cBusinesses have been pummeled under the Obama economy. They\u2019ve been hit with higher taxes, higher regulations, and the government is spending too much,\u201d Boothe claimed. Nobody mentioned that the stock market has hit all-time highs during Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\nBut Cavuto said, \u201cSo Donald Trump is saying what people are thinking, right?\u201d\n\n\u201dAbsolutely, what we\u2019re all thinking,\u201d Jacobus agreed. \u201cI think he\u2019s driving the debate right now.\u201d\n\nAccording to Forbes, Trump\u2019s net worth is $4 billion. He can surely pay his fair share of taxes and not starve to death.\n\nWatch the PR job below, from the August 3 Your World.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "bH20jWTq2Lmae/OdA+/0Ho4b23qOYDEQkkl3AlEqC4M=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/fox_news_gushes_over_trump_s_meager_tax_paying_0801415", "type": "article", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "title": "Fox News Gushes Over Trump\u2019s Meager Tax Paying"}, "Title": "Fox News Gushes Over Trump\u2019s Meager Tax Paying"}, "article_summary": "Donald Trump boasted on Sunday\u2019s Face The Nation, \u201cI fight like hell to pay as little as possible\u201d in taxes.\nBut Cavuto said, \u201cSo Donald Trump is saying what people are thinking, right?\u201d\u201dAbsolutely, what we\u2019re all thinking,\u201d Jacobus agreed.\n\u201cHe\u2019s just being honest here,\u201d host Neil Cavuto said in response to Trump\u2019s declaration.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s driving the debate right now.\u201dAccording to Forbes, Trump\u2019s net worth is $4 billion.\n\u2026Maybe he can be a good Secretary of Treasury.\u201dIn fact, the U.S. effective corporate tax rate is lower than that of big industrial nations."}
