Jeb\u2019s implosion is partially responsible for this, but there is also a belief on the Right that Rubio is the best \u201cmainstream\u201d candidate in the field. If that\u2019s true, if Rubio represents moderate conservatism, the GOP is in serious trouble.\n\nApart from his fresh face, virtually nothing about Rubio is new or endearing. His ideas are either conventionally Republican or uncommonly extremist. On foreign policy, Rubio is a rabid neoconservative. He wants to double down on the Bush Doctrine; he\u2019s surrounded himself with neocon advisers; he supports the government\u2019s unconstitutional surveilance program; he\u2019s pro-torture; and he wants to dramatically increase defense spending even though America spends more on defense than the next eight nations combined.\n\nOn domestic and social issues, Rubio is no less extreme. Against the backdrop of record inequalities, he wants to reduce federal revenue and give the top 1% a massive tax cut (which would explode the budget). Like every other Republican, he wants to repeal Obamacare without offering a viable alternative to the millions of Americans who now have health coverage. He supports a ban on all abortions, including cases of rape and incest. And he wants to undo Obama\u2019s executive orders protecting LGBT citizens from marriage discrimination.\n\nThursday night\u2019s debate was yet another illustration of Rubio\u2019s faux moderation. If you cut through the canned rhetoric and listen closely to what he\u2019s saying, Rubio sounds like a meat-tossing fanatic. His mini-monologues are either outrageous or patently false. In his opening remarks, Rubio trotted out his line about Obama hating America: \u201cYou see, we usually elect presidents in America that want to change the things that are wrong with America. Barack Obama wants to change America. Barack Obama wants America to be like the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nWhat does that even mean? President Obama has said repeatedly that his story is only possible in America; that he symbolizes the American dream. This is the kind of platitudinous drivel that Rubio spews on the stump. Rubio added that Obama \u201csystematically and habitually violates the constitution\u201d and yet never explains what he means by that. It\u2019s just red meat for the Obama-hating dolts in the audience.\n\nRubio\u2019s remarks about terrorism and foreign policy were characteristically hysterical \u2013 and dishonest. \u201cWhen I\u2019m president,\u201d he declared, \u201cwe are going to rebuild our intelligence capabilities. And they\u2019re going to tell us where the terrorists are. And a rebuilt U.S. Military is going to destroy these terrorists. And if we capture any of these ISIS killers alive, they\u2019re going to Guantanamo Bay Cuba, and we\u2019re going to find out everything they know.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Don't be fooled, Marco Rubio represents the worst instincts of movement conservatism", "title": "Marco Rubio is not a moderate: If the Florida senator represents mainstream conservatism, the GOP is screwed", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Don't be fooled, Marco Rubio represents the worst instincts of movement conservatism", "title": "Marco Rubio is not a moderate: If the Florida senator represents mainstream conservatism, the GOP is screwed", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/29/marco_rubio_is_not_a_moderate_if_the_florida_senator_represents_mainstream_conservatism_the_gop_is_screwed/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/gop-2016-debate.jpeg17-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Don't be fooled, Marco Rubio represents the worst instincts of movement conservatism", "title": "Marco Rubio is not a moderate: If the Florida senator represents mainstream conservatism, the GOP is screwed", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/gop-2016-debate.jpeg17-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sean Illing", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, aol_on, fox news debate, Marco Rubio, Republican Party", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: 2016 Elections, aol_on, fox news debate, Marco Rubio, Republican Party, Elections News, News, Politics NewsMarco Rubio has become the darling of the Republican establishment.\nBarack Obama wants America to be like the rest of the world.\u201dWhat does that even mean?\nAnd if we capture any of these ISIS killers alive, they\u2019re going to Guantanamo Bay Cuba, and we\u2019re going to find out everything they know.\u201d\nIf that\u2019s true, if Rubio represents moderate conservatism, the GOP is in serious trouble.\nIf you cut through the canned rhetoric and listen closely to what he\u2019s saying, Rubio sounds like a meat-tossing fanatic."}
