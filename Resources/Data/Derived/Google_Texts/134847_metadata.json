Representative Tom Price, a Georgia Republican and a strong conservative, will be writing the House\u2019s budget next year, while Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin moves to the Ways and Means Committee, which originates tax bills and has the dominant role in health care legislation.\n\nBoth men argue that the budget office should use more \u201cdynamic scoring\u201d when assessing the cost of tax cuts, saying the impact on the Treasury would be mitigated greatly by the additional economic growth they contend the cuts would engender.\n\nSuch a change in scorekeeping, based on the supply side theory popular among conservatives, would ease the push to overhaul the tax code and produce an ostensibly balanced budget while lowering top individual and corporate tax rates.\n\nThat has Democrats worried.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re bringing in a C.B.O. director with the intention of getting someone who\u2019s going to apply voodoo economics to the budget, that\u2019s a real problem,\u201d said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee. \u201cIf they\u2019re looking for someone who is going to cook the books, that\u2019s a real problem.\u201d\n\nSo far, no director has taken the C.B.O. down a partisan rabbit hole.\n\n\u201cEvery time, people worry about politicization,\u201d said Mr. Holtz-Eakin, who has become increasingly aligned with conservative politics since leaving the budget office. \u201cIt is in the statute that it be nonpartisan, and I generally don\u2019t fall out of bed wanting to break the law. And it\u2019s in the DNA of the staff.\u201d\n\nMs. Rivlin said it was possible for a director to warp the institution, asserting more partisan leadership, prompting staff departures and replacing them with more partisan appointments.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut, she said, \u201cIt never has, because both parties have appointed directors who understand the mission of C.B.O. is to be very nonpartisan and have made an effort to not inject their own views into the picture.\u201d\n\nThis transition has been more perilous than most. Mr. Elmendorf has told congressional leaders and committee chairmen that he wants another term. But aides close to the budget committees say the incoming leadership is looking at a host of new names.\n\nThe Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call has already floated possible replacements. Some, like Jeffrey R. Brown of the University of Illinois and Katherine Baicker of Harvard University, are respected Republican academic economists. Others are more partisan, such as Warren Payne, the House Ways and Means Committee\u2019s Republican policy director; J. D. Foster, the deputy chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, formerly of the Heritage Foundation; and James C. Capretta, a frequent contributor to National Review.\n\nThat list prompted an outpouring of concern among an eclectic group of economists on the right. N. Gregory Mankiw of Harvard, a former chairman of George W. Bush\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, called for Mr. Elmendorf\u2019s reappointment on his blog: \u201cI understand that G.O.P. leaders may be tempted to put their own stamp on the Congressional Budget Office. But sometimes the benefits of continuity transcend ideology and political affiliation.\u201d\n\n\u201cDynamic scoring is more realistic, because the path of the economy responds to changes in tax policy,\u201d Mr. Mankiw said in an email response to questions last week. \u201cThe problem is that there is substantial disagreement about which models are most appropriate for estimating those responses. Static scoring makes the clearly wrong assumption that tax policy does not influence the economy, but it has the virtue of being less model-dependent and thus more easily understood.\u201d\n\nCasey B. Mulligan, a conservative economist at the University of Chicago, laid out his \u201creasons to continue the Elmendorf era.\u201d Keith Hennessey, a top Bush adviser, weighed in, as did Charles Murray and Alan D. Viard of the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nStill, like his counterparts in the House, the incoming Senate Finance Committee chairman, Orrin G. Hatch, also believes the C.B.O. should be taking another stab at dynamic scoring. Currently, the budget office and the White House Office of Management and Budget use \u201cstatic scoring\u201d on most bills, assessing the cost of tax cuts and spending bills primarily as simple subtraction from revenue or addition to spending totals.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with C.B.O. and O.M.B. doing both a static report and a dynamic report?\u201d Mr. Hatch asked. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid to do the one and not do the other.\u201d\n\nGiven that perspective among prominent Republicans and continuing conflict over the Affordable Care Act, congressional aides say the betting is against Mr. Elmendorf, whose positive assessments of the cost and impact of the health care law have angered conservative activists for years. His replacement, they say, would signal that Republicans are serious about change.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141201202333, "twitter": {"description": "Ardent conservatives have laid out their cases against Douglas Elmendorf\u2019s reappointment to the nonpartisan post, while other Republicans support him.", "title": "G.O.P.
