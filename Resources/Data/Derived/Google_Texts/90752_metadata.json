Sales in Manhattan, Los Angeles, San Francisco, London and other global hubs are stabilizing after having rocketed in 2013, when many buyers cashed in on stock market gains. Now, multi-millionaires and billionaires are seeking estates overseas and at resort destinations, the report said.\n\nThe dollar has appreciated 20 percent against the euro in the past year, making pied-a-terres in Paris and wineries in Bourdeaux more affordable for wealthy Americans. Sales are also surging by averages of more than 20 percent along the beaches of Turks and Caicos and the slopes of Telluride, Colo.\n\nFive homes sold around the world for more than $100 million in 2014, and a record 18 were listed for sale at that level, according to the Christie\u2019s report. Last year\u2019s purchases include a $146 million French Riviera mansion. Each square foot of the home cost $22,577 \u2014 roughly equivalent to a new Honda Accord.\n\nThis is the new top tier for billionaires scouring the globe for signature homes, a market that Conn said should continue to prosper because the world minted 200 new billionaires from 2013 to 2014.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got this club of billionaires who just like to have unique assets,\u201d Conn said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also, truthfully, that they like to entertain their friends and say, \u2018This is mine.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe luxury market contrasts with the still-struggling U.S. real estate market as a whole. Millions of homeowners still owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth \u2014 a vestige of the housing crash that triggered the recession in late 2007. Buyers remain sensitive to changes in mortgage rates and price swings that could make ownership costlier. At the same time, access to credit remains tight for some. Sales have been running below a pace associated with healthy markets.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a deeper cultural shift where people aren\u2019t willing to get a house at any cost,\u201d said Glenn Kelman, CEO of the brokerage Redfin.\n\nExisting homes sold at an annual pace of 5.19 million in March, a sharp increase after a brutal winter curtailed buying in the Northeast, the National Association of Realtors said last week. Kelman warns that that sales pace isn\u2019t sustainable because demand has been driven largely by 30-year fixed mortgage rates averaging just 3.65 percent, compared with a 52-week high of 4.33 percent.\n\nSome luxury developers say the stronger dollar has cut into sales. There has been a 25 percent drop in Manhattan\u2019s monthly sales pace and a 50 percent drop in Miami Beach, said Kevin Maloney, a developer whose firm, Property Markets Group, works on luxury buildings.\n\n\u201cIf I had my druthers, I\u2019d like to see the dollar weaken against other currencies,\u201d Maloney said.\n\nJosh Boak,\n\nThe Associated Press", "article_metadata": {"description": "$100 million for a home?
