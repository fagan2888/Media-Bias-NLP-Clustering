Screen shot/Tobii Eye Experience\n\nIf there's a luxury we wish we had, it's definitely a menu that reads our minds. Enter: Pizza Hut.\n\nThe Washington Post reported the pizza chain has been testing special eye-tracking tablets in 300 locations in the UK since October, in which diners receive pizza reommendations based on the ingredients they stare at longest. There are 20 different ingredients and 4,896 possible combinations. Should your eyes betray you, there's also a restart button.\n\n\"Finally the indecisive orderer and the prolonged menu peruser can cut time and always get it right,\" a Pizza Hut spokesperson said in a statement, \"so that the focus of dining can be on the most important part \u2014 the enjoyment of eating!\"\n\nTobii Technology, an eye technology firm from Sweden, developed the menu for Pizza Hut using retina-scanning development and otherwise psychological research. Testing is still ongoing in the UK, but if it's a hit with diners, there may be an opportunity to expand to the United States in the future.\n\nEven if the tablets are a bust, there's something to be said for chain restaurants keeping up with technology. David C. Novak, the CEO of Yum! Brands, who owns Pizza Hut, told The Post, \"our goal is to not only catch the competition on the digital front, but to surpass it in 2015.\"\n\nSee for yourself how the menu works in the video below.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "pizza, huts, new, menu, picks, out, your, desired, pizza, toppings, even, if, you, dont, know, them", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Pizza Hut's UK chains are testing an eye-tracking tablet that curates a pizza order based on the ingredients stared at longest.
