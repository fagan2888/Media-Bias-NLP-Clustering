Rural crime investigators say thieves stole a miniature horse from a San Bernardino County town and were asking for the public's help Monday in identifying someone seen speeding away in a pickup truck at the time of the crime.

Runner, a 21-year-old registered mini horse, was stolen from the 7600 block of Luna Road in Phelan (map) last Monday, the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department said in a news release.

There were two sightings of a male holding the horse down in the bed of a small or mid-sized pickup truck fleeing toward Adelanto, the release said.

Runner was described as 2-feet-10-inches tall, weighing about 150 pounds and all-black in color.
