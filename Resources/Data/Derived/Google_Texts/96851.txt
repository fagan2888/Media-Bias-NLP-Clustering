UPDATE Friday Jan. 9, 2015: Richard Sherman has been removed as a Free Beacon Man of the Year for his involvement in an Obamacare video.

Richard Sherman talked a bigger game than anybody last year, and he backed it up by winning himself a Super Bowl ring.

After beating the rival San Francisco 49ers, Sherman delivered an epic post-game rant.

The rant will certainly go down as among the best tantrums ever performed on the gridiron, and it wonâ€™t be the last the world hears from Sherman.

This year, Sherman has the Seahawks back to their winning ways and the defense is leading the way. Over the eight-game span leading up to week 17, Seattle has let up an average of just 12.6 points and 233.3 yards per game.

Sherman is still on top of his trash-talk game as well. Before romping the Arizona Cardinals 35-6, he told reporters that if he allowed as many touchdowns as star corner Patrick Peterson that he would get benched.
