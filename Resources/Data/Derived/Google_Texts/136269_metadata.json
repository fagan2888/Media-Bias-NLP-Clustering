When you see that sign posted then you know you should not park there,\" Grant says.\n\nThe fees for parking in one of these spots can add up: $250 dollars for a ticket, $100 dollars for the towing fee, and a $20 dollars per day storage fee.\n\nDuring the last storm, authorities handed out a record $180,000 in fines in what was the city's first snow emergency in four years.\n\nConditions are treacherous\n\nThe word in D.C., Maryland, and Virginia is stay off the roads unless travel is absolutely necessary. Roads are hazardous and the plows need room to work. Here is Joan Morris at the Virginia Department of Transportation.\n\nConditions have been treacherous. They are slowly beginning to improve now that the snow has stopped but the temperatures are so cold we are going to have very slick conditions throughout the night.\n\nValerie Burnette Edgar at the Maryland State Highway Administration says tomorrow morning could be rough, too.\n\nDepending on how early you start your day there could still be some icy conditions out there.\n\nLingering effects for travel, power\n\nAt Reagan National and Dulles Airports, spokesman Rob Yingling says call your airline before heading to the airport, because there have been hundreds of cancellations today.\n\n\"We expect conditions to improve as we go through the afternoon and into the early evening and flight activity to begin to increase,\" he says.\n\nThe city has also warned residents that there may be power outages because of the ice and snow. Residents are urged to call Pepco to report any outages and do not go near any downed wires.\n\nAnd people should also be mindful of a city law that requires residents to clear their sidewalk of snow within eight daylight hours of the storm ending.\n\nAs part of the snow emergency, D.C. taxicabs are allowed to add a $15 surcharge for any rides they give.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Patrick Madden and  Martin Di Caro", "og": {"site_name": "WAMU 88.5", "description": "Metrobus schedule for Tuesday\r\nMetrobus will be operating on a severe snow service plan on Tuesday.
