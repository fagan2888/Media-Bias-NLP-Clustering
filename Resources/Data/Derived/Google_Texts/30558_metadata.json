He said the clashes resulted in causalities, but didn't give a specific number.\n\nAlarmed by the development, Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi ordered the Joint Military Command to \"take all the necessary military measures to control the situation in Tuz Khormato and to avoid the consequences.\"\n\nLocal officials in the town were not available to comment. Tuz Khormato is located about 130 miles (200 kilometers) north of Baghdad.\n\nElsewhere on Sunday, officials said suicide attacks targeting security forces in two Baghdad suburbs killed at least 14 people and wounded dozens.\n\nA suicide car bomb struck a checkpoint in the eastern suburb of Hussainiyah late Saturday night, killing six civilians and four soldiers, a police officer said. He added that another 28 people were wounded in the attack. The Islamic State group claimed the attack in a statement posted on a militant website.\n\nAnother police officer said a suicide car bomb struck a passing military convoy at around the same time in the southern suburb of Arab Jabour, killing four soldiers and wounding eight others.\n\nA day earlier, a suicide attack on a Shiite mosque in the southwestern suburb of Radwaniyah killed 13 worshippers and wounded 35 others, a police officer said.\n\nThree medical officials confirmed the casualty figures from the weekend attacks. All officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to release the information.\n\nIraqi forces backed by U.S.-led airstrikes have pushed IS back on a number of fronts in recent months, clawing back territory seized by the extremists during their sweep across northern and western Iraq in 2014.\n\nBut IS has continued to carry out attacks in and around Baghdad, mainly targeting security forces and the country's Shiite majority.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Murtada Faraj in Baghdad and Maamoun Youssef in Cairo contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Clashes erupt between Kurdish, Shiite fighters in Iraqi town - AP News: BAGHDAD (AP) \u2014 Heavy clashes erupted Sunday between Kurdish peshmerga .05/27/2016 8:01:26AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "BAGHDAD (AP) \u2014 Heavy clashes erupted Sunday between Kurdish peshmerga forces and Shiite paramilitary troops", "title": "AP News - Clashes erupt between Kurdish, Shiite fighters in Iraqi town", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2016/04/24/suicide-attacks-in-iraq-kill-at-least-14-people-n2152991", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016\\115\\d566aa22-6936-4a43-9948-c86faea791db.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "BAGHDAD (AP) \u2014 Heavy clashes erupted Sunday between Kurdish peshmerga forces and Shiite paramilitary troops", "title": "AP News - Clashes erupt between Kurdish, Shiite fighters in Iraqi town", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2016/04/24/suicide-attacks-in-iraq-kill-at-least-14-people-n2152991", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/115/d566aa22-6936-4a43-9948-c86faea791db.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Clashes erupt between Kurdish, Shiite fighters in Iraqi town, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "BAGHDAD (AP) \u2014 Heavy clashes erupted Sunday between Kurdish peshmerga forces and Shiite paramilitary troops inside a contested town north of Baghdad, a spokesman said.\nBut IS has continued to carry out attacks in and around Baghdad, mainly targeting security forces and the country's Shiite majority.\nElsewhere on Sunday, officials said suicide attacks targeting security forces in two Baghdad suburbs killed at least 14 people and wounded dozens.\nA quarrel between two neighbors, a Kurd and a Shiite Turkoman, evolved into a military confrontation between the peshmerga forces and Shiite fighters who share the town of Tuz Khormato, said Karim al-Nouri, the spokesman for Iraq's paramilitary forces \u2014 which are made up mainly of Shiite militias.\nA day earlier, a suicide attack on a Shiite mosque in the southwestern suburb of Radwaniyah killed 13 worshippers and wounded 35 others, a police officer said."}
