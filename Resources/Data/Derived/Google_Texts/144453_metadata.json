There also are self-inflicted wounds: President Bill Clinton\u2019s dalliance with Monica Lewinsky and Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of private e-mail servers while secretary of state.\n\nThey may be on the verge of creating another one: The Clinton Foundation, which has done extraordinary good works over the past 15 years, would present an inherent conflict of interest should she become president, and may be problematic for her even now as a candidate.\n\nClinton has suggested that if she is elected, the foundation \u2014 which collects contributions from wealthy interests including foreign governments \u2014 would continue basically as is. \u201cThe work that it\u2019s done has been extraordinary,\u201d she said in March when asked whether there would be any ethical concerns about continuing the foundation. \u201cThe answer is transparency.\u201d\n\nEthics experts reject that. They say there wouldn\u2019t be any way to avoid the appearance of conflicts if she wins the presidency.\n\n\u201cIf Bill seeks to raise large sums of money from donors who also have an interest in U.S. policy, the public will rightly question whether the grants affected United States foreign policy,\u201d says Stephen Gillers, a legal ethics expert at New York University School of Law. Ethics rules, he notes, are \u201cnot merely to prevent bad behavior but to foster public trust in the integrity of government choices.\u201d He\u2019s open, however, to the idea of the Clintons\u2019 daughter, Chelsea, running the foundation.\n\nBut others say any connection is unacceptable. Joel Fleishman, a foundation expert, says the Clintons have to \u201csever the relationship completely and put it in the hands of independent trustees.\u201d They have to pick a leader of \u201cimpeccable integrity and let it go its own way in raising money,\u201d says Fleishman, who ran a foundation and has written a book on philanthropy.\n\nThe Clinton Foundation and its various offshoots have raised about $2 billion from wealthy individuals, corporations \u2014 especially Wall Street \u2014 and foreign governments. Much of its work is widely praised.\n\nA major initiative provides care to poor people in developing countries, chiefly in Africa, to combat HIV/AIDS and malaria. It has negotiated with pharmaceutical companies for reduced prices for drugs and diagnostic equipment. It also has programs on clean water, food security and climate change. These efforts have encouraged citizen and volunteer involvement.\n\nThis has not been without controversy. Some of the donors have been influence-seekers, including a Canadian businessman who, according to critics, who may have sought to parlay his Clinton connections to reap business benefits with dictators. The foundation also set up a Canadian subsidiary that effectively skirted some disclosure requirements.\n\nAn article in The Wall Street Journal this month raised questions about a financial commitment that the Clinton Foundation made to a for-profit company run by politically connected close friends.\n\nSome of these issues surfaced during Hillary Clinton\u2019s time as secretary of state. It\u2019s a bigger problem now that she\u2019s the leading presidential candidate, and it would be critical if she gets to the White House. The corrective would appear to be to follow Fleishman\u2019s advice, separate totally from the foundation and select an unimpeachable leader. The current president, Donna Shalala, a respected former cabinet member and university president, has not said whether she will stay on beyond the end of this year. Chelsea Clinton would not fit the bill for the post.\n\nTo be sure, Donald Trump would face huge conflicts of his own, particularly regarding his connection to his business empire, but also when it comes to issues involving the U.S. government, such as, for example, a dispute over a Trump golf course overseas or trademark regulations.\n\nPresident Obama, his critics notwithstanding, has run a remarkably scandal-free administration; there have been very few ethical lapses.\n\nThat\u2019s a record that Hillary Clinton, or any next president, should try to emulate. That means separating from the Clinton Foundation.\n\nE-mail Bloomberg View columnist Albert R.
