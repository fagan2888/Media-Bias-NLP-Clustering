Ted Cruz was delivering his normal rhetoric during a New Hampshire speech on Sunday, hitting the current administration on the economy, Obamacare and national security.\n\n\u201cAnd the Obama-Clinton foreign policy of leading from behind \u2014 the whole world is on fire,\u201d the senator from Texas declared.\n\nBut he was stopped by a 3-year-old girl sitting in the front row.\n\n\u201cThe world is on fire?\u201d she yelled out.\n\nCruz took it and ran with it.\n\n\u201cThe world is on fire \u2014 yes! Your world is on fire,\u201d he exclaimed, seizing the moment as the crowd burst out into laughter. \u201cBut you know what? Your mommy\u2019s here and everyone\u2019s here to make sure that the world you grow up in is even better.\u201d\n\nThe scene \u2014 while cute \u2014 captured Cruz\u2019s determination to remain unwavering in his views and language, never backtracking. There was no \u201cjust kidding\u201d or \u201cthat was only a metaphor\u201d to assuage the little girl.\n\nInstead, the first-term senator continued with his speechifying and used the moment to illustrate his point that while things are bad now, they could get better \u2014 especially, cough cough, if he becomes president.\n\nBreaking from the mold\n\nCruz is bringing the resolute disruptor brand that he\u2019s built in Congress out on the trail as he lays the groundwork for a White House bid. This weekend, he was on a two-day swing through New Hampshire, stopping Sunday afternoon at an event put on by the Strafford County GOP.\n\nIn the same way Cruz challenges establishment Republicans in the Senate, he\u2019s trying to build a campaign that breaks from the mold and showcases his firebrand conservatism. For example, his first question from the audience came from a woman who wanted to know how Cruz was going to make campaign finance reform a reality, a huge issue in the first-in-the-nation primary state.\n\nBut Cruz argued that not only is money a form of speech, it emboldens speech. \u201cThe answer is not to muzzle citizens; it\u2019s to empower citizens across the country,\u201d he said.\n\nThrowing a bone to his questioner, however, he said he supports requiring that campaign donations be disclosed.\n\nHe took the same steadfast approach last weekend in Iowa, when he and other contenders were asked about the ethanol mandate requiring that gasoline contain a certain amount of ethanol \u2014 a popular regulation in Iowa where corn is king.\n\nWhile nearly every other potential candidate expressed at least some measure of support for the mandate, Cruz flatly opposed it, saying in front of close to a thousand Iowa farmers that he doesn\u2019t think the government should be involved in the private sector.\n\nGov. Scott Walker, who\u2019s vying with Jeb Bush for frontrunner status, said he supported the mandate in Iowa, despite previously opposing it in his home state of Wisconsin\n\nAsked by reporters Sunday about accusations that Walker is a flip-flopper, Cruz first praised his potential rival but made sure to mention that candidates need to be challenged on their actions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy for candidates to give an answer,\u201d he said, but added: \u201cThe proof is in the pudding. What I\u2019ve urged Republicans to ask of every candidate is: Have you walked the walk? Show me your record.\u201d\n\nCruz got heavy applause when he said he wanted to \u201crepeal every word of Common Core,\u201d a set of testing standards that Jeb Bush staunchly defended when he appeared at a nearby event in Dover, New Hampshire just two days earlier.\n\nCommon Core, however, was not legislation approved by Congress. Rather, it was created by a bipartisan group of governors and state leaders, and states received financial incentives by the government to adopt the standards.\n\nOfficially running? \u2018Stay tuned\u2019\n\nStill, Cruz played somewhat coy with his White House aspirations, aware of the tight federal regulations that would start holding contenders to different standards once they admit they\u2019re running for president.\n\nWhen voters pressed him Sunday to make a White House bid, Cruz told them to \u201cstay tuned.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking at it very, very seriously,\u201d he told the audience. \u201cI would point out a week ago I was in Iowa, yesterday I was in South Carolina, and today I\u2019m in New Hampshire.\u201d\n\nBut he truly charmed the crowd when he said that after he and his wife got their daughters a puppy recently, one of the girls gave her approval for Cruz\u2019s presidential aspirations.\n\n\u201cIf you win, that means Snowflake will finally get a backyard to pee in,\u201d his daughter said, according to Cruz.\n\nIn terms of energy and turnout, Sunday\u2019s event stood out from other events held by potential White House contenders who were in New Hampshire this weekend, in part because it was open to the public, unlike other events headlined by Walker and Bush.\n\nOrganizers were overwhelmed by the number of people who showed up to the Barrington office of Turbocam, a manufacturing company that\u2019s open about its Christian values, to hear Cruz speak. Twenty minutes before it was scheduled to start, organizers had to move the chairs, reporters and speakers to a bigger room to accommodate the 130 to 140 people who showed up.\n\nHis remarks were met with boisterous applause, and he was frequently urged to run for president by people who shook his hand before and after the event.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s D-Day in America folks\u2019\n\nHalfway through Cruz\u2019s remarks, a small-business owner in the audience was called on to ask a question but instead stood up proudly next to the senator and went off into a two-minute rant about how other Republicans in Washington aren\u2019t representing their conservative constituents.\n\n\u201cIt is D-Day in America folks,\u201d he said, getting the crowd on their feet. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait for another Republican. We need Ted Cruz.\u201d\n\nThe man said his wife wrote a blank check for Cruz and pulled out his wallet, only to throw it on the ground at Cruz\u2019s feet.\n\n\u201cFor those who believe in miracles, this gentleman just threw his wallet at a politician,\u201d Cruz said, getting a big laugh from the crowd. \u201cAnd he actually got it back.\u201d\n\nCruz could not accept the money because he\u2019s not yet a candidate.\n\nOne man, Bill Higgins, stood outside in the snow for four hours hoping Cruz would meet his goat named Izak, an apparent fixture on the campaign trail which was wearing a hat that said \u201cI voted\u201d and who happened to bite Jon Huntsman in 2011.\n\nCruz waved hello at Higgins as the senator exited the building Sunday afternoon but didn\u2019t stop to greet the goat.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be back again,\u201d Higgins said, trying to appear unfazed. \u201cI\u2019m sure he wants to get to his next stop.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "https://youtu.be/WtKwtZI9l00?t=1m30s BARRINGTON, New Hampshire -- U.S. Sen.
