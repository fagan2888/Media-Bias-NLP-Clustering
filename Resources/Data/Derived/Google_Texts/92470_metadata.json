Matt Bevin (R) has already blinked on the Medicaid expansion fight, reversing course on the campaign promises he made last year. But as the Lexington Herald-Leader reports , the Tea Party governor unveiled his budget plan yesterday and he\u2019s moving forward with plans to scrap the state\u2019s Kynect health-insurance exchange.\n\nThe Republican governor who took office Dec. 8 was specific in saying that Kynect \u201cis going away\u201d and added that it won\u2019t be in existence a year from now. The exchange offers a website to shop for health coverage. Bevin predicted that a move to the federal exchange, Healthcare.gov, will save the state millions of dollars each year.\n\nKynect is a popular system that\u2019s worked beautifully, but Bevin is determined to scrap it anyway, in part because of knee-jerk partisanship \u2013 \u201cObamacare\u201d is bad, or something \u2013 and in part because the new Republican governor believes the move will save the state money.\n\nExcept, it won\u2019t. State officials have already estimated that dismantling the successful Kynect system will cost taxpayers $23 million\n\nJust as importantly, Kentucky received millions more in federal funds to create Kynect, and the governor\u2019s decision to tear it down means the state will likely have to pay Washington back for the investment Kentucky no longer wants.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, as we discussed a few weeks ago, there\u2019s also an under-appreciated irony to all of this: Bevin, a far-right governor, is also abandoning the tenets of his own ideology. By scrapping Kynect, the Kentuckian is shifting power from his state to Washington, D.C., on purpose, without explanation.\n\nKynect has worked. It\u2019s popular. It saves the state money. And it keeps control in Kentucky instead of D.C. Bevin is overlooking all of this because, well, just because.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "To save money, Kentucky Gov.
