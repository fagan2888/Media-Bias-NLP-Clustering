European Pressphoto Agency\n\nA number of factors explain why young Hondurans could be first in line for a U.S. government plan to allow them to apply for entry as refugees, an idea floated by the White House as a possible means to get control over the flow of Central American migrants to the U.S.\n\nFor starters, the biggest group of unaccompanied minors flooding the U.S.-Mexico border since October come from Honduras, although kids from other Central American nations and Mexico aren\u2019t far behind in making the journey north, according to U.S. government data.\n\nAlso, Honduras also ranks among the world\u2019s most violent societies and as Central America\u2019s poorest, key \u201cpush factors\u201d behind the surge, according to immigration experts.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to pick a country for a pilot program, you can make a good case for Honduras,\u201d said Marc Rosenblum, of the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C., research group.\n\nThe White House hopes that such a program \u2013 which would allow people to apply in their home country \u2013 would discourage people who don\u2019t qualify for refugee status from trying to enter the U.S. on their own, and President Barack Obama cautioned Friday that eligibility for any in-country program would be limited.\n\n\u201cThere may be some narrow circumstances in which there is humanitarian or refugee status that a family might be eligible for,\u201d the president told reporters. \u201cIf that were the case, it would be better for them to be able to apply in-country rather than face a very dangerous journey all the way up to Texas to make those same claims.\u201d The White House didn\u2019t comment on why Honduras could be first, but a senior administration official indicated the program could be quickly expanded.\u201cIf this option is adopted, the first step would be to implement it as a pilot. In looking at how this would work, Honduras has been the example used but if this moves forward, there would be discussions with the other countries focused on doing the same,\u201d the official said. One person involved in the administration\u2019s conversations said Honduras may be first up because its government is more willing to participate. It is not easy for leaders to acknowledge that things are so bad in their countries that people need refugee status to escape, she said. But she said the Hondurans have already begun thinking about their problems in similar terms and looking for solutions.\n\nOf the more 57,000 unaccompanied minors detained at the U.S. Mexico border since October, about 16,500 were Hondurans. Guatemalans weren\u2019t far behind, with 14,000 apprehensions during the same period, followed by 13,300 Salvadorans and 12,600 Mexicans.\n\nPerhaps more to the point, the number of Honduran kids caught this fiscal year was more than double the 6,700 detained in 2013. The number of child migrants from Guatemala and Salvador spiked as well, but to a lesser extent.\n\nHondurans also account for a large chunk of the 55,000 members of \u201cfamily units\u201d \u2014 adults attempting to migrate with children \u2014 detained at the U.S.-Mexico border in the past 10 months. The Border Patrol stopped only 9,350 such people in fiscal year 2013.\n\nHonduras is by far the deadliest country in Central America, which in turn ranks as the corner of the world most affected by criminal violence, according to the United Nations. Honduras\u2019 Caribbean Coast, anchored by the city of San Pedro Sula, is particularly violent and has sent the most migrant children north this year of anywhere in Central America, according to U.S. government figures.\n\n\u201cOf the three countries, Honduras is the one that it\u2019s easiest to see a relationship between the violence and the communities that are sending migrant children,\u201d Mr. Rosenblum added.\n\nHonduras suffered 90 intentional murders per 100,000 people in 2012, according to the latest statistics from the UN\u2019s Office on Drugs and Crime. That\u2019s more than double the rate of El Salvador and Guatemala, each with about 40 murders per 100,000 people, according to the UNODC.\n\nAnalysts note that El Salvador\u2019s murder rate has ticked up this year as a gang truce brokered by the government and the Catholic Church frays. In Honduras, an independent think tank focused on violence at the national university calculated the 2013 homicide rate at about 80 per 100,000 people, as the government deployed the armed forces in some of the country\u2019s bloodiest communities.\n\nIn comparison, Mexico\u2019s murder rate last year declined 12.5% to 19 per 100,000 people, according to the government\u2019s census agency, reflecting an easing of the gangland wars racking large swaths of the country.\n\nPresident Obama called his Mexican counterpart, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, on Thursday to consult ahead of Friday\u2019s meeting with the Central American leaders. Mexico has tightened enforcement near its own southern border in recent weeks, adding a further impediment to the Central American migrants.\n\nLast year, some 3,300 Hondurans were officially classified as refugees, compared with 6,600 Guatemalans, 9,400 Mexicans and 9,600 Salvadorans, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Refugees fled both Guatemala and Salvador during their civil wars in the 1980s and some might not have returned.\n\nMore", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "A number of factors explain why young Hondurans could be first in line for a U.S. government plan to allow them to apply for entry as refugees, an idea floated by the White House as a possible means to get control over the flow of Central American migrants to the U.S.", "title": "Why Honduras Could Be First Under U.S. Refugee Plan", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/07/25/why-honduras-could-be-first-under-u-s-refugee-plan/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DV836_hondur_P_20140725180312.jpg"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "Why Honduras Could Be First Under U.S. Refugee Plan", "description": "A number of factors explain why young Hondurans could be first in line for a U.S. government plan to allow them to apply for entry as refugees, an idea floated by the White House as a possible means to get control over the flow of Central American migrants to the U.S.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Dudley Althaus  and Laura Meckler", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "A number of factors explain why young Hondurans could be first in line for a U.S. government plan to allow them to apply for entry as refugees, an idea floated by the White House as a possible means to get control over the flow of Central American migrants to the U.S.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-07-25T22:08:52-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-141", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/07/25/why-honduras-could-be-first-under-u-s-refugee-plan/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-47811", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "A number of factors explain why young Hondurans could be first in line for a U.S. government plan to allow them to apply for entry as refugees, an idea floated by the White House as a possible means to get control over the flow of Central American migrants to the U.S.", "title": "Why Honduras Could Be First Under U.S. Refugee Plan", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/07/25/why-honduras-could-be-first-under-u-s-refugee-plan/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DV836_hondur_P_20140725180312.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-47811", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-07-25T22:13:09-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda2f9\"", "article_summary": "Also, Honduras also ranks among the world\u2019s most violent societies and as Central America\u2019s poorest, key \u201cpush factors\u201d behind the surge, according to immigration experts.\nOne person involved in the administration\u2019s conversations said Honduras may be first up because its government is more willing to participate.\nHonduras suffered 90 intentional murders per 100,000 people in 2012, according to the latest statistics from the UN\u2019s Office on Drugs and Crime.\nPresident Barack Obamashakes hands with President Juan Orlando Hernandez of Honduras after also meeting with President Salvador Sanchez Ceren of El Salvador, left, and President Otto Perez Molina of Guatemala, second from left, in the White House.\n\u201cThere may be some narrow circumstances in which there is humanitarian or refugee status that a family might be eligible for,\u201d the president told reporters."}
