Stephen Colbert continued failing badly on Friday. Fallon had Trump. Colbert had SJW darling Amy Schumer. The numbers not only weren't close, they were Colbert's worst loss to date.

An estimated 4.5 million viewers tuned in to see Donald Trump’s appearance on NBC’s Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon... With a 1.15 in 18-49 rating, the episode marked Tonight’s highest-rated Friday telecast in 18-49 since February 27 (also a 1.15) and its best Friday in overall viewership since February 20 (4.8 million). The Trump episode marked Fallon’s biggest total-viewer margin (28%) over CBS’s four-day-old The Late Show with Stephen Colbert

Fallon not only beat Colbert among viewers overall, but also among the 18-45 demo that advertisers care about.

Colbert's numbers have been steadily dropping as viewers decide they would rather do anything than actually watch him talk. Or try to tell jokes. And Amy Schumer draws the same redundant mouth breathing SJW audience as Colbert.

Colbert doesn't understand the format or how to operate outside the comfort zone created by his old gig. It's what makes him weaker than Letterman. By next month, CBS will be panicking and trying to retool the show.
