Tom Rooney (R-FL)\n\nRep. Tom Rooney (R-FL) slammed President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law during the weekly GOP address on Saturday, arguing that the Affordable Care Act hurts seniors. \u201cHere\u2019s the reality \u2014 to help pay for his health care law, the president made deep cuts to the successful Medicare Advantage plan, which serves almost 30 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries,\u201d said Rooney, adding that the cuts are causing seniors to lose access to care.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem: Rooney voted for those same cuts on three separate occasions.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act extends Medicare\u2019s solvency for a decade by saving the program $716 billion. Much of these savings are derived from a reduction in historically excessive payments to health care providers that serve the Medicare Advantage program.\n\nEven though these cuts are to provider payments, and not to benefits, Republicans have repeatedly slammed them as Obama\u2019s \u201cMedicare cuts\u201d for seniors \u2014 a line that was used on multiple occasions by Mitt Romney and House Budget Committee Chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) during the 2012 presidential campaign.\n\nBut Ryan has included these very \u201cMedicare cuts\u201d in every GOP budget he\u2019s proposed since the ACA\u2019s passage in 2010. And Rooney, alongside 95 percent of House and Senate Republicans, voted for Ryan\u2019s budgets with their \u201cMedicare cuts\u201d and all in 2011, 2012, and 2013.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Rep.
