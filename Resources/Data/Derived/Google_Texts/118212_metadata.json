But this spectator was yelling \u201cdoper!\u201d at Chris Froome and the liquid couldn\u2019t have been more unwelcome.\n\n\u201cNo mistake, it was urine,\u201d the race leader said.\n\nWhile Stage 14 signaled a double celebration for British cycling, with Froome extending his lead and fellow Briton Stephen Cummings getting a first win for South African team MTN-Qhubeka on Nelson Mandela Day, the unpleasant assault dampened the leader\u2019s mood.\n\nFroome blamed \u201cvery irresponsible\u201d reporters for turning public opinion against him and his Sky team. Just as he did in winning the Tour for the first time in 2013, the Kenya-born Briton has faced pointed questions about his dominant performances \u2014 and those of his teammates \u2014 along with insinuations of doping.\n\nFroome said he spotted the spectator acting bizarrely about a third of the way into the day\u2019s 178-kilometer (111-mile) west-to-east ride from Rodez to Mende. The route through plains and hills on the fringes of the Massif Central region included a detour through the breathtakingly spectacular Tarn gorges.\n\n\u201cI saw this guy just peering around and I thought, \u2018That looks a bit strange,'\u201d he said. \u201cAs I got there he just sort of launched this cup toward me and said (in French) \u2018Doper!\u2019\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s unacceptable on so many levels.\u201d\n\nHis Sky teammate Richie Porte said another person, also seemingly a spectator, thumped him with a \u201cfull-on punch\u201d a few days earlier on a climb in the Pyrenees. Porte suggested journalists may be putting riders in danger by \u201cwhipping up all the rubbish that they are.\u201d\n\nFroome echoed that thinking.\n\n\u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t blame the public for this,\u201d he said. \u201cI would blame some of the reporting on the race that has been very irresponsible.\n\n\u201cIt is no longer the riders who are bringing the sport into disrepute now, it\u2019s those individuals, and they know who they are.\u201d\n\nHe refused to identify specific journalists or reports, but said: \u201cThey set that tone to people and obviously people believe what they see in the media.\u201d\n\nAlthough such assaults remain rare, Froome is not the first rider in Tour history to have been doused by urine, nor is Porte the first to be punched.\n\nStill, the aggression shows how their generation is paying the price for decades of damage done by dopers, none more infamous than Lance Armstrong, who was stripped of seven Tour victories and confessed to systematic cheating after years of lying.\n\nIn the lingering atmosphere of distrust, Froome\u2019s repeated assurances that he is clean have fallen on deaf ears.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately this is the legacy that has been handed to us by the people before us, people who have won the Tour only to disappoint fans a few years later,\u201d Froome said.\n\n\u201cIf this is part of the process we have to go through to get the sport to the better place, obviously I\u2019m here, I\u2019m doing it,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m not going to give up the race because a few guys are shouting insults.\u201d\n\nEspecially when only the Alps loom as the last major obstacle between the 2013 winner and a second victory in Paris on July 26.\n\nOn a fiercely steep final climb to an airfield above Mende, Froome again proved untouchable.\n\nWhile other podium contenders labored up the three kilometers (just under two miles) with an average 10-percent gradient, Froome caught Nairo Quintana and, to show who\u2019s the boss, beat the Colombian with a finishing sprint.\n\n\u201cEvery little second will help,\u201d said Froome. \u201cI thought I might as well give a little nudge for the line, see if I could take another second or two.\u201d\n\nHe took one second from Quintana and more from others who are, in effect, now competing for second and third spot on the Champs-Elysees podium.\n\nTejay van Garderen, the American leader of the BMC team, suffered most on the climb among the big names. From second overall at the start of the stage, he slipped to third and is now 3 minutes, 32 seconds off Froome\u2019s pace. Quintana vaulted from third to second place, but trails Froome by 3:10, a comfortable cushion for the British rider to carry into the Alps in the last week.\n\nCummings\u2019 MTN-Qhubeka team wore special helmets in Mandela\u2019s honor and met Saturday morning to concoct a winning strategy for the day meant to encourage South Africans to emulate his humanitarian legacy and recognize the decades he spent fighting apartheid.\n\n\u201cQhubeka\u201d means \u201cto progress\u201d or \u201cmove forward\u201d in the language of the Nguni people of southern Africa, and the 34-year-old British rider did just that to dash French hopes on the day when France\u2019s President Francois Hollande was visiting the race.\n\nCummings ambushed two French riders, Romain Bardet and Thibaut Pinot, on the short flat section to the airfield after riding at his own pace up the steep final climb where, he said, \u201ceveryone went bananas.\u201d\n\n\u201cPinot and Bardet were just ahead and I used them as the carrot dangling in front of me for motivation,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter reaching the summit together, the French pair made the mistake of dawdling, watching each other and neglecting the danger from Cummings \u2014 who used his speed on the flat to catch them from behind and claim the stage win.\n\n\u201cHe was very crafty,\u201d Bardet said. \u201cVery disappointed.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Fan yelling \u2018Doper!\u2019 hurls urine at Tour de France leader Chris Froome", "title": "Fan yelling \u2018Doper!\u2019 hurls urine at Tour de France leader Chris Froome", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/18/fan-yelling-doper-hurls-urine-at-tour-de-france-leader-chris-froome/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150718_014207_chris-froome.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150718_014207_chris-froome.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-18T10:40:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T22:04:57+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe204a\"", "article_summary": "MENDE, France \u2014 Being doused in liquids by roadside fans goes with the terrain of being a Tour de France rider.\nBut this spectator was yelling \u201cdoper!\u201d at Chris Froome and the liquid couldn\u2019t have been more unwelcome.\nTejay van Garderen, the American leader of the BMC team, suffered most on the climb among the big names.\nFroome blamed \u201cvery irresponsible\u201d reporters for turning public opinion against him and his Sky team.\nFroome said he spotted the spectator acting bizarrely about a third of the way into the day\u2019s 178-kilometer (111-mile) west-to-east ride from Rodez to Mende."}
