Because the Burlington County woman knew that despite 10 months of phone calls, emails and letters, her family still lacked health insurance.\n\n\u201cI feel helpless,\u201d she\u2019d written two months earlier in a plea to Gov. Chris Christie. \u201cHow much longer do we have to wait?\u201d\n\nThe meltdown of the federal government\u2019s website tied to the Affordable Care Act has been well documented. But in New Jersey, something far worse was happening as the state expanded Medicaid access under Obamacare, an NJ Advance Media investigation has found.\n\nIn New Jersey, where so many are surrounded by privilege, an estimated 11,000 people are still trapped in a tangle of digital red tape and a bureaucratic maze. These families are unable to enroll in the state\u2019s Medicaid program, leaving them in limbo for months and, in some cases, almost a year. And unlike the federal government, which has solved many of its website problems, New Jersey has yet to announce any permanent solution.\n\nThe stunning computer failure at the center of New Jersey\u2019s crisis already has forced the exit of one vendor, left countless boxes stuffed with confidential enrollment data piled in the corridors of county offices and forced workers to rekey data into county computers that cannot interface directly with the state\u2019s 1980s-era main system.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone back to the Stone Age,\u201d said Ellen Vidal, president of the Communications Workers of America unit that staffs the Ocean County Board of Social Services. Her county\u2019s Medicaid backlog over the summer hovered at 4,000.\n\nIn short, New Jersey\u2019s plan to have its ambitious computer upgrade ready for the crunch of new Medicaid enrollees under Obamacare ended up \u201ca colossal failure,\u201d said Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors.\n\n\n\nWhile officials try to unravel the mess, some of the state\u2019s most vulnerable and struggling residents are caught in limbo, hesitating even to go to the doctor, say applicants and caregivers alike.\n\nPregnant women skip prenatal care, keeping their fingers crossed they\u2019ll get on the insurance rolls by their due dates. Parents hope the day care center won\u2019t notice their kids are overdue for shots.\n\nAnd many tell NJ Advance Media they simply have given up hope, resigned to remaining uninsured. For them, the public health safety net remains nothing more than a distant promise.\n\nIn response to the continued problems, last month state officials terminated a $118.3 million contract with Hewlett-Packard, the firm hired to develop an updated online system designed to link all public welfare programs run by the state and the counties.\n\nIS YOUR FAMILY NEW TO MEDICAID? \u2022 We'd love to hear how it's going. Have you been satisfied with the care you've received? Let us know by contacting Kathleen O'Brien at kobrien@njadvancemedia.com or at (732) 902-4557.\n\nThe contract was to have produced a state-of-the-art system for New Jersey to process all its social service aid programs, from Medicaid to food stamps and child-care assistance. It was to have been able to communicate in real time with federal data hubs as well. An April 2013 state newsletter boasted the \u201ccutting edge\u201d system would be \u201cup to the task.\u201d\n\nInstead, a new report from the Office of the State Auditor called the project rife with \u201cpersistent delays and defects.\u201d To make matters worse, the contract lacks clauses to protect taxpayers, State Auditor Stephen Eells testified last week.\n\nThat project\u2019s continued problems mean applications are handled by an antiquated mainframe computer from the 1980s \u2014 or, in the case of Medicaid, partly by hand.\n\nIn the county welfare offices, workers laboriously retype information from paper applications into older software programs. And none of those programs links directly into the centralized state system, according to a state audit.\n\nBecause of the setback, New Jersey still can\u2019t receive full application files from the federal website, HealthCare.gov, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nInstead, New Jersey is one of only four states still relying on abbreviated federal files fraught with inaccuracies, from incomplete ZIP codes to unverified incomes.\n\nThat means workers at the county welfare offices must spend additional time tracking the missing information before the person can become enrolled.\n\nState officials, however, point to a flood of new enrollees as proof the system is functioning.\n\n\u201cNew Jersey has successfully enrolled over 300,000 adults into the Medicaid expansion since October 2013,\u201d said Nicole Brossoie, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Human Services. \u201cThe online application for Medicaid/NJ FamilyCare is short and easy to complete.\u201d\n\nAs for Hewlett-Packard, a spokesman would say only this: \u201cOut of respect, HP does not comment on customer relationships.\u201d\n\nPopular program\n\nNew Jersey is one of 28 states that accepted federal money allocated by Obamacare to expand Medicaid, the public health insurance originally designed mostly for poor women and children. The income ceiling for aid was raised so a family of four earning up to $31,716 can now qualify for insurance. Adults without children are also eligible.\n\nThe expansion has been popular here. At last count, Medicaid enrollment has grown by 25 percent in the past year, bringing the state rolls to 1,666,558 \u2014 or over a sixth of the state\u2019s population.\n\nHowever, when the Hewlett-Packard project failed to be completed in time for the launch of Obamacare last fall, those new applications taxed an already fragile hodge-podge of computer resources.\n\nStaffers said Medicaid applications were separated from the old system with the intent they\u2019d be handled by the new system, called the Consolidated Assistance Support System, or CASS.\n\nThe logjam resulted in applicants postponing medical care or simply doing without it, according to health care professionals and the applicants themselves. While hospitals and federally funded clinics are required to treat patients as if they are insured, private doctors have no such obligation.\n\nIn preparation for Medicaid\u2019s expansion, the federal government wanted states to determine eligibility in a uniform way. This required many states to adjust their computer software. The health care reform law even included money for that.\n\n\u201cSome states had a pretty good experience, and some states saw a colossal failure. And New Jersey was one of those states where it was a colossal failure,\u201d said Salo of the National Association of Medicaid Directors.\n\n\u201cWhen it became clear it was not going to work, the folks in New Jersey just had to pull the plug and say, \u2018All our hopes and dreams are out the window, so we\u2019re in contingency mode.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe computer woes bedeviling the state reflect the complexity of trying to centralize several different aid programs, he said. Toss in Obamacare \u2014 which was passed in 2010, three years into New Jersey\u2019s contract to upgrade its system \u2014 and the failure to be ready in time was almost inevitable, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally not a political thing. There was just a gross underestimation of how long it would take,\u201d he said.\n\nSqueaky wheels get attention\n\nAt county welfare offices, confidential paper applications have been stored wherever there is room. In Essex County, that could be in a hallway or atop a radiator.\n\n\u201cYou literally walk through a maze of boxes and boxes. Try finding a case,\u201d said Tatiana Horton, on the staff of the Essex County Board of Social Services. \u201cIt\u2019s a fire hazard.\u201d\n\nOr they could be stashed under the desk of a worker whose best intention to get to them \u201csome day\u201d never quite happens, said Vidal, of the Ocean County office.\n\nThat makes it almost impossible to know the actual size of the backlog, she said. \u201cThe only way to get a number is to go county by county and look under every worker\u2019s desk,\u201d Vidal said.\n\nAt an advisory council meeting in early October, Valerie Harr, director of the state Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services, indicated the backlog at the county welfare offices was nearly 20,000 cases, with not all counties reporting, according to participants.\n\nAs of the end of October, the backlog reported by the counties was 11,000, according to the department spokeswoman. A request to interview Harr was declined.\n\nSome of those unprocessed applications may be duplicates, as frustrated people who never hear back reapply, said Maura Collinsgru, a health policy advocate with New Jersey Citizen Action. People may apply for Medicaid year-round, not just during the \u201copen enrollment\u201d period.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re growing our own backlog,\u201d she said. Her group believes the size of the backlog remains \u201csignificant.\u201d\n\nGiven the chaos, only the most persistent \u2014 or savvy \u2014 applicants get immediate attention, Horton said.\n\n\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s whoever complains the most. When you get a call from Joe D.\u2019s office, or some politician\u2019s, that\u2019s the application that gets handled,\u201d she said with a shrug, using the nickname of Essex County Executive Joseph DiVincenzo.\n\nDiVincenzo confirmed his office helps constituents with their cases. Medicaid expansion created an \u201cincredible\u201d increase in the number of applications, he said, adding, \u201cWe will continue to work to remediate the problem.\u201d\n\nOthers wait in long lines \u2014 no matter the weather \u2014 to get their cases unraveled. They push strollers, shush toddlers or quietly fiddle with their cellphones to pass the time. When it\u2019s cold, they stomp their feet to stay warm. When it\u2019s raining, they try to avoid getting accidentally poked in the face by the umbrella in front of them.\n\nIn Monmouth County, where the backlog of unprocessed applications is estimated between 1,000 and 1,500, the roster of appointments is filled every day by about 10:30 or 11 a.m., said Billy Dangler, a worker and official with the CWA local there.\n\nBy mid-morning, workers start handing out appointments for the following day, \u201cbecause otherwise they\u2019d be there until 7 or 8 o\u2019clock,\u201d he said.\n\nProblems online\n\nApplying online also carries its own pitfalls.\n\nConvent Station resident Gareth Rees has tried all year to get coverage for his four grandchildren \u2014 yet has mostly failed. His son, a small-business owner, was able to purchase subsidized private insurance for himself and his wife through the Obamacare website. Their children were deemed eligible for NJ FamilyCare, the name of New Jersey\u2019s Medicaid program.\n\nHowever, only one grandson received his insurance card. The other three \u2014 including a grandson who needs $3,000 to $4,000 of medication annually \u2014 inexplicably have not.\n\nRees complained to the offices of both of New Jersey\u2019s U.S. senators, but said he never heard from either.\n\nWhen he next tried to buy private insurance for them himself \u2014 think of it as \u201cGrampaCare\u201d \u2014 he was turned down because he didn\u2019t have authorization from the state.\n\nHaving been warned against submitting a duplicate NJ FamilyCare application, he was suddenly told to do that immediately. This time, however, he plans to avoid the website entirely and do it by paper, using registered mail as an added safeguard.\n\nNot only have the children gone uninsured, but when their parents file their taxes this spring, they\u2019ll likely incur a penalty for violating the ACA law requirement that everyone get insurance.\n\nTo give itself some breathing room, New Jersey joined the ranks of 35 other states that received Washington\u2019s permission to stop checking to see if clients who already have Medicaid are still eligible.\n\nThese annual \u201crecertifications\u201d are normally required to make sure someone hasn\u2019t had a boost in income that would make them ineligible for free health insurance.\n\nState workers worry the waiver to put off recertifications is only creating another future backlog.\n\nFederal officials have chastised other states for amassing large Medicaid backlogs. California, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, Tennessee and Alaska received letters over the summer requesting they submit plans to move the stalled applications through their systems.\n\nBut New Jersey hasn\u2019t received such a letter and probably won\u2019t. While the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has been aware of the state\u2019s computer problems, a spokeswoman called the state \u201cextremely open to suggestions and cooperative in adopting mitigation strategies.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs such, we consider the state\u2019s program to be operational, albeit with a number of manual workarounds, and therefore determined that a formal letter was not needed,\u201d said the spokeswoman.\n\n\u201cThe feds kind of recognize New Jersey is doing the best it can out of a bad situation,\u201d said Salo, of the Medicaid directors\u2019 association. \u201cAt this point, sending them a \u2018nasty-gram\u2019 would just be piling on.\u201d\n\nThe computer failure affects other aid programs besides Medicaid. New Jersey recently ranked 52nd out of 53 jurisdictions for its handling of food stamps, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture official\u2019s letter to the state, and was threatened with the loss of federal funds because of those delays.\n\nAs a result, however, workers were directed to tackle the food stamp application pile. That just took time away from handling the Medicaid backlog, workers reported.\n\nIn the meantime, applicants waited.\n\nThe Blackwells, Aurora and Jonathan, applied for Obamacare policies last January. The two 29-year-olds had been building a nice life for themselves and their two boys in Cinnaminson \u2014 he as a firefighter with full benefits, she as a day care worker \u2014 when he was laid off.\n\nAt first, the parents were told they didn\u2019t qualify for Medicaid because of Jonathan\u2019s unemployment insurance, but the boys would be covered. When no letter of eligibility arrived by March, however, she checked back and learned it had been sent, but lost in the mail. She was told to reapply. She did, in time to meet the national deadline for getting insured.\n\nIn May, when she checked again, she said she was told that second application had been \u201clost.\u201d Again, she was told to reapply \u2014 her third application to an already overwhelmed system.\n\nWith summer ending and her boys way behind on the shots they\u2019d need to attend preschool and day care, she took them to a clinic in Pemberton where the three of them waited four hours, but did get their overdue shots \u2014 nine in all. Payment was on a sliding scale.\n\nBy mid-September, fed up, she wrote Gov. Chris Christie about the run-around she was getting. \u201cLet\u2019s see if the Big Guy actually listens to the small guy,\u201d she recalls thinking.\n\nThen, in mid-October, came her older son\u2019s illness. When her home remedies failed, she took him to the emergency room, where he was treated without having to be admitted. The bill: $4,345, which they cannot pay.\n\nThat ER visit should be covered retroactively by NJ FamilyCare \u2014 which finally sent her the boys\u2019 insurance cards in November \u2014 but she hasn\u2019t received anything in writing to that effect.\n\nAnd as the cap on a long year of fighting red tape, in early November she received a letter from the Burlington County Board of Social Services denying Medicaid to her and her husband. It was a response to their second application, the one filed in March.\n\n\u201cReally? March?\u201d she asked, her voice a mixture of incredulity and weariness. \u201cIt just makes me laugh.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis article was undertaken as a project for the National Health Journalism Fellowship program of the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg School of Journalism.\n\n\n\nKathleen O'Brien may be reached at kobrien@njadvancemedia.com, or at (732) 902-4557.
