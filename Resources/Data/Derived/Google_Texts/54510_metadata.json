But with all the holiday cheer involved, there are several indications Santa Claus is NOT Native American.\n\nHe Still Has All His Reindeer\n\nConsidering a popular Inupiat recipe is reindeer stew, and none of the stories tell of Santa ever enjoying this particular dish, this is a sure-fire indicator he is not Native.\n\nIt\u2019s Just Him and Mrs. Claus\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t know of any Native people without a plethora of cousins, grandkids, brothers, sisters or other family members hanging around their house\u2014sharing food or gossip or sleeping on the couch. He\u2019s also never invited any of us over during powwow season.\n\nJust Cookies\u2014Never Frybread\n\nCookies are great and all when delivering presents, but he\u2019s never asked for frybread?\n\nNo Bumper Stickers on Sleigh\n\nYou know you can spot another Native family by the Native-oriented bumper stickers all over the car. These stickers say things like, \u201cHomeland Security since 1491,\u201d \u201cIndians Discovered Columbus\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m Native American and I discovered your house!\u201d Santa has none of these on his sleigh! Not even a powwow sticker!\n\nLong Hair, But No Braids\n\nAll that long hair and no braids? A Native Santa would definitely represent, he\u2019d probably be a two-braid boy.\n\nThat Full Beard\n\nNo partially grown scruff, no hairless patches, no wiry-looking wannabe facial hair, Saint Nick has a full glorious beard. Nuff said.\n\nThe Clincher: Santa Is Always On Time\n\nNo Indian time excuses, no showing up late once things have got started. Santa Claus delivers. If this doesn\u2019t convince you, nothing will.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We\u2019ve heard all the stories of jolly old Saint Nick sneaking into our houses, eating cookies, leaving presents under the tree\u2014but could he be Native?", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/12/25/7-reasons-santa-claus-not-native-152836", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/santa-claus-glasses.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "7 Reasons You Know Santa Claus Is Not Native"}, "dcterms.date": "2013-12-25T10:00-05:00", "dc": {"title": "7 Reasons You Know Santa Claus Is Not Native"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/12/25/7-reasons-santa-claus-not-native-152836", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Santa Claus, Christmas, Reindeer", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "7 Reasons You Know Santa Claus Is Not Native"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1f9f\"", "article_summary": "A Native Santa would definitely represent, he\u2019d probably be a two-braid boy.\nThat Full BeardNo partially grown scruff, no hairless patches, no wiry-looking wannabe facial hair, Saint Nick has a full glorious beard.\nBut with all the holiday cheer involved, there are several indications Santa Claus is NOT Native American.\nNo Bumper Stickers on SleighYou know you can spot another Native family by the Native-oriented bumper stickers all over the car.\nThese stickers say things like, \u201cHomeland Security since 1491,\u201d \u201cIndians Discovered Columbus\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m Native American and I discovered your house!\u201d Santa has none of these on his sleigh!"}
