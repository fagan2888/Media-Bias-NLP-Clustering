There are no exceptions. As a community we are stronger when we are healthier and we, at the city, are happy to do our part to make sure all of our citizens are covered.\u201d\n\nThe move comes as the city was chosen by the White House as one of 20 to take part in a contest to sign up the most people for insurance under the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare.\n\nThe winning city will get a visit from President Barack Obama.\n\nCities were chosen for the Healthy Communities Challenge based on the percentage and number of uninsured residents and also on levels of diversity and poverty.\n\nMore than 77,000 Hillsborough residents are now insured through the Affordable Care Act, according to Enroll America, an independent nonprofit, nonpartisan group that works to get more people insured.\n\nStill, roughly 15 percent of county residents have no insurance. The percentage rises among minority populations, with 19 percent of black and 21 percent of Hispanic residents having no insurance.\n\ncodonnell@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7871\n\nTwitter: codonnellTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Thu, 26 Nov 2015 17:48:20 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 For the third straight year, Tampa is planning to make it easier for residents to get health insurance through the Affordable Healthcare Act by opening up recreation centers for enroll", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 For the third straight year, Tampa is planning to make it easier for residents to get health insurance through the Affordable Healthcare Act by opening up recreation centers for enroll", "title": "Health care navigators to offer assistance at five Tampa sites", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/health/health-care-navigators-to-offer-assistance-at-five-tampa-sites-20151126/", "image": {"width": 3264, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20151126/ARTICLE/151129489/AR/0/AR-151129489.jpg", "height": 2274}, "updated_time": "2015-11-27T09:01:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 For the third straight year, Tampa is planning to make it easier for residents to get health insurance through the Affordable Healthcare Act by opening up recreation centers for enro", "title": "Health care navigators to offer assistance at five Tampa sites", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20151126/ARTICLE/151129489/AR/0/AR-151129489.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2015-11-26T17:48:20Z-04", "modified_time": "2015-11-27T09:01:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "For the third straight year, Tampa is planning to make it easier for residents to get health insurance through the Affordable Healthcare Act by opening up recreation centers for enrollment.\nThe following recreation centers will be open from 4 to 7 p.m. on Tuesday and Thursdays through Jan. 31 for health care enrollment: \u2022 Cyrus Green Center, 2101 E.
