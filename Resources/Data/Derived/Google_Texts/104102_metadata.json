Sometimes, though, they bring solutions in search of a problem the courts can create. The plaintiffs in Evenwel v. Abbott have gone even further: Their case brings the U.S. Supreme Court a problem and asks the Court to create more problems, with no solution in sight. They want the Court to completely upend the current system of drawing legislative districts\u2014in a way that would give more power to conservative voters and candidates. Beyond that, they are asking the Court to adopt a new constitutional rule with no constitutional provision attached. Latest from Politics The Edge: Trump\u2019s Magic Number Evenwel, which the Court will hear next Tuesday, is a challenge by a group of registered Texas voters to the state\u2019s plan of districts for the state senate. The Texas legislature drew its new districting plan on the assumption that it should try to make each district roughly equal in population to every other. The plaintiffs in Evenwel challenged that plan, however, on the grounds that the legislature should use eligible voters, rather than total population, as the relevant measure. Each district, in other words, should have roughly the same number of eligible voters, not the same number of people. The change would produce a political earthquake. Eligible voters as a group are older (no children under 18, to begin with), wealthier, and more Republican\u2014and, even more important in Texas, whiter and more Anglo\u2014than the population at large. Many people in the Southwest\u2014both legal residents and undocumented immigrants\u2014are not citizens. Under the proposed Evenwel rule, only those eligible to vote count.\n\nThe plaintiffs cite two seminal cases, Baker v. Carr and Reynolds v. Sims, which together are considered (in shorthand) to have established a rule that districting must be done on a \u201cone person one vote\u201d rule. \u201cThe Court,\u201d the plaintiffs argue, \u201cneed not look beyond these seminal decisions to resolve the question presented in Appellants\u2019 favor.\u201d Indeed, the appellants hope the Court won\u2019t look beyond them\u2014because the proposed rule is anchored in scattered language from those opinions, not in the constitutional principle they drew from. In Baker, the Court held for the first time that a state\u2019s legislative districts, if drawn unequally, could be challenged under the Equal Protection Clause. In Reynolds, the Court for the first time struck down a state legislative-districting plan because it drew districts unequal in population. Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote for the six justices that \u201cthe weight of a citizen's vote cannot be made to depend on where he lives.\u201d For this reason, he continued, \u201cPopulation is, of necessity, the starting point for consideration and the controlling criterion for judgment in legislative apportionment controversies ... We hold that, as a basic constitutional standard, the Equal Protection Clause requires that the seats in both houses of a bicameral state legislature must be apportioned on a population basis.\u201d In a later case, the Court held that Hawaii could use registered voters rather than raw population as the basis for its districts. The majority reached that conclusion because the state had an unusually high number of transient military personnel and tourists\u2014and \u201conly because on this record it was found to have produced a distribution of legislators not substantially different from that which would have resulted from the use of a permissible population basis.\u201d The Hawaii case, Burns v. Richardson, has been read to mean that states have a choice of basis, as long as its plan remains close to overall population numbers. The plaintiffs want to replace that loose rule with a no-choice \u201celigible voter\u201d requirement. They want the Court to read some of its previous language aggressively (\u201cthe weight of a citizen\u2019s vote\u201d) and to ignore other language (\u201dPopulation is ... the starting point ... and the controlling criterion\u201d).\n\nOne would hardly know it from the appellants\u2019 brief, but the basis of all the Court\u2019s districting cases is the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. That provision protects the rights of \u201cpersons\u201d within a state\u2019s jurisdiction. The framers of the clause knew the difference between \u201cpersons,\u201d \u201ccitizens,\u201d and voters: Elsewhere in Section One they guarantee the \u201cprivileges or immunities\u201d of \u201ccitizens of the United States,\u201d rather than of \u201cpersons\u201d; in Section Two they discuss the right to vote of some, but not all, \u201ccitizens of the United States.\u201d The Evenwel \u201crule\u201d has been patched together more or less out of thin air, supplemented by a highly partial reading of a few Warren Court cases. As for representation, Article I requires representatives to be divided among the states \u201caccording to their respective numbers,\u201d meaning population. There was no exception for non-citizens, or for children; slaves were also counted, though only as three-fifths of \u201cfree persons.\u201d The Fourteenth Amendment did away with the three-fifths rule, basing House seats on \u201cthe whole number of persons in each State\u201d\u2014population again. The amendment makes an exception\u2014when eligible male citizens (women were not guaranteed the right to vote until 1919) are denied the vote on any basis, states were to lose House seats for all members of the denied group. This provision was never applied, but I read it to mean that if, say, adult male voters were denied the ballot because they were African American, the state would lose representation for its entire African American population\u2014men, women, and children. I find no hint anywhere in the text that the boundaries of political power could or should ignore children, or women (who were then ineligible to vote), or non-citizens. And the debate over the amendment shows a good deal of awareness of the needs of immigrants, as well as citizens, for \u201cthe equal protection of the laws.\u201d The Evenwel \u201crule,\u201d in other words, has been patched together more or less out of thin air, supplemented by a highly partial reading of a few Warren Court cases. Its result would be a political system even less tethered to the concerns of ordinary people than the present one. That prospect undoubtedly appeals to some Americans at this moment of demographic panic\u2014of a nostalgia for an alternate universe past when America was \u201cgreater,\u201d whatever that means. But it makes little sense within the genuine political universe created by the Constitution we actually have. It makes no sense as law.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A case being argued before the U.S. Supreme Court would limit representation to eligible voters\u2014favoring wealthier, whiter, and more conservative citizens.", "author": "Garrett Epps", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "A rule being argued before the U.S. Supreme Court would limit representation to eligible voters\u2014favoring wealthier, whiter, and more conservative citizens.", "title": "Who Gets to Be Represented in Congress?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/12/AP_527253662058/facebook.jpg?1449079288", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/12/evenwel-supreme-court-districting/418437/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Each district, in other words, should have roughly the same number of eligible voters, not the same number of people.\nThe plaintiffs in Evenwel v.
