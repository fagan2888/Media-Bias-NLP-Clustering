Volkswagen (VW) paid out 4.80 euros per common share and 4.86 euros per preference share on 2014 results.\n\nVW declined to comment.\n\nThe company is struggling to put a cost on the biggest business scandal in its history seven months after it admitted to cheating U.S. diesel emissions tests, as it is embroiled in legal proceedings around the world.\n\nArndt Ellinghorst, an analyst at market research firm Evercore ISI, expects VW's total costs from the \"dieselgate\" scandal to reach about 30 billion euros.\n\nFinal provisions will depend on the outcome of talks with U.S. regulators, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, one of the sources said.\n\nAnalysts have said a deal with U.S. authorities, also on financial penalties, would remove a major deterrent to investing in VW, whose shares have lost billions in value since the scandal broke in September.\n\n\"It would be a major positive trigger for the stock if VW quantified the total potential cost of the diesel affair,\" said Evercore ISI's Ellinghorst, who recommends buying VW shares.\n\nScandal-related expenses could cut VW's fourth-quarter operating profit 70 percent to 992 million euros, a Reuters poll of analysts found.\n\n(Additional reporting by Jan Schwartz and Emma Thomasson; Editing by Georgina Prodhan and Mark Potter)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen has reached a deal with U.S.", "title": "VW to pay each U.S. customer $5,000 to settle dieselgate: Die Welt", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/20/VW-resists-move-trial-instead-EPA-settlement", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/autoshow-geneva_3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/20/VW-resists-move-trial-instead-EPA-settlement", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/autoshow-geneva_3.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen has reached a deal with U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen has reached a deal with U.S. authorities to settle the case over its cheating of diesel emissions tests that would involve it paying each affected customer $5,000, Germany's Die Welt newspaper reported on Wednesday.\nGerman lawyer Christopher Rother told Die Welt that plaintiffs in Europe would seek to emulate the U.S. deal for their customers too.\nVolkswagen (VW) paid out 4.80 euros per common share and 4.86 euros per preference share on 2014 results.\nHowever, the owners of affected cars should receive $5,000 each in compensation and VW will separately have to pay to fix their vehicles, the paper said.\nCiting unidentified sources close to the negotiations, Die Welt said the agreement would be presented on Thursday to Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco, avoiding a trial."}
