STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- The Rev. Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life in New Dorp, announced Friday the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear the pro-life organization's case against the Obamacare contraception mandate.

"This is a great day in our battle for religious freedom against the culture of death, which wants us to participate in the spread of abortion," said Fr. Pavone. "We will not do so, and we look forward to making our case at the Supreme Court."

In addition to the organization as a whole, individual plaintiffs in the Priests for Life case include: Fr. Frank Pavone, National Director of Priests for Life; Janet Morana, Executive Director of Priests for Life and Co-Founder of the Silent No More Awareness Campaign, and Dr. Alveda King, Director of African-American Outreach for Priests for Life and niece of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

Six other related cases that also oppose the Affordable Care Act's birth control mandate will also be heard jointly by the Supreme Court.

In March, supporters of Priests for Life rallied in Washington, D.C., calling for the Supreme Court to hear their oral arguments regarding the controversial mandate.

Fr. Pavone said the point of the rally was to say to the government, "Stop trying to decide what we are going to do in matters of conscience" about contraception.

"This is a moment of Biblical proportions," he added.

Two years ago, Pavone threatened civil disobedience while his organization appealed the dismissal of their former lawsuit against the Obama administration's contraception mandate.

"Injunction or not, we will absolutely not obey, cooperate with, or tolerate in any way this unjust mandate," Fr. Pavone said at the time. "As Scripture says, we will obey God rather than men."

Fr. Pavone gained notoriety for his signature battle cry during Priests for Life's early opposition to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services mandate: "Sue the hell out of the Obama Administration."
