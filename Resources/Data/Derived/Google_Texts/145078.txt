Do You Approve Or Disapprove of President Obama's Job Performance? Vote Now in Urgent Poll

The liberal media-watchdog group backed by billionaire George Soros says its "war" on Fox News is over, claiming it has neutralized the right-leaning network and no longer sees it as a threat."It's not just that it's over, but it was very successful," Media Matters Executive Vice President Angelo Carusone bragged late this week to The Huffington Post "To a large extent, we won," he said.This week Media Matters gave the Huffington Post a look at its internal strategic plan for the next three years.Fox, which became the single focus of the activist group founded by bestselling author and journalist David Brock, has made key changes in programming that makes it no longer a worry to the left and the Obama administration.Media Matters also argues that Fox is not as influential as it once was because of the Internet and social media.But while Fox News didn't offer comment about the Media Matters so-called truce, polls show the highly rated network remains on top when it comes to viewer trust. A recent poll showed Fox News to be the most-trusted source of information on Obamacare, with a 19 percent ranking that put the network ahead of President Barack Obama, other major news networks, and even members of respondents' families.Despite its overall ratings success, the network has made key programming changes in the wake of last year's Republican electoral loss as audience numbers dipped.Andsome of Fox's more controversial personalities, such as Glenn Beck, have left while the network's leading conservative, Sean Hannity, was demoted with a time slot change from his prime 9 p.m. perch to his current 10 p.m.Megyn Kelly has taken over Hannity's slot and seen ratings grow. But she prides herself on her middle-of-the-road political take, telling NBC's Jay Leno recently that she not a "conservative operative."“I’m a straight news anchor, I’m not one of the opinion hosts at Fox,” Kelly saidKelly joins nighttime anchors such as Shepard Smith and Greta Van Susteren who tack left with Bill O'Reilly positioning himself as an independent.Since the election, other key conservative contributors such as Bill Kristol, Newt Gingrich and Dick Morris did not have their contracts renewed.Some conservative commentators are not happy about Fox's new direction.In September, popular syndicated radio host Mark Levin took aim at the network saying it had become establishment "Republican media" whose hosts have been "preaching accommodation, and surrender and moderation as conservatism.”Since President Obama took office, Fox had been under unrelenting attacks from the White House. At one point the Obama administration considered banning Fox from the White House press corps.Other press reports have indicated that the parent company of Fox, News Corp., has sought to cool the network's political temperature as it faces an ongoing Justice Department probe that it violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when its U.K. subsidiaries bribed police officials to get stories for its tabloid newspapers. The FCPA law prohibits U.S. companies from bribing foreign officials for purposes of influence and commerce.
