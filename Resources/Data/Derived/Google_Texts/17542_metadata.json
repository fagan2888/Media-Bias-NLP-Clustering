(Photo courtesy of Wikimedia.org)\n\nPROVIDENCE, R.I. \u2013 Voices are emerging to counter the din raised on college campuses by self-styled social-justice advocates as students who don\u2019t accept the need for \u201csafe spaces\u201d defend free speech against activists who would muzzle peers to weed out \u201cmicroaggressions.\u201d\n\nAt Princeton University, where activists have staged campus demonstrations and sit-ins to force administrators to remove former President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s name from schools, buildings and grounds, a group calling itself the Princeton Open Campus Coalition recently coalesced to counter the activists, according to a report in National Review, a conservative magazine.\n\n\u201cWe stand for academic freedom and open dialogue,\u201d the group stated in a letter penned to Princeton University President Christopher L. Eisgruber. Eisgruber recently agreed to study the issue of Wilson\u2019s legacy, assuaging demands made by members of activists calling themselves the Black Justice League.\n\nThe spirit of bucking campus activists has emerged at another Ivy League institution, Brown University.\n\nThe only catch for students looking to speak freely at the school is that they have had to go \u201cunderground\u201d to avoid a backlash. National Review published a close look at the situation on the Providence, Rhode Island, campus, where one student created an invite-only, private Facebook page to serve as a place where ideas could be freely discussed and opinions freely debated.\n\nThe irony, according to some, is rich.\n\nMeeting in secret so as to speak freely. Warsaw 1983? No \u2013 Brown University 2015. Via @jaynordlinger https://t.co/5vJD4iUBac \u2014 David Frum (@davidfrum) Nov. 23\n\nSophomore Chris Robotham, a student from Scituate, a Boston suburb, created the Facebook page a little more than a year ago. Little did Robotham know that soon, daily protests and demonstrations would engulf his campus, largely in response to a pair of racially charged columns published in the Brown Daily Herald, a student newspaper.\n\nThe columnist, who wrote under a pseudonym, offered in one piece, \u201cColumbian Exchange Day,\u201d that American Indians benefited somewhat under colonialism. The column has since been removed from the paper\u2019s website, replaced with an apology. Another column, exploring whether biology plays a role in racial inequality, stoked additional turmoil.\n\nEthnic studies faculty members issued a statement condemning the columns and denounced, among other things, the opinion that while the views expressed by columnists may be hurtful, they still represent the exercise of free speech rights.\n\n\u201cWhen these students read a racist rant in the Brown Daily Herald, they had the courage to say \u2018enough,\u2019\u201d read the statement, signed by nearly 50 professors. \u201cSadly, some inside and outside of Brown were then shocked that they dared to speak at all, and rode swiftly to the defense of supposedly embattled free speech and imperiled academic freedom.\u201d\n\n\u201cCalling out racism, we submit, is not an impingement on \u2018freedom of speech\u2019 or \u2018academic freedom,\u2019 it is an act of self-defense. And frankly, it is a relatively tiny one, lost in the sea of small slights, casual dismissals, and serious incidents that our students confront each day,\u201d the professors said.\n\nA Providence radio station managed to track down the columnist, Emma Maier, a junior. Maier disagreed with the newspaper\u2019s editors\u2019 decision to remove one of her columns and apologize for one and correct the other, according to the station\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cI absolutely do not agree with the decision to remove and/or apologize for the articles, for they were not racist or eugenicist in any way,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only violation they executed was to be a dissenting opinion away from Brown\u2019s radical and politically left-wing student groups.\n\n\u201cThese groups are admirably steadfast and good of heart, but sometimes the evil against which they stand is a vacuous evil, if that.\u201d\n\nThe backlash against Maier saw campus minority groups respond with letters to the newspaper, charging students of color are rarely included in coverage. Student and op-ed page contributor Sarah Jackson, a senior, wrote that the letters express \u201ca sense of isolation many students of color feel from the major newspaper on campus.\u201d\n\nJackson added that \u201cfreedom of speech doesn\u2019t guarantee a platform for every view.\u201d\n\n\u201cInitial feelings of hurt for many minority students after the publication of the two op-eds have been compounded by the framing of the fallout as an issue of free speech,\u201d Jackson noted.\n\nRobotham, stepping out of his Facebook free speech sanctuary, was the first reader to comment.\n\n\u201cThe Brown Daily Herald, like many prominent institutions at Brown have done before it, acted rashly in trying to quell criticism from those who were calling it racist, and in so doing, actually created a serious threat to freedom of political expression on Brown\u2019s campus,\u201d the sophomore wrote, referring to Maier\u2019s columns. \u201cThe threats to her free speech did not exist until the pieces were pulled and the BDH released that apology,\u201d he wrote. The moves, he added, \u201cset the precedent that something was unworthy of being said merely by its capacity to offend.\u201d\n\nRobotham pointed out that the Brown Daily Herald declined to delete a different op-ed that others saw offensive, an anti-military piece titled \u201cROTC: Return of the Criminals,\u201d which condemned what the columnist described as \u201cglorified state-sponsored killing.\u201d\n\nRobotham didn\u2019t respond to an email requesting comment on his Facebook creation.\n\n\u201cThe reason that people were up in arms about \u201cfree speech\u201d was that the BDH decided that it should pull certain pieces or prevent future ones from being published simply because it offended certain people, but refuses to do the same when it offends others,\u201d Robotham said in the note about Jackson\u2019s op-ed page article. \u201cTo do that is a very precedent-setting move by the most powerful institution of its kind on campus that does legitimately threaten the rights of certain people to express themselves.\n\n\u201cYour narrative that the controversy over free speech emerged merely as a result of the criticism of the content of her op-eds is entirely incorrect and creates the false impression that \u2018free speech\u2019 advocates were merely disguised defenders of her and her views looking to lessen others\u2019 criticisms. That was never the case.\u201d\n\nContact Evan Lips at [email protected] or on Twitter at @evanmlips.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2015/11/30/campus-activists-stir-defenders-of-free-speech/", "article_author_name": "Evan Lips", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Brown_University_Sayles_Hall-e1453995778499.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "Brown University, campus activists, campus newspapers, demonstrations, freedom of speech, New Jersey, Princeton University, protests, Providence, racial issues, Rhode Island"}, "description": "Voices are emerging to counter the din raised on college campuses by self-styled social-justice advocates as students who don\u2019t accept the need for \u201csafe", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Brown_University_Sayles_Hall-e1453995778499.jpg"}, "keywords": "boston,free speech,activists,campuses,brown university,campus activists,campus newspapers,demonstrations,freedom of speech,new jersey,princeton university,protests,providence,racial issues,rhode island", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Campus activists stir defenders of free speechPrinted from: http://newbostonpost.com/2015/11/30/campus-activists-stir-defenders-of-free-speech/Warmer weather attracts students to the lawns outside Sayles Hall at Brown University in Providence, where a debate has raged over free speech.\n\u201cYour narrative that the controversy over free speech emerged merely as a result of the criticism of the content of her op-eds is entirely incorrect and creates the false impression that \u2018free speech\u2019 advocates were merely disguised defenders of her and her views looking to lessen others\u2019 criticisms.\nRobotham, stepping out of his Facebook free speech sanctuary, was the first reader to comment.\nThe spirit of bucking campus activists has emerged at another Ivy League institution, Brown University.\n\u201cThe threats to her free speech did not exist until the pieces were pulled and the BDH released that apology,\u201d he wrote."}
