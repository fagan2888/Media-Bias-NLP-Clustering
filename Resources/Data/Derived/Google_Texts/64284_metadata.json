Mukasey was U.S. attorney general in the George W. Bush administration. Steven G. Bradbury was head of the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel during the George W. Bush administration and led the legal effort to obtain initial court approval for the NSA\u2019s metadata collection. David B. Rivkin Jr. served in the Justice Department and the White House Counsel\u2019s office during the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations.\n\nA federal judge\u2019s ruling Monday that the National Security Agency\u2019s (NSA\u2019s) bulk telephone metadata collection is \u201clikely\u201d unconstitutional is wrong on the law and the facts. It conflicts with the opinions of 15 other federal judges who have sat on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and approved the NSA\u2019s metadata collection 35 times since 2006.\n\nU.S. District Judge Richard Leon has stayed his order to give the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit the opportunity to reach its own judgment. But in the post-Snowden, anti-NSA climate pervading Washington, there is reason for concern that this opinion will amplify the caterwaul of those seeking to dismantle vital U.S. counterterrorism capabilities.\n\nThe telephone metadata collected by the NSA consists of transactional business records revealing only which phone numbers have called which numbers, when and for how long. It includes no other subscriber information, and it doesn\u2019t enable the government to listen to anyone\u2019s calls. This database enables intelligence agencies to discover quickly whether any phone numbers of known foreign terrorists have been in contact with numbers in the United States, a vital input in counterterrorism investigations. It is informative even when it reveals a lack of contacts.\n\nIn Leon\u2019s view, however, the Fourth Amendment prohibits Congress from authorizing the bulk metadata collection and the focused querying of those records, even where the president has determined its necessity and it is approved every 90 days by a federal judge. No case law remotely supports this breathtaking conclusion. Liberal use of exclamation marks is no substitute.\n\n1 of 20 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Top opinions stories of 2013 View Photos From Trayvon Martin to Obamacare: Take a look at a selection of the stories that caught readers\u2019 interests over the past year.

Maryland upholding the warrantless use of pen registers \u2014 devices that record numbers dialed \u2014 has become obsolete in this age of multifunction smartphones. But district judges are not empowered to declare the death of binding Supreme Court precedent. The calling-record data collected by the NSA is almost exactly the same data the police collected in Smith: the phone numbers that Michael Lee Smith called and the dates and times of those calls.\n\nIn Smith, the high court held that telephone customers have no reasonable expectation of privacy in the numbers they dial or in the calling records that phone companies generate for business purposes. And since the court\u2019s 1967 decision in Katz v. United States , a reasonable expectation of privacy has been the measure for what constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment. Appeals courts have consistently followed Smith and applied its holding to other developing technologies, including the collection of e-mail metadata.\n\nAlthough Monday\u2019s ruling emphasizes the \u201call-encompassing\u201d and \u201cindiscriminate\u201d nature of the NSA\u2019s metadata collection, that does not alter anyone\u2019s reasonable expectations of privacy. If anything, the use of a pen register to target Smith\u2019s personal phone line was more intrusive than the NSA\u2019s metadata collection, given the vastness and anonymity of the data set and the minuscule chance that any particular person\u2019s calling records will be reviewed by an NSA analyst.\n\nLeon cited the Supreme Court\u2019s 2012 decision in United States v. Jones , but that case is not germane. In Jones, the police trespassed on a suspect\u2019s property by installing a GPS device on his car and tracked his every move. The NSA\u2019s bulk collection entails no physical invasion of property and does not comprehensively track individual customers\u2019 movements and activities.\n\nEven if phone customers did reasonably expect that the numbers they dial would remain private, Leon\u2019s ruling makes another fundamental error when it misconstrues the \u201cspecial needs\u201d doctrine, which allows warrantless searches in special circumstances, based on a balancing of the government\u2019s need for the information against the extent of the infringement of privacy interests.\n\nLeon believes that the metadata program intrudes on consumers\u2019 infatuation with their smartphones, but having stressed the lifestyle changes brought by new technology, he fails to appreciate that individual privacy is much more porous today than it was in the 1970s. Many private companies collect and analyze personal data \u2014 including the Internet companies that want the NSA to stop its surveillance efforts. Most Americans willingly accept less privacy in exchange for the conveniences the Internet makes possible. But Leon\u2019s analysis means that U.S. intelligence agencies cannot protect Americans from foreign threats using the same analytical tools that private companies employ.\n\nAmericans know that many government agencies collect business records and information for lawful purposes and that this often includes personal data. What distinguishes the NSA is the importance of its national security mission and the extensive congressional and judicial oversight. Foreign governments, of course, collect all manner of data about Americans for their own military and commercial purposes.\n\nLeon was not convinced that metadata collection had produced the one critical piece of intelligence needed to stop a terrorist strike just before it was carried out, but that\u2019s an entirely unreasonable standard. Judging the value of an intelligence program demands the greatest deference to the political branches; courts are not institutionally suited to the task.
