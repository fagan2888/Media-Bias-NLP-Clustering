The deal, which is worth $2.78 billion, is expected to give Stryker a consistent revenue stream and a complementary portfolio of patient-care products.\n\nStryker\u2019s largest business is in surgical orthopedics, but more recently, the company has been building a portfolio of products focused on patient and caregiver safety, such as a system that keeps count of surgical sponges and specially designed \u2018smart\u2019 hospital beds. With the acquisition of Sage, Stryker gains a line of oral care products that fight hospital-associated pneumonia, specialty kits to prevent surgical site infections, and other patient hygiene solutions.\n\nRecent studies suggest that better enforcement of prevention practices can reduce HAIs by 70 percent, representing a cost-savings of between $25 billion and $31.5 billion, said the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (ODPHP). Starting in 2015, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have reduced payments by one percent to hospitals in the lowest performing 25 percent in HAI reduction, as mandated by the Affordable Care Act to incentivize better HAI prevention compliance.\n\nSage\u2019s reported sales reached $430 million last year, up 13 percent from the year before, reported the Wall Street Journal. Lobo remarked that the addition of Sage\u2019s products to Stryker\u2019s portfolio would provide \u201ca consistent disposable revenue stream.\u201d\n\nSage has been controlled by Madison Dearborn Partners, a private equity firm, since 2012, and once transferred to Stryker, the company will continue with its brand, leadership team, and location in Cary, Ill., said the Chicago Sun-Times.\n\n\u201cThe company\u2019s established leadership team and innovative products that help prevent hospital acquired conditions have driven consistent double-digit sales growth,\u201d said Stryker CEO, Kevin Lobo in a press release. \u201cThis acquisition aligns with Stryker\u2019s focus on offering products and services that support a mindset of prevention, specifically in the area of \u2018Never Events\u2019 such as hospital acquired infections.\u201d\n\nLast year, Stryker\u2019s board of director\u2019s authorized a $2 billion share repurchase program in addition to the $583 million of existing authorization to buy back some of Stryker\u2019s common stock, though Lobo commented in a press release that the program would not supersede Stryker\u2019s M&A ambitions.\n\nIn an earnings call, Lobo indicated that the acquisition of Sage was the first of several potential deals to be completed in the near future, reported Reuters. \u201cOne of the reasons to postpone the share repurchase program was to make sure we still have capacity, so this will not be the last deal that we do,\u201d said Lobo.\n\nStryker recently announced plans to build 3-D printing manufacturing facility in 2016 and that the company would be pursuing innovative new technology only possible with 3-D printing. According to Lobo, Stryker is in the lead in both 3-D printing and robotics.\n\nPending regulatory approval, the Sage deal is expected to close in the second quarter, and Stryker has added five cents per share to its adjusted earnings for 2016.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"description": "<p>Stryker has announced the acquisition of Sage Products, a manufacturer of disposable hospital supplies designed to prevent the spread of hospital-associated infections (HAIs).
