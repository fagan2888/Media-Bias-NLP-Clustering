It\u2019s easy to do. And it can take less than 20 minutes to set up. Yet more than half of all small businesses still don\u2019t have a website.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just ridiculous,\u201d says Jim Blasingame, a small business author and radio show host. \u201cEvery small business needs a website. Period. Nonnegotiable.\u201d\n\nSmall businesses that don\u2019t have one say they don\u2019t have the time, think it will cost too much or don\u2019t want the rush of orders that comes with being online. But entrepreneurs that have jumped to the digital side say their websites have boosted sales, cut down on time-consuming phone calls and brought more people into their stores.\n\nBut not everyone wants that.\n\nSteve Love has never had a website for the handmade sausage and meat business he\u2019s owned since 1988. He says a website for LoveLand Farms would boost sales and he doesn\u2019t have any more farmland to raise hogs and Black Angus cattle.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want it to grow,\u201d says Love, who sells his goods at a farmers\u2019 market in Bloomington, Indiana, and a store in another town that\u2019s open once a week. \u201cI\u2019m already maxed out. I\u2019m scared it would blow up on me.\u201d\n\nBut customers expect one. When they ask him at the farmers\u2019 market if he has a website, he hands them a card with his phone number and a map to his shop called the Sausage Shack in Nashville, Indiana. He has no plans to start a website anytime soon. But it could happen in the future if his kids want to take over and grow the business.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say never,\u201d says Love.\n\nSome owners simply say they have no time.\n\nBill Peatman, who writes blog posts, emails and other content for websites for his corporate clients, doesn\u2019t have one for his own business.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just been too busy,\u201d says Peatman, who started his Napa, California, business over a year ago. \u201cI haven\u2019t come up with a plan with what I want to do.\u201d\n\nHe knows he needs one. \u201cPeople don\u2019t think you exist,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to grow. I want to build my own reputation and brand.\u201d\n\nHe recently bought a domain name. And he plans to hire someone to build the site, but he thinks it will take him a few more months to get to it.\n\n\u201cAt the way I move,\u201d says Peatman, \u201cabout six months.\u201d\n\nFifty-five percent of small businesses don\u2019t have a website, according to a 2013 survey of more than 3,800 small businesses conducted by Internet search company Google and research company Ipsos. That\u2019s a slight improvement from the year before, when 58 percent said they didn\u2019t have a website.\n\nSmall business owners who want to start a website have lots of options that make it easier than in the past. Companies such as Wix.com, Google, SquareSpace.com and Weebly.com require no coding or technical skills. Users can choose a template, drag in photos and paste in words.\n\nAnd with more people searching for businesses online and on their smartphones, companies without a site may be missing out on extra business.\n\n\u201cYou might as well be a ghost,\u201d says Blasingame, who hosts \u201cThe Small Business Advocate,\u201d an online and nationally syndicated radio show. \u201cThe customers and opportunity pass right through you.\u201d\n\nSales at Bad Pickle Tees have doubled since Cyndi Grasman began selling her quirky food-related T-shirts online a year ago. She started the business in 2012, selling shirts with sayings like \u201cOh Kale Yeah!\u201d and \u201cI Heart Bacon\u201d at food festivals. She launched the site using website publishing company Weebly, paying $250 a year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m reaching a larger audience,\u201d she says.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 08 Jun 2014 21:08:16 -0400", "Description": "NEW YORK \u2014 It\u2019s cheap.
