Geoff Patton \u2014 MONTGOMERY MEDIA\n\nAbington >> Abington Health and Jefferson Health signed a letter of intent Wednesday, Oct. 29, to merge the two major health systems, which officials from both hailed at a press conference as a model in the future of health care.\n\nOver the last 30 days, leaders of the two have studied a model to join forces and the decision was made to move forward doing \u201cdue diligence\u201d over the next three months, with an anticipated closing in 2015.\n\nThe merger would include Abington Memorial and Lansdale and Jefferson\u2019s University, Neuroscience, Methodist, Navy Yard and Voorhees hospitals in addition to Jefferson\u2019s Sidney Kimmel Medical College, schools of Health Professions, Nursing, Pharmacy and Population Health and its graduate school.\n\nDr. Stephen Klasko, CEO and president of Thomas Jefferson University and Jefferson Health, will serve as president and CEO of the merged health system, with a combined 18,000 employees and revenue of about $3.2 billion, making it the second largest in the Philadelphia region after Penn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe role for Abington Health President and CEO Laurence Merlis was not specified.\n\n\u201cWe need to think through what is the most important management structure,\u201d Merlis said afterward. \u201cWe want it to be integrated.\u201d\n\nHealth care is \u201cbeing transformed from a value and sickness model to one based on value and wellness,\u201d Merlis said, terming the proposed merger \u201cproactive and bold.\u201d The \u201ccollective strength\u201d of the two organizations will allow them to focus on delivering \u201cthe right care at the right time and the right location at a most effective cost,\u201d he said.\n\nTerming Abington \u201can incredible partner with the right cultural fit,\u201d Klasko said, \u201cHealth care is really being stressed and plans need to be different.\u201d A \u201chub-to-hub\u201d model will provide \u201cincreased patient access at reduced cost,\u201d and \u201cwill draw others to the system.\u201d\n\nThe hub-to-hub model \u201crecognizes the strength of each system,\u201d and will allow it to \u201cdiversify in a way no other [system] can,\u201d he said.\n\nAbington Health is \u201cexcited and thrilled to be part of this transformative merger,\u201d board Chairman Steve Crane said, terming it a \u201cprecedent setter.\u201d A \u201cshared governance\u201d model \u2014 there will be trustees from both systems with some independent trustees \u2014 \u201cwill allow all trustees to focus on community goals with the ability to enhance health care, improve outcomes in a cost efficient manner.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a merging of two financially sound institutions \u2026 that share the same philosophy and culture of service,\u201d Jefferson Health Board of Trustees Chairman Rich Hevner said. The goal is to create \u201ca common culture toward a common mission \u2014 in this we have everything we need for success.\u201d\n\nThe actual signing of the letter was done before a roomful of staff members from both health systems, who applauded the move.\n\nUnlike Abington Health\u2019s plan to merge with Holy Redeemer in 2012, several doctors at the event Wednesday said the staff was on board this time.\n\nThe joint venture with HRH was scuttled after a backlash by some physicians and the public against Abington Memorial\u2019s plan to stop providing abortions. At the time, a number of AMH physicians were reportedly unhappy with the change in the abortion policy as well as the fact that they were not consulted prior to the tentative agreement being forged.\n\nThe staff is \u201cvery excited,\u201d AMH Chief of Staff Dr. Jack Kelly said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear\u201d in the current health care environment that \u201cthere is a benefit and need to consolidate the scope and scape \u2026 to drive value through population health.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis time we increased inclusiveness \u2026 kept the physicians informed throughout, sought their guidance,\u201d Kelly said.\n\n\u201cThere was a tremendous effort to set up committees,\u201d concurred Dr. Keith Sweigard, AMH chief of internal medicine and a member of the board of trustees. Department heads regularly contacted each other; \u201cthere are cultural fits, it seems right.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sense was one of inclusion,\u201d agreed Dr. Jonathan Sternlieb, AMH chief medical information officer.\n\nCombining the talents at both systems will create a \u201cwellness centered model,\u201d to \u201ccoordinate care across the span of a life and the breadth of an illness,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nAsked whether the merger would lead to layoffs, Kelly said, \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say whether we join with Jefferson or not, we have to look for economies. It\u2019s an opportunity to grow and provide new opportunities,\u201d he said, adding he did \u201cnot anticipate any change in the breadth of services we offer.\u201d\n\nThe only thing Jefferson currently offers that Abington does not is transplants, he said.\n\n\u201cWe know we will likely need to have some reorganization,\u201d Sweigard said. \u201cThere will be enough positions for talented individuals to be reassigned.\u201d\n\nAbington will remain a teaching hospital with its current affiliations with Temple and Drexel, and over time, perhaps \u201cincreased opportunities\u201d with Jefferson\u2019s medical school, Kelly said.\n\nIt will provide \u201ca more secure future to deliver our mission of patient care and education\u201d and \u201cset an example of how to bring partnerships together preserving the heritages of both,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe doctors will figure it out,\u201d Klasko said of management changes. \u201cThere will always be things unique to [each of] us.\u201d\n\nTo be successful under the Affordable Care Act, \u201cyou need the flexibility to think differently,\u201d Klasko said. \u201cWe wanted to create a new model.\u201d It will be a \u201ccombined cross-pillar organization,\u201d he said, naming the four pillars as: Jefferson\u2019s academic institutions, clinical, innovation \u2014 a \u201ctelehealth\u201d system and \u201cvirtual rounds\u201d \u2014 and philanthropy.\n\nThe hub-to-hub model is not a takeover, Klasko said. \u201cIt\u2019s not what\u2019s good for Jefferson or Abington, it\u2019s what good for patient care close to home at the lowest cost.\u201d\n\nJefferson has a national reputation and Abington is a strong brand locally, Merlis said, so to come up with a new name \u201cthere will be a master branding strategy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was the right decision at the right time for Abington, and Jefferson was our No. 1 choice and Jefferson felt the same way about Abington,\u201d Merlis said.\n\n\u201cThe horizon is 10 years out, plus we will continue to grow,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will see organizations \u2026 physicians that see this as different and want to be part of it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Health, Health news, Lansdale Health news, PA Health news, US Health news, world Health news.", "title": "Abington Health, Jefferson move toward merger", "og": {"url": "http://www.thereporteronline.com/article/RO/20141029/NEWS/141029776", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.thereporteronline.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/RO/20141029/NEWS/141029776/AR/0/AR-141029776.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1026px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Abington Health, Jefferson move toward merger"}, "twitter": {"domain": "thereporteronline.com", "description": "Abington >> Abington Health and Jefferson Health signed a letter of intent Wednesday, Oct. 29, to merge the two major health systems, which officials from both hailed at a press conference as a model in the future of health care.", "title": "Abington Health, Jefferson move toward merger", "url": "http://www.thereporteronline.com/article/RO/20141029/NEWS/141029776", "image": {"src": "http://www.thereporteronline.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/RO/20141029/NEWS/141029776/AR/0/AR-141029776.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@lansreporter", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id568473750", "iphone": "id525105540", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.reporter"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Health, Health news, Lansdale Health news, PA Health news, US Health news, world Health news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Abington >> Abington Health and Jefferson Health signed a letter of intent Wednesday, Oct. 29, to merge the two major health systems, which officials from both hailed at a press conference as a model in the future of health care."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcffce\"", "article_summary": "Executives from Abington Health and Jefferson Health celebrate at the official signing of a letter of intent announcing the planned merger of the two organizations Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2014.\nFrom left, Steve Crane, chairman, board of trustees, Abington; Larry Merlis, president and CEO, Abington; Steve Klasko, M.D., MBA, president and CEO, Jefferson University and Jefferson Health System; and Rich Hevner, chairman, board of trustees, Jefferson.\nGeoff Patton \u2014 MONTGOMERY MEDIAAbington >> Abington Health and Jefferson Health signed a letter of intent Wednesday, Oct. 29, to merge the two major health systems, which officials from both hailed at a press conference as a model in the future of health care.\nAdvertisementThe role for Abington Health President and CEO Laurence Merlis was not specified.\n1 choice and Jefferson felt the same way about Abington,\u201d Merlis said."}
