Boehner, the speaker of the House, and Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, agreed. As Congress prepares to leave for its August recess, accomplishments as well as maturity have been in short supply during the first 200 days of the 114th Congress.\n\nPartisanship is pervasive in Washington; much of the problems besetting Mr. Boehner and Mr. McConnell, however, result from deep divides within their party. The shortcomings include:\n\n\u2022 A stalemate on a long-term transportation/infrastructure measure that most agree is essential. While they approved a short-term fix to ensure that projects don\u2019t dry up, House and Senate Republicans publicly insulted the efforts of the other chamber; their private criticism is unrepeatable in polite company.\n\n\u2022 Senator Ted Cruz of Texas accused Mr. McConnell of telling a \u201cflat-out lie.\u201d The majority leader then denied Mr. Cruz an opportunity to offer an amendment on the floor.\n\n\u2022 Mark Meadows, a backbench House member from North Carolina, filed a motion last month asking Mr. Boehner to \u201cvacate\u201d his post. It was a silly, symbolic gesture, but the first such move in 105 years.\n\n\u2022 A reneging on promises to offer a comprehensive alternative to the Affordable Care Act and to overhaul immigration. The House and Senate staged futile votes to repeal Obamacare while offering no replacement; there was nothing on immigration.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLooming over lawmakers when they return in September are fights over government funding and raising the debt ceiling; the right wing is licking its chops at the prospect.\n\nThere have been successes: A government shutdown was avoided, trade promotion authority was passed \u2014 though if there is a Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal later this year, it could be sidetracked by an internal Republican fight over the United States Export-Import Bank. In addition, a bipartisan education bill that cleared the Senate must be reconciled with a partisan House measure.\n\nContrary to expectations that he would be a lame duck, President Obama has dominated Washington politics in the first half of the year, and the congressional Republican majority has often appeared reactive or reactionary.\n\nThere is considerable fear among leading Republicans about the funding fights. Conservatives, the rank and file in the House, and presidential contenders in the Senate are threatening a government shutdown unless Planned Parenthood is defunded; the concessions that will be demanded for raising the debt ceiling will be greater. Mr. Obama, empowered by having no more elections to win, has no intention of bowing to these conservative challenges.\n\nWashington was incensed by Mr. Cruz\u2019s language and Mr. Meadows\u2019s action. But Mr. Meadows\u2019s office says the outpouring of reaction to his anti-Boehner call was 99 percent favorable. And grass-roots Iowa conservatives praised Mr. Cruz for taking on a congressional leader.\n\nTop Republicans fear the rise of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy; his attacks on immigrants and trade only exacerbate the party\u2019s internal difficulties.\n\nAt private sessions in the Capitol, establishment Republicans, including some congressional leaders, realize that they cannot drive Mr. Trump from the race and that he might not crater soon. They are considering putting pressure on some of the second-tier candidates to bow out because the real estate mogul might be more vulnerable in a smaller field. That is most likely a quixotic mission and hope.\n\nThe poor performance of a congressional party has sometimes helped an eventual nominee: Ronald Reagan in 1980 and Barack Obama in 2008.\n\nIf Mr. Boehner and Mr. McConnell are able to avoid a disaster and pass a highway bill, along with the Pacific trade deal and a few measures next year, any adverse consequences for the party\u2019s standard-bearer could be neutralized. If not, the once bright prospects of a Republican Congress will be an albatross for the party.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150802113309, "twitter": {"description": "Accomplishments as well as maturity have been in short supply during the first 200 days of the 114th Congress.", "title": "Republican Problems Come From Within", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/03/us/politics/republican-problems-come-from-within.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003832682"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/03/us/politics/republican-problems-come-from-within.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003832682", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/03/us/politics/republican-problems-come-from-within.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "hdl_p": "Republican Problems Come From Within", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Aug. 2, 2015", "edt": "Global", "org": "Republican Party", "keywords": "House of Representatives,Senate,Republican Party,McConnell  Mitch,Boehner  John A,Cruz  Ted,Trump  Donald J,Obama  Barack,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Trans-Pacific Partnership,Immigration and Emigration,Presidential Election of 2016", "news_keywords": "Senate", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Albert R.
