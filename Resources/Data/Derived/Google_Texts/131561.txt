CULVER CITY, Calif. (AP) — Justin Bieber really wants you to like him again. After being the butt of the joke for hours during the taping of his Comedy Central roast, the 21-year-old singer gave a contrition speech.

“I turned a lot of people off over the past few years, but I know I can still turn out good music and turn everything all around,” said Bieber, whose music has been overshadowed by his offstage antics, which include reckless driving, public urination and throwing eggs at a neighbor’s home.

“I’ve lost some of my best qualities. For that, I am sorry,” he said. “I’m looking forward to being someone who you guys can all look at and be proud of.”

It was a sweet ending to a night of sharp barbs aimed as much at Bieber as the rest of the roasters. Hosted by Kevin Hart, the “Comedy Central Roast of Justin Bieber,” taped Saturday at Sony Studios, also features Snoop Dogg, Shaquille O’Neal, Martha Stewart and Ludacris. It’s set to premiere March 30.

“This is like suicide. Why would you do it?” Hart asked the singer, whom he described as a “huge success that confuses everybody over 14.”
