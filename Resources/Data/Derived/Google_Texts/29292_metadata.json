And anytime we can get some guys on base while he\u2019s coming up, something good usually happens.\u201d\n\nAs for whether Harper, still only 22, is the NL MVP?\n\n\u201cHis numbers say he is,\u201d Zimmermann said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see at the end of the season, but I\u2019m pulling for him.\u201d\n\nHarper leads the NL in homers, batting average (.340) and runs (113), and his three RBIs raised his total to 95, putting him 17 behind Colorado\u2019s Nolan Arenado.\n\n\u201cNot really worried about the MVP or anything like that. I\u2019ve said that numerous times. Just trying to win ballgames. And just trying to do everything I can to help this team win,\u201d Harper said. \u201cI definitely loved the support from the fans today.\u201d\n\nCoupled with the NL East-leading Mets\u2019 5-0 loss to the Yankees, Washington\u2019s win moved it seven games out with 14 to play, giving it still only the faintest of hopes of making the playoffs.\n\n\u201cJust worry about ourselves and worry about us winning games,\u201d Harper said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t win, it don\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nFour relievers followed Zimmermann, with Jonathan Papelbon working around two singles in the ninth to earn his 24th save.\n\nBrad Hand (4-7) gave up three runs and six walks in 4 2-3 innings. He is 0-8 in 12 appearances \u2014 10 starts \u2014 against the Nationals.\n\nRun-scoring hits by Christian Yelich and Justin Bour put Miami up 2-0 in the first. The score remained that way until the bottom of the fifth, when Hand fell apart.\n\nFirst, the lefty gave up Tyler Moore\u2019s homer with one out, on a drive just to the left of straightaway center. Then, after allowing a single to Zimmermann, Hand lost any semblance of control, walking two batters to load the bases for Harper, whose deep sinking liner made it 2-all.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the evolution. That\u2019s the evolution of his game. Grind at-bats. Bases loaded. The lefty-on-lefty matchup. Staying on balls. Doing what he can to put that ball in play,\u201d Nationals manager Matt Williams said. \u201cThose are the steps he\u2019s made this year and will continue to make that will allow him to do the things he wants to do on the field. Pretty good at-bat.\u201d\n\nTwo more walks by Hand, to Jayson Werth and Ian Desmond, forced in the go-ahead run, and Harper\u2019s homer off Kyle Barraclough padded the lead.\n\n\u201cThat was just a slider that ran right back into Harper\u2019s swing,\u201d Marlins manager Dan Jennings said. \u201cHe\u2019s having that MVP-type season for a reason.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nMarlins: 3B Martin Prado had a black brace on his left wrist and sat out a second consecutive game.\n\nNationals: 1B Ryan Zimmerman missed his 11th game in a row with a side muscle injury. Moore started at first base.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nIn Sunday\u2019s series finale, the Nationals send RHP Stephen Strasburg (9-7, 3.98 ERA) \u2014 coming off a 14-strikeout game \u2014 to the mound against Marlins LHP Justin Nicolino (3-3, 3.81).\n\nMILESTONES\n\nWerth has reached base in a career-best 28 consecutive games. \u2026 Nationals 3B Yunel Escobar\u2019s single in the first inning gave him 159 hits this season, a personal best.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Washington Nationals' Bryce Harper watches his two-run homer during the seventh inning of a baseball game against the Miami Marlins at Nationals Park, Saturday,", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "BlackPressUSA", "description": "[ASSOCIATED PRESS] WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 When Bryce Harper stepped to the plate in the first inning Saturday, a small group of Washington Nationals fans tried to get an \"M-V-P!\" chant going, with little success.
