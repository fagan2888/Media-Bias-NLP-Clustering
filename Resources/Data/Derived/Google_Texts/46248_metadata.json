It\u2019s not that Mikaela Shiffrin is immune to pressure. She just has found an effective weapon to combat it.\n\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019m in a little bit of denial about it,\u201d Shiffrin said Saturday after claiming her third slalom gold medal in three years, this one at the alpine world ski championships 4 miles from her family home and a month before her 20th birthday. \u201cI always say that I don\u2019t really feel pressure.\u201d\n\nShe did Saturday, with thousands of hometown fans hanging on her every turn, if not holding their breaths. She felt it, she tangled with it and she overcame it.\n\nAfter posting the fastest first run in the morning, Shiffrin slid into the starting gate almost five hours later with 67 gates and just over 48 seconds of skiing in front of her. All of the other medal hopes were in the finish, where the crowd was in full throat pulling for the hometown girl and waving American flags. That\u2019s when denial quit working.\n\nPHOTOS: Day 13 of 2015 FIS Alpine World Ski Championships\n\n\u201cI was so worried that I was going to screw it up,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cI was telling myself that I wasn\u2019t feeling pressure, that I\u2019m just going to go out and make my best turns and it\u2019s going to be fine. And no matter what happens it\u2019s OK, even if I don\u2019t get the gold, it\u2019s OK because life goes on.\n\n\u201cThen I\u2019m in the starting gate and I\u2019m like, \u2018God, I want this!\u2019 \u201c\n\nHer heart-stopping winning run didn\u2019t start out so well. At the first of two intermediate timings, she was behind the leader in the finish, Sweden\u2019s Frida Hansdotter. After the second split, Shiffrin was still behind.\n\nThen Shiffrin hit the accelerator. What would be shown by the clock was plain to the eye: Shiffrin was ripping the last 10 gates. She crossed the finish line 0.34 of a second ahead of Hansdotter, who had briefly allowed herself to think the gold medal might actually be hers.\n\n\u201cFor a couple of seconds, I was thinking, \u2018Oh, could it be?\u2019 \u201d Hansdotter said. \u201cBut then I saw her last part and she was skiing really good, so then I knew she would take it.\u201d\n\nShiffrin said she skied hard early in the run but took too conservative a line.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a mental battle with myself about how much to push to win it by as much as I can, versus how much to hold back so I don\u2019t screw it up,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cHopefully at some point in my career, I get to the point where I can charge every run top to bottom no matter what.\u201d\n\nShe was the favorite when she won her first world championships title two years ago in Schladming, Austria. She was the heavy favorite last year at the Sochi Olympics. Sochi was about making America proud. This one had a different edge. She didn\u2019t want to let down the home folks.\n\nAnd she heard it from them after the race. Why did you have to scare us like that?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very thankful,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cEverybody that I\u2019ve seen so far has said, \u2018Whoa, you almost killed us down here.\u2019 I guess that\u2019s the point, to have a good show, right? But it was not purposeful.\u201d\n\nIn Schladming, Shiffrin was third after the first run, 0.18 of a second behind Hansdotter. In Sochi, Shiffrin had the fastest first run and survived a scary bobble on the second. This time she led, trailed and ultimately prevailed.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t really rank it, honestly,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to rank these races, and sometimes I feel like ranking races \u2014 Sochi versus Schladming versus here \u2014 it puts me in the mind-set that some races are more important than others and some turns are more important. I don\u2019t really believe that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really special to win this medal in front of the home crowd, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s going to be close to my heart for the rest of my career. To have the opportunity during my career to go to world championships in my hometown, and to actually win a medal, and it\u2019s history, that\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d\n\nAnd, yes, there was pressure. There was no denying that anymore.\n\n\u201cIt does mean a lot and I\u2019m admitting that, now that the race is over and it came out in my favor,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cI get to admit how much I wanted this race.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer\n\nMikaela makes her mark\n\nMikaela Shiffrin, who turns 20 on March 13, has compiled a remarkable record since making her World Cup debut two days before her 16th birthday in 2011:\n\n2013: Gold medal in slalom, world championships, World Cup slalom title\n\n2014: Gold medal in slalom, Olympics, World Cup slalom title\n\n2015: Gold medal in slalom, world championships\n\nNote: Shiffrin also has 12 World Cup victories.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mikaela Shiffrin turns up speed late to win world title in slalom", "title": "Mikaela Shiffrin turns up speed late to win world title in slalom", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/14/mikaela-shiffrin-turns-up-speed-late-to-win-world-title-in-slalom/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150214__mikaela-shiffrin-ski-dp-021415p1.jpg", "height": 404}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150214__mikaela-shiffrin-ski-dp-021415p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-14T23:40:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T21:10:20+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "World Ski Championships 2015"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb903\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI get to admit how much I wanted this race.\u201dJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyerMikaela makes her markMikaela Shiffrin, who turns 20 on March 13, has compiled a remarkable record since making her World Cup debut two days before her 16th birthday in 2011:2013: Gold medal in slalom, world championships, World Cup slalom title2014: Gold medal in slalom, Olympics, World Cup slalom title2015: Gold medal in slalom, world championshipsNote: Shiffrin also has 12 World Cup victories.\nIn Sochi, Shiffrin had the fastest first run and survived a scary bobble on the second.\nShe crossed the finish line 0.34 of a second ahead of Hansdotter, who had briefly allowed herself to think the gold medal might actually be hers.\nPHOTOS: Day 13 of 2015 FIS Alpine World Ski Championships\u201cI was so worried that I was going to screw it up,\u201d Shiffrin said.\nBut it was not purposeful.\u201dIn Schladming, Shiffrin was third after the first run, 0.18 of a second behind Hansdotter."}
