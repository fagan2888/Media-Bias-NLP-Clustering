Governor, Jeff Colyer.\n\nThere is someone who has been a part of this ritual for a long time \u2013 and that is Associated Press reporter John Hanna, who is covering his 30th consecutive State of the State address.\n\nThat\u2019s a great milestone, John, exceeded only by Martin Hawver who is covering his 40th address.\n\nHere, we celebrate freedom.\n\nHere, we practice self-government.\n\nHere, the people rule.\n\nAnd here we crown no royalty\u2026except in baseball!\n\nWell, soccer too, and football and basketball hopefully.\n\nAnd as our region\u2019s latest champions showed us, with the right fundamentals and teamwork, we can accomplish anything in time.\n\nIt was precisely five years ago tonight when I first addressed this body on the State of our State.\n\nAnd just look at what has happened in those five years:\n\nMore than 388,000 low income Kansans now pay zero income taxes.\n\nKPERS is out of the bankruptcy zone. Our funded liability percentage is up by 13% since 2012.\n\nK-12 spending is at an all-time high. Up by more than $300 Million.\n\nMore than half the people who were on welfare are now off it, and more importantly, they are getting out of poverty.\n\nWe have embraced innovation and modernization in our Medicaid system, providing more services and better outcomes for 20,000 more Kansans than before.\n\nMore than 96,000 Kansas children have participated in innovative reading programs. Over 3,000 high school students have participated in the Jobs for America\u2019s Graduate Program and graduated at a rate of 93%.\n\nParticipation in technical education has tripled since we began the program.\n\nWe are graduating 2,100 more engineers from our state universities.\n\nWe have controlled spending, reformed tax policy, and reduced burdensome regulations.\n\nWe have consolidated agencies, eliminated wasteful programs, and overhauled workers compensation.\n\nWe lifted the Major League Soccer Cup Trophy with Sporting KC.\n\nAnd we have seen the Wichita State Shockers join basketball\u2019s \u201cbig dance\u201d every year since 2012.\n\nWorking together, we\u2019ve created an economic environment that has seen Kansas gain more than 78,000 private sector jobs and achieve its lowest unemployment rate in fourteen years.\n\nWorking together, we\u2019ve created an economic environment where hard-working Kansans have seen their wages increase more than 10%.\n\nKansans are finding good jobs, right here in our state.\n\nWorking together, we\u2019ve created an economic environment where new filings for businesses increased by 15%.\n\nWorking together last year, we created a stable regulatory environment that will see nine new wind farms come on line this year, at an investment of nearly $3 billion.\n\nKansas is once again a national leader in wind energy development.\n\nMr. Speaker, Madam President, it is for these reasons \u2013 and many more- that I can report to you that the State of our State is strong.\n\nKansas is strong. And Kansas is growing.\n\nIt\u2019s often said that Kansas feeds the world.\n\nAnd we will continue to provide for our fellow Americans and support the global economy\n\nBy providing food:\n\nWheat, beef, and now dairy.\n\nBy providing energy:\n\nOil and gas, ethanol, and renewable.\n\nBy providing air travel:\n\nFrom our manufacturers in Wichita and suppliers across South Central Kansas.\n\nBy providing recreation:\n\nThe National Water Trail, the Flint Hills Nature Trail, NASCAR and world class hunting and fishing.\n\nWildcat football.\n\nJayhawk Basketball.\n\nAnd finally, by providing a business climate where the Financial Services Industry can grow and prosper under the leadership of the industry executives and Insurance Commissioner Ken Selzer.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges we face in much of Kansas is the future of our water.\n\nOne of my passions as Governor is to prepare the state to be in a better position for the future. To do that we\u2019ve got to prepare today and in some cases we have to sacrifice some now so our kids and grandkids have better options.\n\nThe work we have accomplished to preserve and extend water resources in Kansas in the last three years has been significant.\n\nThe first Local Enhanced Management Area has been in operation for three years in 99 square miles of Northwest Kansas. They have reduced their water use by roughly 20 percent, and maintained their net income.27 That should extend the useful life of the Ogallala in that area by 25 years.28\n\nThat is solid progress but more needs to happen.\n\nWe are, right now, dredging John Redmond Reservoir, the first federal reservoir to be dredged in the nation.\n\nWhether it\u2019s dredging projects or reducing our demands on the Ogallala, it\u2019s going to take time and some sacrifice.\n\nWe are going to continue implementing action items in the Long Term Vision for Kansas Water.\n\nWith most natural resources, we aren\u2019t just taking them to use for today. We are borrowing them from the future.\n\nPerhaps no one individual has done more to protect our water than the recipient of the first Water Legacy Award.\n\nWayne Bossert was the long-time director of Groundwater Management District #4. Now retired, he led the organization at the time it formed the state\u2019s first LEMA in Thomas and Sheridan County, to help preserve the aquifer.\n\nWayne\u2013thank you for your vision to protect this vital resource for the future.\n\nSpeaking of the future. I\u2019d like to talk about our investment in our children.\n\nBy far the biggest item funded by state government is education. That is as it should be.\n\nBut education in the 21st century can no longer be based on 19th century models.\n\nParents and educators across the state have sought innovative options, from alternative teacher certification and merit pay to scholarships backed by tax credits.\n\nWe must have an educational system that has a range of options in which our students can learn and prosper and grow.\n\nEducation is not done by money or buildings. It is done by teachers.\n\nTeaching isn\u2019t a job or a vocation. It\u2019s a calling. I know. I have taught. Two of my children teach.\n\nFormer students are prized people to teachers. The bond of teacher and student never breaks.\n\nTeachers need money to care for their needs. That\u2019s why Kansans invest in education: so good teachers are able to do their calling and teach.\n\nYet today, of the more than $4 billion the state puts into education funding, not nearly enough goes toward instruction.\n\nThat\u2019s highly inefficient, if not immoral, denying Kansans from putting their education dollars were they want it\u2026behind a good teacher.\n\nI call on the legislature to design a new education funding system that puts more of our money into instruction. That provides bonuses for exceptional teachers and recognizes their true value to our future and the souls of our students.\n\nTo keep Kansas strong we must also keep it safe.\n\nIn December, the Kansas Highway Patrol graduated its 55th class of troopers. It was the largest class in recent years.\n\nI saw fathers pin badges on sons. I saw families stand proudly with their wife, husband, father, son or daughter as they received their badges. But I was most moved by the sight of twin brothers \u2013 one becoming a trooper and the other pinning on his badge.\n\nJonathan Blank became a KHP trooper that day, after serving as a U.S. Marine with two tours of duty in Iraq. He received his badge from his brother, Linden Blank also a U.S. Marine who served \u2013 and was gravely injured \u2013 in Afghanistan.\n\nPlease join me in recognizing these two outstanding young men from Augusta Kansas, who put the welfare of others before their own safety. Jonathan and Linden \u2013 thank you.\n\nElected officials have a responsibility to protect our citizens from all threats, foreign and domestic.\n\nIn this, the President has refused to lead.\n\nHe has prioritized his agenda and the feelings of the radical Islamic terrorists over the safety of Americans.\n\nHe is unwilling to take simple actions to improve our security. Therefore, we must act.\n\nIt is my responsibility, as Governor of this great state to do what we can to protect the citizens of Kansas.\n\nAnd we must act to maintain the security of our state.\n\nLast summer, in response to the attack on recruiting facilities in Tennessee, I ordered Adjutant General Tafanelli to complete a comprehensive security assessment of all Kansas National Guard facilities.\n\nIncluded in his report was a plan to arm and train additional personnel and make security enhancements to our National Guard facilities. My budget proposal includes funding to support these activities.\n\nI call on legislators from both sides of the aisle to strongly support this request and send a clear message to our troops that we stand with them.\n\nIn November, in response to the horrific terrorist attacks in Paris I directed all state agencies to immediately cease the placement of refugees from countries where potential terrorists can arise, due to our inability to verify their background. More than thirty other Governors across the nation joined in this call.\n\nGovernors, both Republican and Democrat, continue to question the federal government\u2019s ability to properly screen people claiming to be refugees. Governors must have the information they need to protect the people they serve.\n\nInstead of simply pausing his resettlement plan and working with the governors to address their legitimate security concerns, President Obama has chosen to pursue a path that puts Americans at risk.\n\nMr. President, this will not work.\n\nWe must \u2013 and will \u2013 act to protect the citizens of Kansas.\n\nLast year we also learned that President Obama has resurrected his plan to close the terrorist detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and transfer terrorists to the United States.\n\nHis own Secretary of Defense knows it is not a good idea.\n\nHis own Attorney General knows it would be illegal.\n\nThe President does not care.\n\nTherefore, we must be prepared to act. And we are.\n\nEvery member of the Kansas Congressional Delegation, the Lieutenant Governor, the Attorney General, and I each stand at the ready to thwart every action the President takes to transfer terrorists to Kansas.\n\nKansas was founded by people of strength. People who understood the value of hard work, of friendship, of faith.\n\nThe strength of Kansas lies in the hearts and minds of our people. Here the people rule. All of our people.\n\nJames Madison, writing in the Federalist Papers, warned of the dangers of placing too much power in the noble elites that could control our judicial process. This warning rings true today.\n\nKansas is the only state in the country where the selection of Supreme Court justices is controlled by a handful of lawyers.\n\nKansas, however, is grounded in the principal of representative democracy.\n\nThe current selection method used for the Supreme Court removes the people of Kansas from the process of selecting judges.\n\nIt places the process in the hands of those lawyers who regularly appear in front of the judges they select.\n\nWell, enough is enough.\n\nThe Legislature should put before Kansas voters a proposed Constitutional amendment for a more democratic selection process for our Supreme Court justices.\n\nWe must have faith in the people. Here the people rule.\n\nSince 1999, when the property tax lid was lifted, Kansans have seen those tax rates increased by 24 percent, and property tax revenue increase by 92%.\n\nUnderstandably, people do not like this.\n\nYour property taxes should not grow faster than your paycheck.\n\nThey carry heavy burdens on all Kansans, especially those living on fixed incomes.\n\nLast year, you acted to place a lid on property taxes. That was a positive step.\n\nThe ability to raise taxes at the local level should not be made without consent and input from local citizens.\n\nVoters should have the ability to make their voices heard with an up or down vote on any proposal that raises property taxes in excess of inflation.\n\nI would welcome legislation that strengthens the property tax lid by closing the existing loopholes and puts it in place sooner.\n\nHere, the people rule.53 Here, the people have a voice.\n\nKansans value self-sufficiency and independence.\n\nBut some Kansans are still struggling. And we have an obligation to help them.\n\nWe implemented common-sense requirements for those on welfare with the goal of providing economic opportunity instead of government dependency.\n\nWe said, if you have no disabilities and no children at home, you should work or train for work at least 20 hours per week.\n\nThe results are in. The reforms have worked.\n\nOur caseloads are 70% lower today than they were before we made the change.\n\nThe work participation rate among enrollees nearly tripled.\n\nThe amount of time able-bodied adults spend on food stamps has been cut in half.\n\nAnd those leaving welfare are better off!\n\nBefore work requirements, 93% of able-bodied adults on welfare were in poverty. Most were in severe poverty and not working at all.\n\nBut within a year of leaving welfare, their incomes had more than doubled \u2013 an increase of 127% on average.\n\nThe number of enrollees who have risen out of poverty tripled.\n\nThese are real people. These are our friends and families and neighbors. We\u2019ve seen what happens when they get off welfare and have hope of a better life.\n\nIn Franklin County, a man had been trapped on welfare since early 2009. He had been on food stamps for four and a half years, with no end in sight.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t working and had no earned income. But that all changed when the work requirement went into effect.\n\nHe began working. And after a year, he was earning $45,000 a year.\n\nWe have even seen the marriage rate go up as the numbers of men and women who are out of poverty and working has gone up.\n\nWe\u2019re moving people out of poverty, out of dependency, and into self-sufficiency. We\u2019re giving them the hope of a better life.\n\nOur work to help struggling Kansans must continue.\n\nThat includes supporting access to quality health care.\n\nWhen we took office in 2011, I asked Lt. Governor Dr. Jeff Colyer to modernize and transform the State\u2019s Medicaid program. Previous administrations had cut reimbursement rates and reduced services, yet costs were still out of control.\n\nToday, we have higher reimbursement rates for providers, more services for clients and, most importantly, we have better, measurable health outcomes for Kansans who participate in KanCare.\n\nWe have also saved nearly $1 Billion over the projected cost estimates for the old Medicaid program. We have proven that a Kansas solution is better than one from Washington, DC.\n\nKanCare is working. ObamaCare is failing.\n\nI grew up in a town with a population of 268. I do understand rural hospitals are often the lifeblood of their community.\n\nObamaCare has increased healthcare costs in Kansas and especially hurt rural healthcare.\n\nIt was ObamaCare that cut Medicare reimbursements to rural hospitals.\n\nIt was ObamaCare that caused the problem. We should not expand ObamaCare to solve the problem.\n\nTonight, I am asking Lt. Governor Colyer to assemble a working group to address the problems of health care delivery in rural Kansas and to present a proposal to me by this time next year.\n\nAs a fifth generation rural Kansan and a physician, I can think of no one better suited to take on this vital task than Dr. Colyer.\n\nI believe this working group should have frontline stakeholders involved, including a rural hospital administrator and a rural physician at the same table as top policy makers.\n\nWe will welcome input from diverse organizations, but let\u2019s be realistic. Congress recently voted to defund expansion. We cannot rely on yet another ObamaCare false promise.\n\nWe can and should find a Kansas solution that will improve rural healthcare access and outcomes.\n\nEnsuring the health and safety of Kansans means protecting all Kansans at every stage of life.\n\nWe must keep working to protect our most innocent Kansans, the unborn. We have become the shining city on the hill and the champions for life.\n\nAs Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote: \u201cEvery nation that carries in its bosom great and unredressed injustice has in it the elements of this last convulsion.\u201d\n\nKansas was founded on the principal that every life has dignity, that every life has beauty, that every life has value.\n\nEvery year since I became Governor we have enacted pro-life legislation.\n\nWe have come a long way, but there is still work to be done.\n\nIn 2011, I signed legislation stopping most taxpayer funding from going to Planned Parenthood. The time has come to finish the job.\n\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s trafficking of baby body parts is antithetical to our belief in human dignity.\n\nToday, I am directing Secretary Susan Mosier to ensure that not a single dollar of taxpayer money goes to Planned Parenthood through our Medicaid program. I welcome legislation that would enshrine this directive in state law.\n\nAs we begin this year\u2019s legislative session, I leave you with this timeless question:\n\nThe Ancients asked of God, \u201cWho is man that you are mindful of him?\u201d They saw an Earth so big and awe inspiring. A sky so vast. Stars without number. They felt small and insignificant.\n\nModern man suffers no such humility.\n\nWe deem ourselves masters of our own destiny. The Earth our ship to guide and life a voyage where we choose the destinations.\n\nSo who is right?\n\nWe conquer one problem but new ones arise in increasing number. We are perplexed when things don\u2019t go as we think they should.\n\nMaybe our forefathers were closer to right than we thought. What if God is bigger than we can think and we actually are smaller than we can believe?\n\nWouldn\u2019t that give us the proper awe of a sunset and thankfulness for our lives and blessings?\n\nWith that in mind, I invite each of us to be thankful and enjoy the chance to serve our fellow citizens in such a wonderful role. To also think more highly of others than we do of ourselves \u2014 even if they are of a different political persuasion.\n\nI\u2019ll seek to do this. I also invite each of us to contemplate and consider the reasons we are here. In this job. At this time. In this place.\n\nQuestions to which our ancestors would quickly and humbly reply, \u201cTo love God and one another.\u201d God bless you all.
