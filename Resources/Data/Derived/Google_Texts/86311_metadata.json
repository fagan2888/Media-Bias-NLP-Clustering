The board will recommend he receive $408,000 for economic losses.\n\nSuthers said the board will also recommend that if other victims agree, legislators award $600,000 now being held for victims to those who lost family.\n\nSuthers told victims of the fire that if they agree to accept the amount the claims board recommends to legislators, they would have to waive any additional claims against the state, said Thomas Henderson, a lawyer for a handful of the 21 claimants.\n\nSuthers said according to statute, the claims board is prohibited from recommending payment of non-economic damages to the legislature.\n\nThe board wants to get the recommendations to the General Assembly during the budget-making process now underway, Suthers said. Victims can wait to decide if they are willing to take what is offered, but if they do the legislature may not take the matter up until next year, Suthers said.\n\nThe victims can challenge the board\u2019s recommendations in court, but had not decided whether they would do that on Tuesday.\n\nThe claims board will meet again on Wednesday to decide on claims of five other victims.\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Claims board will recommend damages for North Fork fire victims", "title": "Claims board will recommend damages for North Fork fire victims", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/04/08/claims-board-will-recommend-damages-for-north-fork-fire-victims/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20120327__aerial-lnffp1.jpg", "height": 399}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20120327__aerial-lnffp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-08T13:46:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T14:23:50+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc6cd\"", "article_summary": "The claims board will meet again on Wednesday to decide on claims of five other victims.\nThe state would pay 21 victims of the deadly 2012 Lower North Fork fire $11.4 million if the legislature accepts a recommendation of the Colorado State Claims Board.\nSuthers said according to statute, the claims board is prohibited from recommending payment of non-economic damages to the legislature.\nSuthers said the board will also recommend that if other victims agree, legislators award $600,000 now being held for victims to those who lost family.\nThe victims can challenge the board\u2019s recommendations in court, but had not decided whether they would do that on Tuesday."}
