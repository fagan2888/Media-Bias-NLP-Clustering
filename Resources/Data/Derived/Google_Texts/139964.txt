UPDATED | An aide to Republican senate candidate Steve Lonegan said he regretted a racy, expletive-laden interview he gave to political blog Talking Points Memo Friday.

“I shouldn’t be talking anymore,” Rick Shaftan, a chief aide to Mr. Lonegan, said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal Friday evening.

“I shouldn’t mouth off like that. It’s not representative of Lonegan, it’s representative of Rick Shaftan,” he said about his remarks.

Mr. Lonegan, the former mayor of Bogota, N.J. and a conservative, is running against Democrat Cory Booker in a race for New Jersey’s open U.S. Senate seat Wednesday. The battle has become especially heated in recent days.

In the article posted Friday, Mr. Shaftan referenced tweets exchanged between Mr. Booker and an Oregon exotic dancer, Lynsie Lee. Mr. Shaftan alleged that Mr. Booker could be gay because his tweets supposedly didn’t reflect what a straight man would say to a stripper.

“It’s just like like there was no sexual interest at all. I don’t know,” Mr. Shaftan said.

Mr. Shaftan didn’t say whether he realized if the interview was on or off the record, but said it was “not the right thing to say.”

“If it hurts Steve, I regret it,” he said. “It’s representative of my crude self, not Steve. It’s how I talk, good or bad.”

On Friday evening, Mr. Lonegan campaign released a statement saying Mr. Shaftan had been fired.

“Mr. Shaftan’s comments are not reflective of my views or that of my campaign,” the candidate said. “His comments are distasteful and offensive, and his contract as a vendor for my campaign will be terminated immediately.”

Corrections & Amplifications: An earlier version of this story said that Mr. Lonegan was making an implication about Mr. Booker’s sexual orientation. It has been revised to say that Mr. Shaftan was making the implication.
