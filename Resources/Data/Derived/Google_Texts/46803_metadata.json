Steve Rossi \u2026\n\nOriginally built in 1918, the Elizabethan-style brick house on Round Hill Road will be listed with Jane Howard Basham of David Ogilvy & Associates, an affiliate of Christie's International Real Estate. The current owners spent about three years renovating the house, which has a new staircase, new kitchen with a La Cornue stove and butler's pantry and new mechanical systems. Steve Rossi \u2026\n\n\u2026 The gated property was last sold by the Helmsley estate to an undisclosed buyer in 2010 for $35 million, Ms. Basham said. At the time, it was among the priciest deals ever in the affluent town, although it sold for far less than its initial $125 million price tag. Mrs. Helmsley, who died in 2007, was married to real-estate mogul Harry Helmsley. ( See related article ) Steve Rossi\n\nThe Wooldon Manor estate in New York's Southampton, which Scott A.

Chris Foster \u2026\n\nIn a transaction that closed July 15, a buyer purchased about half the property\u2014the roughly 10,000-square-foot oceanfront home and an adjoining 2-acre parcel\u2014for $50 million, said Mr. Davis. Another buyer\u2014a developer\u2014is in contract to purchase the remainder of the property, which consists of three building lots, with plans to construct homes there.

The 3.725-acre island, in the Thames near London, could be the spot where King John met with his rebellious barons to place his seal on the historic document, according to Nicholas Vincent, professor of Medieval History at the University of East Anglia. Sotheby's Realty UK \u2026\n\nIn 1967, the family of owner Graham Cooper bought the island, which now contains a seven-bedroom, two-bathroom private home. The house has a Magna Carta memorial room, shown, containing a stone upon which King John is said to have sealed the document. The room, with stained glass windows, has walls hung with the crests of King John and 25 barons. Sotheby's Realty UK \u2026\n\n\u2026 When Mr. Cooper's father, a banker who worked in London, bought the house, it hadn't been lived in for some time and 'was in a very sorry state,' he said. The family restored and renovated the house, putting on a new roof and installing an outdoor swimming pool. There are expansive lawns with flower beds and an apple orchard. A small bridge connects the island to the mainland.
