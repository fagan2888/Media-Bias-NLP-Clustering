Verizon received two: One in industry best practices and another in disclosure of content removal by the government. AT&T does not host content, so that category did not apply to it.\n\nWhatsApp, the instant messaging app owned by Facebook, received only one star for its parent company\u2019s stated position against government backdoors.\n\n\u201cThis is WhatsApp\u2019s first year in the report, and although EFF gave the company a full year to prepare for its inclusion in the report, it has adopted none of the best practices we\u2019ve identified as part of this report,\u201d according to the report.\n\nA total of nine companies received a star in every category, including Yahoo, Apple, Dropbox, Wordpress, Wikimedia, Wickr, Sonic and Credo.\n\nFacebook fell just shy of receiving all five stars, because the EFF said it does not disclose the number of U.S. government requests to remove user content, like it does for other countries.\n\nGoogle, Amazon, Microsoft and Comcast received three stars. Twitter received four.\n\nThe EFF noted its scoring system has become increasingly robust as the industry adopts best practices. Nearly every tech company, for instance, now publishes a transparency report.\n\n\u201cUsers should look to companies like Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon to be transparent about the types of content that is blocked or censored in response to government requests, as well as what deleted data is kept around in case government agents seek it in the future,\u201d according to the report.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Electronic Frontier Foundation rated 24 tech and telecom companies.", "description": "The Electronic Frontier Foundation rated 24 tech and telecom companies.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Mario Trujillo", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The Electronic Frontier Foundation rated 24 tech and telecom companies.", "title": "Verizon, AT&T, WhatsApp rank low in data privacy report", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/245516-verizon-att-whatsapp-rank-low-in-data-protection-report", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/verizon03062015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/245516-verizon-att-whatsapp-rank-low-in-data-protection-report", "dcterms.date": "2015-06-19T10:12-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Mario Trujillo", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "data policies,,Electronic Frontier Foundation, Verizon, AT&T, WhatsApp", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-19T10:12:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/245516-verizon-att-whatsapp-rank-low-in-data-protection-report", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The Electronic Frontier Foundation rated 24 tech and telecom companies.", "card": "summary", "title": "Verizon, AT&T, WhatsApp rank low in data privacy report"}, "dcterms.title": "Verizon, AT&T, WhatsApp rank low in data privacy report"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddcb2\"", "article_summary": "Verizon received two: One in industry best practices and another in disclosure of content removal by the government.\nAT&T received only a single star in the industry best practices category.\nAT&T, Verizon and WhatsApp have some of the worst policies when it comes to protecting users\u2019 data from the government, according to a new report by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).\nThe EFF noted its scoring system has become increasingly robust as the industry adopts best practices.\nThe tech privacy group ranked 24 technology and telecommunications companies on a list of transparency and privacy categories in its new \u201cWho has your back?\u201d report released this week."}
