Republicans hope that assertion will hold up as well as \u201cIf you like your insurance plan you can keep it.\u201d\n\nHouse Budget Committee Chairman Rep. Paul Ryan with fellow Republican committee members. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)\n\nThe president says it \u2014 whatever the \u201cit\u201d is (grandfather your existing plan?) \u2014 is here. Forever. And yet, Democrats aren\u2019t running on their permanent addition to the government. Far from it. Democrats running in red states keep promising to \u201cfix\u201d Obamacare. (Does anyone think a Democratic White House would let them? Democratic Party chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.) says there is nothing much to fix, just small stuff.) The office of the maybe soon-to-be Republican Senate majority leader ruefully sent out an e-mail with the subject \u201cWell, if SHE doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea\u2026\u201d; attached was a report that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was already moving on. (\u201cWhile Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi took an Obamacare victory lap Tuesday afternoon, she appeared hesitant to make the law the central plank in her party\u2019s push to win in 2014, telling reporters that \u2018while we\u2019re proud of the Affordable Care Act, we now pivot to jobs.\u2019 \u201d)\n\nNothing is ever beyond debate in American politics, as we all know. Surely the Democrats in 2016 will change their tune and claim the election of a Democratic president is essential to keeping Obamacare. But Obamacare now has generated two measuring sticks: the original promise of no insurance plan upheaval, no cost hikes and tens of millions newly insured, and the reality of Obamacare. The Republicans no longer are obliged to meet the former; but it is more essential than ever that they tell voters they can have something better, cheaper and less disruptive than Obamacare in practice. It is one thing to tell voters that Obamacare is rotten and should be replaced by a better GOP plan; it\u2019s quite another simply to pull the plug and invite Democrats to claim Republicans are \u201ctaking away\u201d health-care coverage.\n\nIt will behoove the House to pass its alternative. It will be necessary for every 2016 contender for president to lay out his or her own ideas. If Republican reformers are serious, they will present a whole slew of GOP proposals to make life better for middle-class and poor voters, starting with a better health-care system, school choice, a pro-growth economic plan and a domestic energy initiative.\n\nThe president has it exactly wrong.
