South Dakota Game, Fish, and Parks is going digital with their small game, fish, and trapping licenses.

Hunters and fishers can now log into the GF&P online licensing system and find a barcode that conservation officers can scan right from your smartphone. Just long into your account, take a screenshot of the electronic version of your license, and show that screenshot to a conservation officer.

This new electronic method is not applicable for waterfowl stamps, tags, and licenses mailed from the GF&P licensing office.

Hard copies of your licenses are still accepted.
