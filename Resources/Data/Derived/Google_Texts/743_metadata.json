Even for fans of this show, this may prove to be a very productive development. Despite having as many classic laugh lines as ever, \u201cVeep\u201d may have exhausted the comedic possibilities of its self-defined universe and needs to refresh its tropes. Fortunately, the new showrunner has the perfect example of how the show should develop in HBO\u2019s comedy that preceded \u201cVeep\u201d on the Sunday-night schedule\u2014Mike Judge\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley.\u201d\n\nFrom \u201cVeep\u2019s\u201d outset, policy substance has existed only in the background, if at all. It is never used as a motivation for the characters or a direct plotline. Part of that has been an effort to create a self-contained universe that is not supposed to be \u201cbased on\u201d anything real. (This has had some salutary effects, such as how the only real guest-stars on the show were some members of the Baltimore Orioles in season one\u2014a welcome contrast to the cameos by real politicians and journalists that have overrun \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d like locusts, or lobbyists.)\n\nIt also may have been partly due to modesty from Iannucci about whether he can master the substance of American politics. It\u2019s even possible that he wanted to avoid the trap of demonizing the \u201cother\u201d side (from Iannucci\u2019s own politics, that may not have been easy for him). For most of the second and third seasons, it worked well: the focus on the personality types and the every-day-is-a-crisis atmosphere, together with the awesome writing, was enough to make the show the best one ever made about American politics.\n\n\u2018Veep\u2019 Has Reached Its Limits But this past season illustrated the limits of \u201cVeep\u2019s\u201d internal rules. The writing remained stellar, but too much of the show repeated the same themes. All the same people were still screwing everything up all the time, with a wonderfully eloquent chorus of profanity. This still resulted in its regular quota of permanently quotable lines (\u201cFuture Whatever,\u201d Amy\u2019s departing rant). The show introduced new characters and roles, but failed to capitalize on them. Hugh Laurie\u2019s glorious Tom James was introduced as an almost-decent vice-presidential nominee, Dan and Amy became lobbyists, and Selina even became president.\n\nThe writing remained stellar, but too much of the show repeated the same themes. But none of those functions realized their potential for new comedy. Dan and Amy\u2019s roles as lobbyists were underexplored (despite one memorable scene where Dan unctuously expresses his desire to \u201ctake zucchini to the next level\u201d when meeting with a vegetable-producing client) and even Selina\u2019s role as president didn\u2019t raise the scripted stakes for the inevitable screw-ups.\n\nIn fact, the past season\u2019s failure to raise its game inadvertently highlighted the one theme the show has struggled for its duration: balancing the inability of anyone to ever do anything right without raising the obvious question of \u201cHow the hell did they get to these top positions?\u201d \u201cVeep\u201d struck that balance reasonably well in its second and third seasons for many of the characters, especially Selina. There were still some exceptions (press secretary Mike McClintock would be eaten for lunch by any 21-year-old intern at the Free Beacon or Center for American Progress), but many of the characters actually showed that they had skills in addition to foibles.\n\nBut this past season, they resorted too much to the trope of, to paraphrase Amy\u2019s glorious parting rant, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t fill a bath without the Coast Guard having to be called in.\u201d They also had to resort too often to the show\u2019s secret weapon, which is Selina revealing herself to be a truly horrible person. This is incredibly useful in small doses (the best example being the season two premiere when Selina guilt-trips Amy into not going to her father\u2019s bedside on midterm election night when Amy\u2019s father may have suffered a stroke), but when overused, as it was this season, it is counterproductive.\n\nTime for \u2018Veep\u2019 to Add Some Political Substance Despite the laudable intentions of \u201cVeep\u2019s\u201d avoidance of political substance, the show can no longer afford to cut itself off from the motivations of policy. There is no need for them to be afraid of doing so. The writers need only watch \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d to see how it\u2019s done. What sets \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d apart is that it takes the substance of its subject matter seriously. Judge and his team recognize that taking the substance seriously opens up whole new sources for comedy. Yes, \u201cdown rounds\u201d and non-compete clauses can be used for comedy if you understand them, and the people who engage in them, well enough.\n\nWithout engaging the political substance of DC, \u2018Veep\u2019 can no longer portray DC\u2019s inhabitants well. Without engaging the political substance of DC, \u201cVeep\u201d can no longer portray DC\u2019s inhabitants well. It\u2019s not just that even the crassest political operators cannot be accurately portrayed without reference to the causes they serve (and in which they typically truly believe, regardless of how many compromises they make or checks they cash). Using policy substance as an indispensable part of the characters\u2019 roles also will show how the characters became so powerful in the first place, despite their serial failures.\n\nFor example, \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d has portrayed Erlich Bachman as a hilarious buffoon, but also shows his real strengths, charisma, and value to Pied Piper. Think of how he clearly presents their business plan to Peter Gregory in season one, securing the seed investment. It also provides additional context to mine for laughs: Selina\u2019s staff torpedoing a \u201cfamily\u201d bill is funny. It\u2019s even funnier if we know that Selina and her staff have been working for the exact policy proposals in that bill for decades, and they now have to undercut their own lives\u2019 work.\n\nIncompetence Is an Argument for Limited Government In fact, \u201cVeep\u201d is ideally designed to allow its creators to uncloak their (presumed) natural liberalism without being unfair to the other side in the manner of an Aaron Sorkin. As it is, Selina and her team clearly are liberal in a substance-less manner (cue the Hillary jokes), perhaps because despite their best efforts, the show\u2019s creators can\u2019t wrap their heads around any other political orientation. (For Hollywood, this represents progress.)\n\nEven if Selina Meyer is outed as a proud liberal, the show\u2019s merciless ethos would prevent it from devolving into a satirical \u2018West Wing.\u2019 But as Kyle Smith noted in 2013, the permanent incompetence of every character on the show is itself the best portrayal of the argument for limited government ever likely to emerge from Hollywood. So even if Selina Meyer is outed as a proud liberal, the show\u2019s merciless ethos would prevent it from devolving into a satirical \u201cWest Wing.\u201d At the risk of emulating George W. Bush\u2019s assessment of Vladimir Putin, when it comes to the makers of \u201cVeep,\u201d I trust the blackness of their hearts.\n\nWhile \u201cVeep\u201d avoids the \u201cpulled from the headlines\u201d pattern, it seems impeachable to avoid the material provided by the age of Obama. In fact, what is Obamacare, if not the greatest \u201cVeep\u201d storyline ever? The centerpiece of the liberal project of the last several decades, on which the administration bet its legacy, and nobody in the White House has any idea that the website may as well have been built by Bighead from \u201cSilicon Valley?\u201d\n\nThe compromises and struggle to get the bill passed, the utter chaos in passing the bill after Scott Brown\u2019s Senate election, the website fiasco and fix could easily get an entire season out of it. And the recent King v. Burwell decision showed how it could be mined over multiple seasons: nobody had any idea that the text of the bill contained what may have been a self-destruct device? If \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d can mine laughs out of the quest for some venture capital and intellectual property law, just imagine what \u201cVeep\u201d could do with, say, the Jonathan Gruber videos.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Wed, 08 Jul 2015 07:50:46 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "It\u2019s time for HBO\u2019s \u2018Veep' to dive into the substance of its surroundings.", "title": "What \u2018Veep\u2019 Can Learn From \u2018Silicon Valley\u2019", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Veep.jpg", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2015/07/08/what-veep-can-learn-from-silicon-valley/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "It\u2019s time for HBO\u2019s \u2018Veep' to dive into the substance of its surroundings.", "creator": "@FDRLST", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Veep.jpg"}, "title": "What \u2018Veep\u2019 Can Learn From \u2018Silicon Valley\u2019", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Television", "tag": "Armando Iannucci,Ben Cafferty,comedy,David Mandel,HBO,House of Cards,Julia Louis-Dreyfus,Mike Judge,Selina Meyer,Silicon Valley,VEEP", "published_time": "2015-07-08T07:50:46+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It\u2019s time for HBO\u2019s \u2018Veep' to dive into the substance of its surroundings."}, "article_summary": "Time for \u2018Veep\u2019 to Add Some Political Substance Despite the laudable intentions of \u201cVeep\u2019s\u201d avoidance of political substance, the show can no longer afford to cut itself off from the motivations of policy.\nWithout engaging the political substance of DC, \u201cVeep\u201d can no longer portray DC\u2019s inhabitants well.\nWithout engaging the political substance of DC, \u2018Veep\u2019 can no longer portray DC\u2019s inhabitants well.\nIf \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d can mine laughs out of the quest for some venture capital and intellectual property law, just imagine what \u201cVeep\u201d could do with, say, the Jonathan Gruber videos.\nThe showrunner of HBO\u2019s acclaimed comedy \u201cVeep,\u201d Armando Iannucci, recently announced he is leaving the show as of the end of its fourth season, which occurred last month."}
