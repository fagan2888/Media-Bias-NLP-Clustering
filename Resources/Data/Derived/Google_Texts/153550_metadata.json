He is laying out an agenda in step with the party\u2019s progressive wing and compatible with Warren\u2019s platform \u2013 reining in Wall Street banks, tackling college debt and creating a government-financed infrastructure jobs programme.\n\n\u201cI think our views are parallel on many, many issues,\u201d Sanders said in an interview with the Associated Press, describing Warren as a \u201cgood friend\u201d.\n\nSanders caucuses with the Democrats in Washington and is running for the Democratic nomination. He and the Democratic former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley are vying to become the primary alternative to Clinton. Much of the energy behind a Clinton alternative has been directed to drafting Warren, but she has repeatedly said she won\u2019t run.\n\nFor Sanders, a key question is electability. Clinton is in a commanding position by any measure. Yet his supporters in New Hampshire say his local ties and longstanding practice of holding town hall meetings and people-to-people campaigning \u2013 a staple in the nation\u2019s first primary state \u2013 could serve him well.\n\n\u201cToward the Vermont border it\u2019s like a love-fest for Bernie,\u201d said Jerry Curran, an Amherst, New Hampshire, Democratic activist who has been involved in the draft Warren effort. \u201cHe\u2019s not your milquetoast leftwinger. He\u2019s kind of a badass leftwinger.\u201d\n\nA self-described democratic socialist, Sanders has raised more than $4m since announcing in early May that he would be a presidential candidate. \u201cHe suggested in the interview that raising $50m for the primaries was a possibility. \u201cThat would be a goal,\u201d he said.\n\nHe rejects the notion that he\u2019s simply in the race to shape the debate.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton is a candidate, I am a candidate,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI suspect there will be other candidates. The people in this country will make their choice.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Senator Bernie Sanders says his campaign is funded by small, individual donations.

But he has been on the forefront of liberal causes as Clinton has seemed to be tacking to the left.\n\nClinton regularly refers to an economic deck stacked against American workers \u2013 rhetoric that offers comparisons to Warren\u2019s frequent description of the economic system being \u201crigged\u201d against middle-class families.\n\nSanders has joined with Warren to drive opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade proposal, arguing it would ship jobs overseas. Clinton has avoided taking a specific position on the trade deal.\n\nThe Vermont senator has introduced legislation to make tuition free at public colleges and universities, a major piece of Warren\u2019s agenda. The free tuition would be covered by a mix of state and federal money and paid for by higher taxes on Wall Street investment firms, hedge funds and other financial transactions. Clinton\u2019s campaign has signalled that she intends to make debt-free college a major piece of her campaign.\n\nSanders\u2019s disdain for big money in politics is also shared by liberals. Clinton frequently tells voters that she would back a constitutional amendment to overturn the supreme court decision allowing super Pacs to raise unlimited money. But Democratic super Pacs are already lining up behind her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to have a super Pac in this campaign,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI don\u2019t go to fundraisers where millionaires sit around the room and say here\u2019s a million, here\u2019s $5m for your super Pac. That\u2019s not my life. That\u2019s not my world. And I think the American people are saying that is not what our politics should be about.\u201d He said the money he\u2019s raised so far has come from more than 100,000 individual donors, giving an average of $42 each.\n\nOrganisers of the pro-Warren effort say Clinton may still win over many of their supporters. Charles Chamberlain, executive director of Vermont-based Democracy for America, said Sanders would \u201cfill the void\u201d for some of the voters hoping for Warren to run. But not for all.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re different people. They\u2019ve got different pluses, they\u2019ve got different minuses,\u201d Chamberlain said. \u201cSome of the people who want to see Elizabeth get in the race are going to Hillary. Some of them are going to go to Martin O\u2019Malley.\u201d O\u2019Malley is expected to announce his candidacy on Saturday.\n\nIf Sanders is the underdog, that\u2019s fine by him. During the 1970s, he lost four statewide elections as a third-party candidate, and then narrowly defeated a Democratic incumbent in 1981 to become Burlington\u2019s mayor.\n\n\u201cNobody \u2013 trust me \u2013 nobody thought I would defeat a five-term incumbent Democratic mayor,\u201d Sanders said, noting the winning margin of 10 votes.\n\nThe lessons, he said, are clear: \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "The Vermont senator \u2013 a \u2018badass leftwinger\u2019 \u2013 may scoop up Warren supporters and his personal style is likely to play well in neighbouring New Hampshire", "application-name": "The Guardian", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "The Vermont senator \u2013 a \u2018badass leftwinger\u2019 \u2013 may scoop up Warren supporters and his personal style is likely to play well in neighbouring New Hampshire", "title": "Bernie Sanders warns Democratic rivals for presidency: don't underestimate me", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/25/bernie-sanders-warns-democratic-rivals-underestimate-me", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b95bf17f81d822b3b4b2239d217a3eb6145b31a/0_193_2784_1670/2784.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=8136d404b8b5cfc475ab254e4bd05fab", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/may/25/bernie-sanders-warns-democratic-rivals-underestimate-me?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/25/bernie-sanders-warns-democratic-rivals-underestimate-me", "iphone": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/may/25/bernie-sanders-warns-democratic-rivals-underestimate-me?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9b95bf17f81d822b3b4b2239d217a3eb6145b31a/0_193_2784_1670/2784.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/may/25/bernie-sanders-warns-democratic-rivals-underestimate-me?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Bernie Sanders,US news,Democrats,US elections 2016,Hillary Clinton", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "US news", "tag": "Bernie Sanders,US news,Democrats,US elections 2016,Hillary Clinton", "published_time": "2015-05-25T13:34:57.000Z", "modified_time": "2016-05-26T21:53:28.000Z"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b95bf17f81d822b3b4b2239d217a3eb6145b31a/0_193_2784_1670/2784.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=379ff961c1a2a9c53a28f40a7ff6b255", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Bernie Sanders,US news,Democrats,US elections 2016,Hillary Clinton"}, "article_summary": "But Democratic super Pacs are already lining up behind her.\n\u201cHillary Clinton is a candidate, I am a candidate,\u201d Sanders said.\n\u201cNobody \u2013 trust me \u2013 nobody thought I would defeat a five-term incumbent Democratic mayor,\u201d Sanders said, noting the winning margin of 10 votes.\nFor Democrats who had hoped to lure the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren into a presidential campaign, independent senator Bernie Sanders might be the next best thing.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to have a super Pac in this campaign,\u201d Sanders said."}
