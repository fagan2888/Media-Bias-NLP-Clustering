It will emerge as a new asset class touching all aspects of society.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u201cPersonal Data: The Emergence of A New Asset Class\u201d presented February, 2011 at the World Economic Forum\n\nPersonal data surges from swollen data clouds and leaky Internet pipes, flooding the 21st Century digital highway with gigabytes of our private lives. We volunteer personal data through social media. But \u201cobserved\u201d data is captured and collected in bulk metadata program (such as cell phone location data) without our knowledge. Even more troubling is the kind of data that is \u201cinferred\u201d through analysis of data merged from multiple sources.\n\nDATA HARVESTING OR DATA RAPE?\n\nThe international debate about data privacy could be framed different ways.\n\nThe data harvester gleans data for seeds that germinate ideas\u2014good and bad. Harvest them all to eliminate the bad seeds so the good seeds can grow.\n\nData rape sounds more sinister. Internet service providers (ISPs) penetrate our personal computers through deep packet inspection. This technology enables ISPs to monitor the content of data packets in real-time. When you express interest on the Internet, the click of a mouse creates a cookie trail. These cookies are like booze, ecstasy and other drugs that make it easier for the college coed to score.\n\nIn December, the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation held a hearing to examine the data broker industry and how industry practices may impact consumers. Pam Dixon from the World Privacy Forum testified, stating data brokers commonly sold \u201clists of rape sufferers, victims of domestic violence, police officers\u2019 home addresses, people who suffer from genetic illnesses.\u201d She presented evidence of a \u201cRape Sufferers List\u201d that sold for 79 cents per name. The Wall Street Journal investigated with this story: \u201cData Mining to Recruit Sick People.\u201d\n\nData mining and lawfulness\n\nRegardless of the framing, when details of our personal lives are collected without consent, our privacy is violated. This is repugnant since we cannot finger the nameless and faceless perpetrators. The NSA argues that bulk data collection is lawful and necessary for national security. As Pam Dixon illustrated, controversies of data privacy go far beyond spy agencies.\n\nBehavioral profiling is a form of inferred data exploited by commercial interests. Media conglomerates and bloggers compete for readers to monetize digital content through \u201cbehaviorally targeted advertising.\u201d Campaigns strategically mine our hobbies, passions and vulnerabilities to micro-target a tailored message that effectively sells politics and products.\n\nMcKinsey Global Institute, a global management and consulting firm, describes BIG DATA as \u201cdatasets whose size is beyond the ability of typical database software tools to capture, store, manage and analyze.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a convenient definition. BIG DATA software tools create inferred data. And they are proprietary, of course. Who could audit or question inferred data\u2014especially if we have no access (let alone knowledge) that the BIG DATA is being collected.\n\n\u201cCompeting on information is no longer a luxury\u2014it\u2019s a matter of survival,\u201d writes Boris Evelson, VP and analyst of Forrester Research in his review of Predictive Analytics: The Power to Predict Who Will Click, Buy, Lie or Die. Predictive analytics and evidence-based analysis are touted to save lives and taxpayer dollars.Big government and big business have united\u2014often in formal public private partnerships\u2014to collect and mine BIG DATA.\n\nHIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) and FERPA (Family Education Rights and Privacy Act) are landmark laws intended to protect health and education privacy. There is \u201cno private right of action\u201d when unlawful access, use or disclosure of personal health information or student\u2019s protected information occurs. In other words, you can\u2019t sue under HIPAA or FERPA laws when your personal data has been compromised.\n\nRegulatory revisions have essentially gutted both HIPAA and FERPA. The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), a public interest research center, sued the US Department of Education for unlawful regulations of FERPA which allowed the \"release of student records for non-academic purposes and undercut parental and student consent provisions.\" The federal court dismissed the case, concluding EPIC lacked \u201cconstitutional standing.\u201d The fate would likely be the same for HIPAA.\n\nHIPAA and FERPA were gutted to make way for BIG DATA.\n\nBIG DATA = BIG MONEY\n\nOne thing is certain. There is BIG MONEY in BIG DATA. In 2012, private equity firm Veritas Capital paid $1.25 billion for the healthcare unit of Thomas Reuters Corporation. They re-christened their cash cow, Truven (a combination of the words \u201ctrusted\u201d and \u201cproven\u201d) Health Analytics.\n\nTruven Health crmViewTM Marketing Solutions boasts a \u201cdouble-digit ROI\u201d for Medford Providence Medical Center. (ROI for those who don\u2019t know business speak is return on investment.) In 2009, the hospital\u2019s chief medical officer sent a personalized letter to encourage visits with their primary care physician for a routine screening focused on \u201cstage of life\u201d procedures. The demographics: 1,489 insured female heads of household, aged 40 to 55 and who hadn\u2019t seen their primary care physician for two years. Ka-ching!\n\nNot to be outdone, IMS Health Holdings has just filed for a public stock offering. IMS Health brags that they\u2019ve collected \u201cover 85 percent of the world\u2019s prescriptions by sales revenue.\u201d According to ProPublica, IMS Health stores 10 petabytes (or 10 million gigabytes) of data that includes comprehensive, anonymous medical records from 400 million patients. This, no doubt, attracts the top 100 global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as clients. Ka-ching! Ka-ching!\n\nAs reported last year in Bloomberg News, Truven was the top purchaser of hospital discharge data. An accompanying infographic show IMS is not far behind. OptumInsight \u201cowns one of the deepest pools of health data on the planet.\u201d Seattle-based Milliman, a global actuarial firm that consults with insurance companies, is also no slouch. Milliman\u2019s spokesman declined further discussions, noting the company\u2019s data analysis methodology is proprietary.\n\nInferred data: Inferred motives\n\nIn 2008, the Federal Trade Commission found Milliman Inc. to have violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Since at least 2005, Milliman \u201chas marketed IntelliScript, a data aggregation service that provides individual medical profiles, including, but not limited to, prescription drug purchase histories of insurance applicants, to health and life insurance companies.\u201d\n\nWith prescription drug histories mined from pharmacy benefit managers, IntelliScript created a color-coded \u201cpharmacy risk score.\u201d Red codes, for example, included AIDS cocktail drugs and cancer medications. Milliman marketed instant access to personal drug profiles. As Mark Franzen, managing director of Milliman IntelliScript, stated, \u201cThat's the real 'value-add.\u2019\u201d\n\nA value-add for patients? Tim Sparapani, senior legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union thought otherwise, saying products Milliman markets are a \"commodification\" of electronic medical records by third parties.\n\nIngenix is another case study. A subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, Ingenix was the nation\u2019s largest provider of healthcare billing information.\n\nIn 2008, then New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo conducted an \u201cindustry-wide investigation into a scheme by health insurers to defraud consumers by manipulating reimbursement rates.\u201c Ingenix had rigged rates for out-of-network doctors. When \u201creasonable and customary\u201d reimbursements were lowballed, patients were forced to absorb a higher share of the costs.\n\nHealthcare.gov defines balance billing:\n\nWhen a provider bills you for the difference between the provider\u2019s charge and the allowed amount. For example, if the provider\u2019s charge is $100 and the allowed amount is $70, the provider may bill you for the remaining $30. A preferred provider may not balance bill you for covered services.\n\nBalance billing does not accrue toward the out-of-pocket maximum with enactment of the Not-So-Affordable-Care-Act.\n\nThe American Medical Association maintains a litigation center and a database specifically for Ingenix lawsuits. In April 2011, UnitedHealth Group rebranded Ingenix as OptumInsight. The CEO of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiary OptumInsight, n\u00e9e Ingenix, is Stephen J. Hemsley. According to Forbes, he is the top paid CEO in America, having earned over $120 million in the past five years.\n\nBIG DATA and Oregon\u2019s All Payer All Claims Database(s)\n\nWhat has any of this got to do with Oregon? A lot. To be continued\u2026\n\nDr. Kris Alman retired from healthcare to become a citizen activist for a healthier democracy.
