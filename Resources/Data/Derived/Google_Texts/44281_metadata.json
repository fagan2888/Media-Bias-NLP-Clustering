The stigma alone is a major barrier. Not to mention concerns about personal safety.\n\nPlus, prisons are often in out-of-the-way places.\n\nNow, recruiting and retaining prison healthcare workers may get even harder because of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nInmate healthcare is a touchy subject because inmates sometimes have better access to care than many poor people on the outside.\n\nBut the courts have determined adequate medical care is a constitutional right for prisoners under the Eighth Amendment. That\u2019s the one that bars cruel and unusual punishment. And if prisons don\u2019t provide adequate care they get in serious legal trouble.\n\nA revolving door\n\nThe Washington Corrections Center is about 30 miles northwest of Olympia. In the center of this sprawling 1960s-era complex is the prison infirmary where Eric Larsen works as an Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner.\n\nLarsen is doing a check-up on an offender named Bob. We\u2019ve agreed not to use his last name for healthcare privacy reasons.\n\nBob been incarcerated here for seven years. After his check-up, he agrees to talk with me.\n\nI asked if he noticed a lot of turnover in the medical staff here in seven years.\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d he says. \u201cSome people are just in and out you know.\u201d\n\nLike prison itself, correctional healthcare is a revolving door. Eric Larsen\u2019s been working here five years \u2014 longer than a lot of his colleagues.\n\n\u201cI did a mid-life career change,\u201d he says. \u201cI used to be a state Fish and Wildlife biologist.\u201d\n\nLarsen says he decided to take this job largely because he gets loan repayment help through a national health service program. Plus, he gets to continue to build on the state retirement he earned as a longtime Fish and Wildlife employee.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just been a benefit that I feel fortunate to be able to take advantage of,\u201d says Larsen.\n\nHigh vacancy rates\n\nAdvanced Registered Nurse Practitioners like Larsen are among the hardest to recruit. Psychiatrists are the hardest. In some Washington lock-ups, healthcare job vacancy rates are 25 even 40 percent. Expensive, temporary contract workers often fill in the gaps.\n\nKevin Bovenkamp is assistant secretary for health services at Washington\u2019s Department of Corrections. He describes trying to keep up with the turnover as like trying to speed date while on a treadmill.\n\n\u201cYou hire one and some days you lose two, maybe you hire two and you lose two,\u201d says Bovenkamp.\n\nAnd now, with Obamacare coming on line, he\u2019s pretty sure it\u2019s going to get even harder. Expanded insurance coverage will mean more jobs in the healthcare industry. The American Correctional Association has warned that the Affordable Care Act may \u201csignificantly strain\u201d the primary care workforce available to prison systems.\n\n\u201cI believe they\u2019re going to have a lot of trouble,\u201d says Donna Strugar-Fritsch, a consultant in California who works with prison healthcare managers nationwide.\n\n\u201cAnd what I\u2019ve been suggesting is that they take the time now to start looking at the efficiencies of their processes so as these shortages emerge they are able to do more with fewer people.\u201d\n\nStrugar-Fritsch says if prison systems don\u2019t get smarter about how they deliver healthcare, \u201cThey will have unfilled positions which turn into lags in patient care which turn into bad outcomes which turn into lawsuits.\u201d\n\nImproving efficiency, avoiding lawsuits\n\nAs it is, Washington\u2019s Department of Corrections has paid out more than $5 million in medical negligence claims since 2000 for everything from the loss of a testicle due to delayed treatment to a suicide that might have been prevented through better treatment and monitoring.\n\nIndividual claims are one thing. Class action lawsuits and federal intervention quite another. This fall, Idaho\u2019s Department of Correction settled a decades-old healthcare lawsuit brought by inmates. And in 2005, California\u2019s prison health system was put into federal receivership.\n\nBovencamp is all too aware of the troubles elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThe goal is not to get in a situation where we\u2019re struggling and somebody else is telling us how we should do our healthcare.\u201d\n\nBovencamp says the Washington Department of Corrections is currently undertaking several efforts to improve healthcare efficiency so it can operate with fewer people. The agency is also looking to recruit doctors from overseas. And there\u2019s talk of paying hiring and retention bonuses.\n\nBack in the infirmary at the Washington Corrections Center, Eric Larsen pauses at a nurse\u2019s station between patients.\n\nI ask him what his level of job satisfaction is working at a prison everyday.\n\n\u201cThere are challenges working in a prison environment,\u201d says Larsen. \u201cThey revolve mostly around access to patients, they revolve around the issues of safety.\u201d\n\nLarsen says he actually feels safer working in a prison than he did in an ER. But there\u2019s a price that comes with that security. An inmate might not make an appointment because a rival gang member is in the infirmary at the same time.\n\nLarsen says feels good about the work he does. Healthy inmates are better behaved and since the vast majority are eventually released, he sees a value in sending them back into society in good health.", "article_metadata": {"author": "Austin Jenkins", "og": {"url": "http://www.opb.org/news/article/npr-recruiting-prison-health-care-workers-could-get-harder-under-affordable-care-act/", "image": "http://www.opb.org/images/fetch/c_fill,g_center,h_300,q_90,w_400/http%3A//mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/northwestnews/files/201312/122313AJ_PrisonHealthCare.jpg%3Fs%3D12", "description": "Recruiting and retaining prison healthcare workers may get even harder because of the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Recruiting Prison Health Care Workers Could Get Harder Under Affordable Care Act"}, "twitter": {"description": "<p>It&rsquo;s no easy task to find doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals to take a job in a prison.
