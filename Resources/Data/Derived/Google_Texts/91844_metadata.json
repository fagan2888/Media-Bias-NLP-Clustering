We need the Supreme Court to decide this case so that American merchants and their customers stop paying billions of dollars more than they should per year to the big banks,\" said NACS President and CEO Henry Armour.\n\nThe NRF has argued that the 21-cent figure included costs that went beyond those allowed under the legislation and filed suit against the Fed in U.S. District Court in 2011, along with other retail groups.\n\nAll of the groups filing the petition were plaintiffs in the original lawsuit.\n\nIn July 2013, Judge Richard Leon ruled in the NRF\u2019s favor and ordered the Fed to recalculate the cap at a lower level, but the Fed appealed.\n\nIn March, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia overturned Leon\u2019s ruling, citing \u201cambiguity\u201d in the 2010 law and saying the Fed based the cap on a \u201creasonable interpretation\u201d of the measure.\n\n\u201cCongress originally passed a law that was designed to lower swipe fees paid by customers and merchants, but the final Federal Reserve rule disregarded the legislative language and actually raised rates on many transactions,\" said FMI President and CEO Leslie Sarasin.\n\n\"Our food retailers and wholesalers consistently serve their customers based on a simple merchandising strategy \u2014 low markups and high volume \u2013 and these excessive swipe fees exceed the industry\u2019s one-percent net profit on shoppers\u2019 orders.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Several retail and merchants groups on Monday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review a March ruling that upheld the Federal Reserve\u2019s debit card swipe fee rules.", "description": "Several retail and merchants groups on Monday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review a March ruling that upheld the Federal Reserve\u2019s debit card swipe fee rules.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Vicki Needham", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Several retail and merchants groups on Monday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review a March ruling that upheld the Federal Reserve\u2019s debit card swipe fee rules.", "title": "Business groups ask Supreme Court to review swipe fee decision", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/215454-business-groups-ask-supreme-court-to-review-swipe-fee-decision", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/215454-business-groups-ask-supreme-court-to-review-swipe-fee-decision", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-08-18T20:08-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Vicki Needham", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-18T20:08:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "keywords": "Food Marketing Institute, Debit card, Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Federal Reserve System, National Retail Federation, Payment systems, Swipe fees,,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/215454-business-groups-ask-supreme-court-to-review-swipe-fee-decision", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Several retail and merchants groups on Monday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review a March ruling that upheld the Federal Reserve\u2019s debit card swipe fee rules.", "card": "summary", "title": "Business groups ask Supreme Court to review swipe fee decision"}, "dcterms.title": "Business groups ask Supreme Court to review swipe fee decision"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0a7e\"", "article_summary": "Several retail and merchants groups on Monday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review a March ruling that upheld the Federal Reserve\u2019s debit card swipe fee rules.\n\"Unfortunately, the Fed overrode the language of the law and blunted the positive impact of reform.\nIn July 2013, Judge Richard Leon ruled in the NRF\u2019s favor and ordered the Fed to recalculate the cap at a lower level, but the Fed appealed.\nAll of the groups filing the petition were plaintiffs in the original lawsuit.\n\u201cWhen a federal agency blatantly disregards the clear intent of legislation passed by Congress and signed into law by the president, that\u2019s a dispute that cannot be ignored.\""}
