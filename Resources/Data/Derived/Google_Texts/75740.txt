BrightNest

Did you know you can unstick a zipper with Windex? Or loosen a lid with flour. Or get grossed out by the light switch, which has 217 bacteria particles per square inch. Who knew housecleaning could be so… fascinating? BrightNest, that’s who! This colorful site dug deep into everyday chores to glean tips that may actually be useful at least once in your life. That simple concept attracted Angie’s List, which acquired BrightNest for $2.65 million in August 2013. The two sites now share content.
