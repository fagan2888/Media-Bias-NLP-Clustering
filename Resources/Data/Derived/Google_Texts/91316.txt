Minneapolis, MN

A woman has died after falling off a ladder at an abandoned Minneapolis grain elevator.



The woman was exploring the Bunge Tower, a vacant grain elevator in Minneapolis' Como neighborhood, when she fell off a ladder, crashed through a wooden floor and plummeted into a 30-foot steel bin Saturday night.



A Minneapolis Fire Department technical crew pulled the woman out around 10:30 p.m. It took an hour and a half for rescuers to bring the woman down the 10-story building, a rescue complicated by rain. She was taken to Hennepin County Medical Center, but the fire department says she died from her severe injuries. The woman's name has not been released.



In 2006, a 20-year-old University of Minnesota student died when she fell from the same elevator.
