No, I\u2019m not kidding:\n\nSixty-four percent of bronze plans offered in Dallas, for example, require policyholders to meet the full deductible before insurance coverage kicks in, according to the eHealth/KHN analysis, which included all insurers except one, Molina Healthcare.

Those include some vaccinations, mammograms and other cancer screenings, contraception, including birth control pills, and periodic physicals.

But because they\u2019re new to health insurance, they may be in for a rude shock: It doesn\u2019t cover everything.\n\nThere are deductibles, for example \u2014 the amount of money you have to spend out of pocket before coverage kicks in \u2014 which can be very high with \u201cbronze\u201d Obamacare plans, the cheapest kind. There are also co-payments for office visits, as well as co-insurance, the percentage of medical expenses you have to pay even if most are covered by your insurance.\n\nThere\u2019s no way to know how big an issue this could be before January arrives \u2014 but if newly insured people think they\u2019re getting free health care, or just think the deductibles are too high, they could be disappointed with their first experiences with Obamacare.\n\nBack in June 2013, Megan McArdle shared a pastor/reader\u2019s portrait of the decision-making of some Americans who, for all of their other wonderful qualities, aren\u2019t so great at considering long-term consequences, deferred gratification, cost-benefit analysis, and other hard financial realities:\n\nI work with what I\u2019d call median Americans. Incomes right around the median. Family structure and dysfunction right around the median. You get the picture.

The ACA and every wonk assumes rational people who can make good financial decisions. Instead what you have is people with $100K of school debt because it compounded when they stopped paying it, who are leasing a new car, who have an interest only mortgage (or a HELOC to help them pay the original mortgage), who have at least 3 credit cards maxed, maintain a pay-day loan they got scammed into, and yet find cable with HBO and an iPhone 5 with all you can eat plan necessities. It is not that on a median salary it is not possible to live a good and prudent life; it just requires some restraint and a minimum amount of simple rules. (Rules like Dave Ramsey talks about, or Benjamin Franklin divorced from the Christian content). But this is what the ACA mandate and cost is going to mean to many of these people: do I keep HBO & Cable, my iPhone, or buy medical insurance? Which bill that I already have must be done without? They will refuse to even think about that. On top of that, if they recognize Obamacare at all what they think it means is \u201cuniversal free health care\u201d with emphasis on the free.
