That is double the number that state police said were on the ground on Saturday.\n\nA secure perimeter was established around the area of the sighting and roadblocks were set up, Cerretto said at a brief press conference. He made no mention of other sightings in the area.\n\nThe Buffalo News reported that a civilian told police that he believed he had seen two men fitting the descriptions of the convicts walking along a road in Friendship on Sunday morning.\n\nThe newspaper did not disclose how it learned about the report, and a spokesman for the New York State Police declined comment on it.\n\nThe reported sightings of Matt, 48, and Sweat, 35, follow the suspension of corrections officer Gene Palmer at Clinton in connection with the escape.\n\nHis lawyer, Andrew Brockway, said Palmer has cooperated with investigators, who questioned him for 14 hours on Saturday.\n\n\"Any information he has that will aid in the capture of Matt and Sweat will be given to law enforcement,\" Brockway told Reuters in an email. \"He looks forward to going back to work as soon as possible.\"\n\nJoyce Mitchell, 51, a training supervisor in the prison tailor shop, is charged with helping the inmates escape by giving them tools.\n\nThe two inmates cut through their cell walls and crawled through a steam pipe before emerging from a manhole outside the prison, authorities said. The pair was discovered missing during the morning bed check on June 6.\n\n(Reporting by Suzannah Gonzales in Chicago)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "(Reuters) - Hundreds of law enforcement officers stepped up their hunt in western New", "title": "Hunt for escaped convicts heats up near New York-Pennsylvania line", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/06/21/Hunt-escaped-murderers-heats-near-New-York-Pennsylania-line", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-new-york-prisoners_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/06/21/Hunt-escaped-murderers-heats-near-New-York-Pennsylania-line", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-new-york-prisoners_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "(Reuters) - Hundreds of law enforcement officers stepped up their hunt in western New", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The newspaper did not disclose how it learned about the report, and a spokesman for the New York State Police declined comment on it.\n\"We will continue to search this area until all leads have been exhausted,\" New York State Police Major Michael Cerretto said on Sunday.\nState police received a call early Saturday afternoon from a witness who spotted two men with descriptions similar to the escaped convicts, Richard Matt and David Sweat, on a railroad line in Friendship, Cerretto said.\nThe search in Friendship was winding down by Sunday night, but increased patrols will stay in the area, New York State Police spokesman Beau Duffy told Reuters.\nAbout 300 law enforcement officers were searching the area, along New York's so-called southern tier, near the border with Pennsylvania, Cerretto said."}
