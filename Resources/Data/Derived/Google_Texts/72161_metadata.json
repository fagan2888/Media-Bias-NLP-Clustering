Sadly, lawmakers were mostly just standing by and gawking at the approaching train wreck. Some even cheered it along. But now that they realize the new rules will apply to them, too, many want to pump the brakes.\n\nFive million salaried workers will be directly impacted by the Obama administration\u2019s decision to expand overtime pay mandates. Under this new rule, salaried employees making between $23,660 and $50,440 per year will be entitled to time-and-a-half pay if they work more than 40 hours per week. Sounds great for employees, right? That\u2019s only until they realize their base salary may fall, and their hours may be reduced. They will also have to start punching a time clock.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis rule\u2014much like a minimum wage hike\u2014would jack up the cost of employing people. No matter how well-meaning such rules might be, the end result will likely be less work and less base pay. A new study by George Mason University\u2019s Donald Boudreaux and SUNY-Purchase College\u2019s Liya Palagashvili\u2014 published by my employer the Mercatus Center\u2014predicts that such rules will lead to fewer hours worked, lower salaries, increased portions of income subject to tax, a less flexible work environment (goodbye telecommuting!), or some combination of these.\n\nAnd guess who has a large workforce that would fall prey to these rules? Congress. The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 requires that Congress comply with the overtime pay standards established under the Fair Labor Standards Act (Congressional Accountability Act, PL. No. 104-1, Sec. 203 citing to 29 U.S.C. 206 (a)(1) and (d), 207, 212(c)). Many who work for Congress\u2014such as staff assistants, press assistants, and legislative aids\u2014more often than not\u2014work long hours and make less than $50,000 annually.\n\nAs Rep. Alcee Hasting (D-Fla.) a supporter of the rule, told Bloomberg BNA recently, \u201cWe don\u2019t have a set-hour kind of situation here; some kids work 12, 14, 16 hours a day, weekends.\u201d But he adds, \u201cI don\u2019t see how we could pay overtime\u201d for the \u201c17 or 18 people that each of us is allowed to have\u2014that\u2019s problematic for me.\u201d\n\nIrony of all ironies, the feeling is shared by many Democrats who overwhelmingly support the proposed expansion of overtime pay\u2014at least, perhaps, until they realize they may also have to live by it. As the Bloomberg BNA Daily Labor Report notes, it leaves these vocal supporters of the rule in an awkward position of having to acknowledge that \u201cI can\u2019t afford to give raises to the kids\u201d or that \u201cit\u2019s impractical to be paying overtime.\u201d\n\nThe newspaper reports that \u201c\u2018Democratic chiefs of staff are freaking out\u2019 about finding room in their budget for overtime wages\u201d and fear that an overtime mandate will result in having to send staffers home at 5 p.m.\n\nNo kidding. Too expensive and leading to less work for employees is exactly whateconomists and employers have said about the consequences of the rule from the beginning. That\u2019s also why Republicans opposed the rule based on the increased burden it would place on employers\u2014and are considering legislation to send the DOL back to the drawing board.\n\nUnfortunately, the DOL, which ignored the plea of employers and economists, is rushing to finalize the rule. If it succeeds, employers and their employees around the country will start feeling the pain. Congress, however, may try a different route.\n\nJust like the Los Angeles unions who\u2014after fighting for years to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour and won\u2014are now trying to be exempt from having to pay the higher wage themselves, would anyone be surprised if Congress tried to find a way around the new overtime rule? If you\u2019ll recall, Congress tried to exempt itself from the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAs former Congressman Jim Moran Jim MoranBottom Line Congress and new labor laws: what goes around comes around Ten House seats Dems hope Trump will tilt MORE (D-Va.) rightly noted, \u201cThe problem is that this is the body that makes the laws that others have to comply with, so it\u2019s a little awkward when you exempt yourself from the very laws that you\u2019re expecting others in the public and private sector to comply with.\u201d Yes, awkward.\n\nCongress could also seek to increase its own budget to cover additional overtime pay. In that scenario, both workers and taxpayers would suffer. With a projected $660 billion deficit this year alone, and over $19 trillion in debt, simply spending more isn\u2019t a great solution, either. However well-intentioned the regulations to make employers pay more for labor may be, their consequences will have the opposite effects on those they aim to help. A better solution is for the DOL to drop its rules and move on.\n\nVeronique de Rugy is a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.title": "Congress and new labor laws: what goes around comes around", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.modified": "2016-05-10T15:29-04:00", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "title": "Congress and new labor laws: what goes around comes around", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/labor/279066-congress-and-new-labor-laws-what-goes-around-comes-around", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-10T15:29:47-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/labor/279066-congress-and-new-labor-laws-what-goes-around-comes-around", "dcterms.date": "2016-05-09T12:00-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Bill Rehkopf", "author": "Veronique de Rugy", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Jim Moran,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-09T12:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-10T15:29:47-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/labor/279066-congress-and-new-labor-laws-what-goes-around-comes-around", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary", "title": "Congress and new labor laws: what goes around comes around"}}, "article_summary": "Five million salaried workers will be directly impacted by the Obama administration\u2019s decision to expand overtime pay mandates.\nThe Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 requires that Congress comply with the overtime pay standards established under the Fair Labor Standards Act (Congressional Accountability Act, PL.\nHowever well-intentioned the regulations to make employers pay more for labor may be, their consequences will have the opposite effects on those they aim to help.\nCongress could also seek to increase its own budget to cover additional overtime pay.\nFor months, employers around the country have been sounding the alarm about the Department of Labor\u2019s new regulation to expand overtime pay."}
