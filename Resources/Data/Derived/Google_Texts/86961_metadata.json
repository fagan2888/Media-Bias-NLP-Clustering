Messi, getting a rare touch, quickly moved the ball toward his dangerous left foot and fired a curling shot just beyond the reach of the diving goalkeeper and into the left corner of the net.\n\nUp until that point, he had been kept quiet by Iran\u2019s stoic defending, while Argentina had at times been exposed to counterattacks.\n\nIran had several chances to win it, especially in the second half. The best of those opportunities came in the 67th minute, when midfielder Ashkan Dejagah\u2019s powerful header from close range was tipped just over the bar by Argentina goalkeeper Sergio Romero.\n\n\u201cWe know that it would be a difficult, tense match,\u201d Romero said. \u201cThank God I could get my hand on the ball and it didn\u2019t go in.\n\n\u201cMessi then rubbed his magic lamp and we won.\u201d\n\nEarlier, lone striker Reza Ghoochannejhad\u2019s header from close range was saved by Romero after a cross from the right. He later missed a chance for a late winner when his shot was again saved by Romero.\n\nBefore the match, Iran faced criticism for its defensive tactics after a dour 0-0 draw against Nigeria. But before Messi\u2019s strike, Iranian and Brazilian fans were singing \u201cOle, ole, ole, ole, Iran Iran!\u201d in recognition of the team\u2019s attempts to score a winner.\n\nBut Messi denied Iran what would have ranked as its greatest result by drawing with the former world champions.\n\nThe victory sent the pro-Argentina crowd into raptures and most of them stayed in the stands well after the match, chanting and waving scarves and flags, and watching highlights \u2014 including Messi\u2019s goal \u2014 on the big screens.\n\nIt almost looked like Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella\u2019s decision to return to an attacking lineup would backfire. In Argentina\u2019s 2-1 win against Bosnia-Herzegovina in the Group F opener, Sabella started with a more defensive 5-3-2 lineup with only two strikers.\n\nHe then changed to a 4-3-3 formation in the second half \u2014 a system favored by Messi \u2014 and he continued with that lineup at the Mineirao Stadium in Belo Horizonte. In the first half, it looked like Argentina would score at least one goal, but Iran\u2019s defense stood firm and the South Americans nearly paid for several missed chances until Messi\u2019s winner.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Lionel Messi\u2019s late goal gives Argentina 1-0 World Cup win over Iran", "title": "Lionel Messi\u2019s late goal gives Argentina 1-0 World Cup win over Iran", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/21/lionel-messis-late-goal-gives-argentina-1-0-world-cup-win-over-iran/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140621_122721_lionel-messi-argentina-iran-celebration.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140621_122721_lionel-messi-argentina-iran-celebration.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-21T12:20:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:27:31+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0475\"", "article_summary": "But before Messi\u2019s strike, Iranian and Brazilian fans were singing \u201cOle, ole, ole, ole, Iran Iran!\u201d in recognition of the team\u2019s attempts to score a winner.\nBefore the match, Iran faced criticism for its defensive tactics after a dour 0-0 draw against Nigeria.\nIran had several chances to win it, especially in the second half.\nBut Messi denied Iran what would have ranked as its greatest result by drawing with the former world champions.\nIran had defended solidly throughout the game and also took the match to Argentina in the second half, creating several chances to win the Group F match and cause a tournament sensation."}
