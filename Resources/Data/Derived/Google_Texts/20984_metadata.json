Maher is known for his anti-religious rhetoric and receives backlash from groups that he criticizes. Usually Maher attacks conservative values, but from time to time, he attacks his own liberal base by challenging them to see religion in a different light.\n\n\u201cThis idea that all religions share the same values is bull***t and we need to call it bull***t... if you are in this religion (Islam), you probably do have values that are at odds (with American values). This is what liberals don\u2019t want to recognize,\u201d Maher said.\n\nWarning (Language):\n\nMaher also points out an inconvenient truth that while most Muslim countries do not consist of terror groups, there are many within those countries who are sympathetic towards terror groups.\n\nThere is growing belief that the more accepting Americans are towards Islam, then more moderate countries like Indonesia will join in and help eradicate the more radical views of Islam. \u201cWhat about Indonesia? The moderate country of Indonesia (where) only 18 percent believe in honor killings. Really? One out of five people in the country that you\u2019re holding up as the moderate country believes if a woman is raped, we blame and kill her?\u201d Maher said.\n\nFor as much as Bill Maher gets wrong, he is right on this issue. All religions are not the same.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Last Friday, Bill Maher was on his weekly show, \"Real Time\", when he openly criticized the notion that Muslims share the same values as other religions..05/26/2016 19:13:07PM EST.", "author": "Justin Holcomb", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Last Friday, Bill Maher was on his weekly show, \"Real Time\", when he openly criticized the notion that Muslims share the same values as other religions.", "title": "Bill Maher Criticizes Liberals for Believing that all of Islam is Peaceful", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/justinholcomb/2015/11/23/bill-maher-criticizes-islam-gets-slammed-by-liberal-panel-n2084414", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/11/23/3.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Last Friday, Bill Maher was on his weekly show, \"Real Time\", when he openly criticized the notion that Muslims share the same values as other religions.", "title": "Bill Maher Criticizes Liberals for Believing that all of Islam is Peaceful", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/justinholcomb/2015/11/23/bill-maher-criticizes-islam-gets-slammed-by-liberal-panel-n2084414", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/11/23/3.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Bill Maher Criticizes Liberals for Believing That All of Islam is Peaceful, Justin Holcomb , Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "There is growing belief that the more accepting Americans are towards Islam, then more moderate countries like Indonesia will join in and help eradicate the more radical views of Islam.\nThe moderate country of Indonesia (where) only 18 percent believe in honor killings.\nLast Friday, Bill Maher was on his weekly show, \"Real Time\", when he openly criticized the notion that Muslims share the same values as other religions.\nOne out of five people in the country that you\u2019re holding up as the moderate country believes if a woman is raped, we blame and kill her?\u201d Maher said.\nMaher is known for his anti-religious rhetoric and receives backlash from groups that he criticizes."}
