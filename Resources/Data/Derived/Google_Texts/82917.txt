Abbott Laboratories said it will sell its developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business to Mylan Inc. in a $5.3 billion deal that includes the formation of a new publicly traded company.

Abbott ABT, +1.84% will receive equity ownership of roughly 105 million shares, or about 21%, in a newly formed entity that will combine Mylan’s MYL, +0.57% existing business and Abbott’s developed markets pharmaceuticals business, Abbott said Monday.

The new entity will be a publicly traded company, Abbott added.

The developed markets portion of this business generated roughly $2 billion in sales in 2013, the company said, adding that Abbott will retain its branded generics pharmaceuticals business and products in emerging markets, as well as its other businesses and products in developed markets.

The deal gives Abbott additional strategic flexibility, said Chairman and Chief Executive Miles D. White, adding that the company’s branded generics pharmaceuticals business will focus on emerging markets.

The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2015, after which, Abbott said it expects its sales growth rate will be 1% higher and the growth rate of its ongoing net income will be more than 2% higher.
