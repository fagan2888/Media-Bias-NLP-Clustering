Patrick Meehan, R-7th Dist., of Chadds Ford.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a career politician,\u201d Casacio said. \u201cI\u2019m not a Pat Meehan. He\u2019s a nice guy and all that. I\u2019m going to say what I\u2019m going to do and do what I say.\u201d\n\nCasacio\u2019s family business, N.C. Construction Corp. based in Huntingdon Valley, Pa., owns and manages shopping centers throughout the area.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was his involvement in the campaign of Montgomery County Commissioner Joe Gale last year, however, that encouraged him to run for office.\n\n\u201cWe were waking up in the morning and not really feeling good about things,\u201d Casacio said. \u201cWe were sitting down and we were saying, \u2018What can we do to move the dial one click?\u2019\u201d\n\nSo, he said a group of like-minded individuals decided to support Gale, an independent Republican.\n\n\u201cJoe started out like a son to me,\u201d Casacio said of the 26-year-old. \u201cAt the end of this campaign, he was an inspiration to me. He took physical threats, verbal abuse. I said, \u2018This is not America.\u2019 I was very impressed that this young man who stayed true to his convictions, stayed true to his values, he won.\u201d\n\nOver that campaign, Casacio said he enjoyed speaking before crowds.\n\n\u201cI must\u2019ve given 35 speeches,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople liked what I said.\u201d\n\nSo he\u2019s chosen to give his own congressional campaign a try.\n\n\u201cIt seems like no one is talking about what we can accomplish ... to make America great,\u201d he said. \u201cConservative values are not being sold correctly.\u201d\n\nSome of his key issues include immigration, the debt and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWith regard to immigration, Casacio said, \u201cThe reality is the Constitution is not a suicide pact. If we don\u2019t have control of our borders ... then we are fools for doing that. There has to be a way that we can start preventing these people from coming here who want to do us harm.\u201d\n\nIn addition, he said the national debt needs to be addressed in a substantial way.\n\n\u201cThe more you increase debt, the less we have, inflation takes over,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody has to work hard.\u201d\n\nCasacio also criticized the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWho would think health care would be cheaper if we layer another bureaucracy on top if it?\u201d he said.\n\nOn the other hand, he said conservatives and liberals need to work to try to get a consensus.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to message my ideas,\u201d Casacio said, adding that he also plans to sell his viewpoint to people while also taking their perspectives under consideration.\n\nVirginia Davis, Meehan\u2019s campaign spokeswoman, commented on the challenge by focusing on the incumbent\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cPat Meehan has a proven record of working with both parties on issues that create jobs in our community, hold D.C. accountable and keep our families safe,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s protecting our refinery jobs, expanding research into curing disease, or getting answers from the VA, he\u2019s broken through the gridlock in Washington and gotten results. He\u2019s a principled leader committed to fighting for hardworking families in southeastern Pennsylvania.\u201d\n\nOnce the Republican nomination is cast, the winner will face a November contest against one of the two Democrats vying for the spot, Mary Ellen Balchunis or Bill Golderer.\n\nWith regards to Casacio entering the race, Golderer said, \u201cI\u2019m focused on my own campaign right now and not terribly concerned with what\u2019s going on in the Republican primary. However, it seems to me that this just underscores what we\u2019ve been saying all along: people are frustrated with Congress and they\u2019re frustrated with Congressman Meehan. Congress is broken and Pat Meehan offers no solutions. I look forward to being part of the solution.\u201d\n\nBalchunis did not respond to a request for comment.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News, Norristown news, PA news, US news, world news.", "title": "Montgomery County businessman Stan Casacio seeks GOP nod for U.S. Rep.
