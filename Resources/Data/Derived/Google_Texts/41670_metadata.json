After all, you hear about Facebook scams every day.\n\nSome are silly, like a recent \u201cChristmas bonus\u201d scam that probably didn\u2019t fool too many people. Facebook is giving away money for Christmas? Unlikely.\n\nStill, you can\u2019t just dismiss Facebook scams. Some of them are costly, like a woman who lost $44,550 to help her would-be fiance return to America.\n\nNow, there\u2019s word of a Facebook scam involving a tempting coupon, to save money at a major grocery store. It sounds like a harmless scam, but it isn\u2019t. In fact, it\u2019s scary because you could end up sharing your personal information with cybercriminals.\n\nYou may see a 40% off Kroger coupon on Facebook. It\u2019s easy to get fooled. See the image above.\n\nThis Facebook scam gets points for being convincing. It looks like a Kroger coupon, saying you can save 40% on your shopping until the end of the year, and all you have to do is say \u201cthanks\u201d under comments.\n\nThe problem begins when you click on the coupon, so you can print it out. If you do, you\u2019re taken to a bogus site.\n\nThere, you\u2019re asked to fill out personal information. There may also be links that would infect your device with malware.\n\nKroger posted a warning about the coupon scam on Facebook (see photo above): \u201cThis is currently an unauthorized 40% off all purchase in store offer circulating.\n\n\u201cThis giveaway is not affiliated with, or supported by the Kroger Co. in any way. We recommend not engaging with sites that offer links to the coupon, or providing them with any personal information. Our team is actively working with Facebook and domain service providers to address the concern.\u201d\n\nNote: To stay safe online, and protect your ID, visit the Komando Security Center for tips, including information about anti-virus software programs.\n\nOn the Kim Komando Show, the nation\u2019s largest weekend radio talk show, Kim takes calls and dispenses advice on today\u2019s digital lifestyle, from smartphones and tablets to online privacy and data hacks.
