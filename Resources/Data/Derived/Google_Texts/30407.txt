Addressing the American Association for Cancer Research on Wednesday, Vice President Joe Biden struck a similar tone to past remarks about the Cancer Moonshot Initiative, stressing the importance that research be immediately available once it is published.

Biden reiterated that he hopes the initiative will spur signifiant progress toward curing cancer over the next five years, and that he hopes to bring together people and resources and break down silos to advance research. The culture associated with research overall is detrimental to furthering results, he said.

“We slow down our best young minds by making them spend years and years in the lab before they can get their own grants,” he said. “And when they do, the grant, they spend a third of their time writing a grant that takes months to be approved and awarded.”

When research is published, the data is typically inaccessible for at least a year, because academic journals keep the data for some time after a report is published. Much of that research is funded by taxpayers, he said. Other research and data that is publicly available can lead to advancements, such as breast cancer research that stemmed from open-source code NASA research that was used to clarify images from the Hubble telescope.

While the current research system has clearly led to some advancements, “this is not the system that will get us to our goal faster,” Biden said.
