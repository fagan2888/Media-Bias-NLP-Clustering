This type of community service amounted to $402 million \u2014 about one-tenth of the total community benefit.\n\nRoughly $2.5 billion, the association said, was due to hospitals absorbing the costs of serving patients covered by government Medicare and Medicaid programs, which reimburse at well below hospitals\u2019 requested rates. Critics question the inclusion of such \u201cunderfunding\u201d as a community benefit, because hospitals balance out such losses by charging privately insured patients more.\n\nMassa agreed that some of that cost is passed along, but he said it is still an important number to report \u2014 especially to lawmakers who help set payment rates in Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have many other areas of economic endeavor where your large payers \u2026 pay you less than the cost of delivering the care,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be sustainable if there wasn\u2019t a cost shift, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\nMassa said he is concerned about the rise in bad debt. Writing off the cost of a needy patient as upfront charity is more efficient and less stressful than trying to collect from someone who\u2019s broke and can\u2019t pay insurance deductibles.\n\n\u201cMany of our members are looking at [new] charity care policies that don\u2019t necessarily have being uninsured as the trigger,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act also challenged hospitals to assess the needs of their communities and to prioritize them. The Rice hospital\u2019s project is an example. After conducting health assessments, it found Somali and other women in Willmar were out of shape and realized they didn\u2019t have a nearby place to exercise where they felt comfortable. The solution was a women-only fitness class that taught participants calisthenics and soccer.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "An increase in Minnesotans with health insurance hasn&rsquo;t decreased the uncompensated care provided by the state&rsquo;s hospitals, but it has caused a shift from outright charity care to bad debt from insured patients who couldn&rsquo;t afford their medical bills.", "title": "Minnesota hospitals report more bad debts, community benefits", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-hospitals-report-more-bad-debts-community-benefits/367757531/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "An increase in Minnesotans with health insurance hasn&rsquo;t decreased the uncompensated care provided by the state&rsquo;s hospitals, but it has caused a shift from outright charity care to bad debt from insured patients who couldn&rsquo;t afford their medical bills.", "title": "Minnesota hospitals report more bad debts, community benefits", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-hospitals-report-more-bad-debts-community-benefits/367757531/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "An increase in Minnesotans with health insurance hasn&rsquo;t decreased the uncompensated care provided by the state&rsquo;s hospitals, but it has caused a shift from outright charity care to bad debt from insured patients who couldn&rsquo;t afford their medical bills."}, "article_summary": "This type of community service amounted to $402 million \u2014 about one-tenth of the total community benefit.\n\u201cMany of our members are looking at [new] charity care policies that don\u2019t necessarily have being uninsured as the trigger,\u201d he said.\nThe total amount of uncompensated care by hospitals increased from $573 million in 2013 to $589 million in 2014, despite a 26 percent drop in charity care for the uninsured.\nCritics question the inclusion of such \u201cunderfunding\u201d as a community benefit, because hospitals balance out such losses by charging privately insured patients more.\nThe total community benefit was $4.3 billion in 2014, the first year in which a mandate under the Affordable Care Act required Americans to have health insurance."}
