BALTIMORE – Registration for Round 1 2017 opens Aug. 25, and the bid window opens Oct. 15, CMS announced yesterday.

“CMS is achieving additional savings as part of the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of the competitive bidding program,” stated CMS Deputy Administrator Sean Cavanaugh in a press release. “Data used to monitor the effectiveness of the overall competitive bidding program show that implementation is going smoothly, with few inquiries or complaints and no adverse changes to beneficiary health outcomes.”

Due to lower payments and decreased utilization, the Round 1 recompete has saved Medicare more than $580 million over three years (January 2011-December 2013), according to CMS. Round 2, which spanned 91 cities, and the national mail-order program have saved Medicare $2 billion in the first year, the agency says.
