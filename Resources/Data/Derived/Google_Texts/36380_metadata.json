Terry McAuliffe had appointed Jane Marum Roush, a former Circuit Court judge in Fairfax County, to the state Supreme Court last month. (Nikki Fox/Associated Press)\n\nA bitter partisan battle between Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) and the GOP-controlled legislature over an appointment to the state Supreme Court ground discourse to a halt Monday in a capital city long known for its political decorum.\n\nOn the surface, the battle was over who would fill a vacancy on the state\u2019s highest court: Justice Jane Marum Roush, a former Circuit Court judge from the Washington suburbs whom McAuliffe had appointed to the job last month, or Court of Appeals Judge Rossie D. Alston Jr., the GOP\u2019s preferred choice.\n\nBut in reality, the dispute was about power \u2014 and reflected the kind of partisan maneuvering that Virginia politicians have regularly promised to keep on the other side of the Potomac River.\n\n\u201cIf we do this, all the cups in the cupboard are broken,\u201d said Sen. A. Donald McEachin (D-Henrico). \u201cThere are no more customs, usages or practices of the Senate that are worth a hoot.\u201d\n\nRepublicans came to town determined to oust Roush \u2014 a rare and brazen move against a sitting judge that most of them admitted had little to do with her qualifications.\n\nThey said they were angry that McAuliffe hadn\u2019t consulted them about the selection. The governor accused Republicans of targeting a woman. They retorted that he was standing in the way of the appointment of an African American man.\n\nThe episode highlights how poisoned relations have become between Republican leaders and the deal-making Democrat who took office less than two years ago confident that he could woo them.\n\nA polarizing figure when he was a chief fundraiser for Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton, McAuliffe ran for office promising to reach out to Republicans. He alienated GOP leaders with a push in his first year to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, but after losing that battle, he shifted his focus to economic development and won some bipartisan praise.\n\nNow, the animosity seems as fierce as ever.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment Jr. (R-James City) called the fight over Roush a \u201cvery partisan issue that has resulted in circling of the wagons around the chief protagonist.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe governor never ever called me before a decision was made,\u201d Norment said, adding he wasn\u2019t offended, because \u201cmy ego is not that big.\u201d But, he said, it was \u201cpolitically foolish\u201d for McAuliffe not to get GOP buy-in ahead of time. \u201cAs a matter of fact, we all learned about it in the newspaper.\u201d\n\nDemocrats shot back at Republican motives and tactics, noting that Roush was not even given the courtesy of an interview, as Alston was Monday.\n\nSen. Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax), the Senate minority leader, said that \u201cyou can argue\u201d that McAuliffe could have done more \u2014 but that still doesn\u2019t justify removing Roush from the court.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason to take Judge Roush off the Supreme Court,\u201d Saslaw said. \u201cWe\u2019re heading down a path that, believe you me, we don\u2019t want to take.\u201d\n\nSen. Janet D. Howell (D-Fairfax) added: \u201cTheir objections came at the last minute and on the fly. They had no process. They did no interviews. They posted no advertisements. They didn\u2019t involve the public. They didn\u2019t request input from all members of the General Assembly. It isn\u2019t even clear if they considered all of their own caucus. And just today, the majority party refused to interview a sitting justice for her own position.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the GOP plan was foiled by one vote \u2014 in part because a lone Republican, disgusted by the discourse, refused to go along with his party\u2019s machinations.\n\n\u201cI doubt if either one of those people want to serve now,\u201d said Sen. John C. Watkins (R-Pow\u00adhatan), who is retiring at the end of the year in part, he has said, because he is tired of the partisan rancor that has infected Richmond. \u201cI have my doubts. And I couldn\u2019t blame them. They\u2019re very accomplished individuals, and they could probably be doing something that would earn them a lot more money and leave them a lot more time at home than serving on the Supreme Court of Virginia.\u201d\n\nWith the day\u2019s events came a reprieve for Roush \u2014 until the regular session gets underway early next year. Lawmakers can still choose to unseat her then, but they may find it more politically difficult to do after she\u2019s served five additional months on the bench.\n\nIn Virginia, judicial appointments are not subject to gubernatorial approval \u2014 except temporary appointments when lawmakers are in recess.\n\nMcAuliffe appointed Roush on an interim basis, meaning that her term expires 30 days after lawmakers convene unless they elect her to a full 12 years. As a result, Roush\u2019s appointment will expire 30 days from Monday \u2014 but McAuliffe said late in the day that he he will appoint her to a second interim appointment on Sept 16.\n\nLeading up to Monday, there had been talk that Republicans were planning to keep the special session going all the way until January \u2014 rather than adjourning \u2014 in order to prevent McAuliffe from giving Roush another recess appointment.\n\nSenate Democrats appeared to have cut off that maneuver with one of their own, abruptly bringing up \u2014 and passing, with the help of Watkins \u2014 a vote to adjourn.\n\nThe move represented a temporary coup for Democrats, but Republicans questioned its constitutionality, as well as whether McAuliffe can legally appoint Roush to a second interim appointment.\n\n\u201cThe House of Delegates remains in session,\u201d Norment, House Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford) and other Republicans said in a joint statement.\n\nThe events underscored McAuliffe\u2019s own missteps, including not only his failure to consult with top Republicans about Roush but also his decision to call the special session in the first place \u2014 which gave the GOP its opening to go after the appointment.\n\nMcAuliffe called the session to redraw the state\u2019s congressional districts, as ordered by a federal court to be completed by Sept. 1. The current districts were deemed unconstitutionally gerrymandered to pack African American voters into a single district, thus weakening their political influence elsewhere.\n\nDemocrats have said Republicans had no intention of producing a new map \u2014 in part because they anticipated that McAuliffe would veto anything they proposed.\n\nNow McAuliffe will write directly to the court to inform a panel of federal judges that Virginia\u2019s congressional elections map is in their hands.\n\nLess clear is who will benefit politically under a new map drawn by the judiciary because the General Assembly declined to act.\n\n\u201cI thought the Republicans looked small and ineffective, they couldn\u2019t get their justice through. They did nothing on redistricting. They did nothing to help Virginia today,\u201d McAuliffe told reporters, getting in the final word of the day.\n\nMcAuliffe said he called Roush to tell her that her job is safe for now.\n\n\u201cShe has been steady from the start of this,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has been a pawn in a partisan political game that she should never have been in. She\u2019s a pretty serious jurist and she said, \u2018I\u2019m going back to work.\u2019 \u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "vapolitics, Virginia, state house, legislature, Supreme Court", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Gov.
