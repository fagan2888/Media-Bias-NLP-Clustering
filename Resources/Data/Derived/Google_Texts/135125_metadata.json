Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) said Saturday that the \u201clousy\u201d deal the Democratic-led Senate brokered to end the government shutdown amounts to \u201cselling the American people down the river.\u201d\n\nCruz was equally unhappy with his fellow Senate Republicans, whom he said \u201cdeclined to unify and declined to support House Republicans.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t win a fight when your own team is firing cannons at the people who are standing up and leading, which are the House Republicans,\u201d Cruz said during a convention in Austin of the Texas Medical Association. \u201cThat\u2019s what happened, and that\u2019s what led directly to this lousy deal.\u201d\n\nCruz added that he\u2019s hopeful his colleagues won\u2019t repeat that if there\u2019s another political impasse: \u201cI am hopeful that in the future the Senate will listen.\u201d\n\nCruz in late September staged a 21-plus hour filibuster on the Senate floor, helping spark a budget fight in the Republican-led House that partially shuttered the government in an attempt to delay funding for Obamacare.\n\nThe deal that was eventually struck this week sets up the potential for another budget showdown in January. Senate GOP leaders, however, have suggested that there won\u2019t be a repeat of the shutdown or a potential default crisis like in recent weeks.\n\nAddressing reporters after his speech, Cruz wouldn\u2019t rule out another fight.\n\n\u201cThere will be plenty of time to consider the particular practical or strategic decisions,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked if he was worried about retaliation from more-senior Republican leaders in the Senate, Cruz said, \u201cI try very hard not to worry about the politics and the internal back-and-forth in Washington.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy focus is on doing my job,\u201d he said.\n\nSaturday\u2019s crowd was mostly sympathetic, with many convention attendees giving Cruz a standing ovation at the end of his speech. Some stayed seated, though.\n\n\u201cObamacare isn\u2019t working, and not only is it not working, it\u2019s not working badly,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nHe said because the nation\u2019s new health care law has price limits that restrict discrepancies between what young Americans buying insurance pay and what older customers pay, it was a \u201cmassive wealth transfer\u201d from healthy young people \u201cwho are struggling, just starting their career, to everybody else.\u201d\n\nCruz said the rollout of online health care exchanges where customers can buy insurance coverage has been full of glitches \u2014 but he said that those would be resolved, while fundamental flaws in the law will endure.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll get the technical things worked out,\u201d he said. \u201cEventually they\u2019ll hire a programmer who can find his rear end with both hands.\u201d\n\nMany political observers now see Cruz as Texas\u2019 most popular Republican. His approval ratings across the country may be slipping a bit, however.\n\nNational polls have shown that while Americans in general don\u2019t love the health care law, they oppose defunding it \u2014 especially if it means shutting down the government. Many of Cruz\u2019s Senate colleagues, meanwhile, have bemoaned the shutdown for tarnishing the GOP\u2019s image nationally.\n\nCruz also took questions from the audience and was asked if ideology driving Washington could outweigh political pragmatism.\n\n\u201cThe arguments I have laid out today have not been ideological,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThese were the essence of practical.\u201d\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Story by the Associated Press; curated by Dave Urbanski  AUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 U.S. Sen.
