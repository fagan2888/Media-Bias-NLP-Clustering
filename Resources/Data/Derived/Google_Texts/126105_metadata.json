For the latest installment of our \u201cBig Think\u201d series, we meet Rick Doblin. He heads a nonprofit that sponsors research into the use of LSD and MDMA to treat mental illness. His Big Think?\n\n\u201cThere should be thousands of psychedelic psychotherapy clinics all over the world.\u201d\n\nIn the future, Doblin believes anybody with anxiety, depression, marital problems or a fear of snakes could be treated with a drug trip\n\nDoblin came of age in the early \u201970s, right when President Richard Nixon declared America\u2019s war on drugs.\n\n\u201cMarijuana! The burning weed with its roots in hell,\u201d says the ominous voiceover in the much-parodied 1930s film, \u201cReefer Madness.\u201d \u201cSmoking the soul-destroying reefer, they find a moment\u2019s pleasure. But at a terrible price: Divorcery! Violence! Murder! Suicide! And the ultimate end of the marijuana addict \u2014 hopeless insanity.\u201d\n\nDoblin remembers watching the film as a joke when he was a teenager. But some of the same messages meant to scare young people away from pot in the \u201930s were recycled in the \u201970s to create fear around psychedelics.\n\n\u201cIn high school I remember thinking drugs like LSD were terribly dangerous and that they would make you crazy,\u201d Doblin says. \u201cThe education that I got was that if you took LSD more than a few times, you were going to be certifiably insane.\u201d\n\nWhen Doblin got to college, he tried LSD. A lot of it. And it changed his life. He dropped out of school.\n\n\u201cI was way out of balance, overdeveloped intellectually, underdeveloped emotionally and spiritually,\u201d he says.\n\nHe embarked on a crusade to make psychedelics legal in the U.S., and in the mid-1980s started a nonprofit called the Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), now based in Santa Cruz, to further research into the benefits of psychedelics.\n\n\u201cWhen I started feeling like this was a tool that could bring me into balance, I realized this was a tool that could bring society back into balance,\u201d he says.\n\nToday, his group has permission from the FDA to research new treatments for mental disorders using LSD, a hallucinogenic, and MDMA, commonly known as Ecstacy, or E, which induces feelings of euphoria and empathy.\n\nDoblin\u2019s group is currently studying the use of MDMA to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among war veterans and social anxiety in autistic adults. It\u2019s also studying how LSD can help ease the dying process for the terminally ill.\n\nThe treatment protocol is highly structured and, Doblin believes, replicable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a male-female co-therapist team. People are receiving MDMA around 10 in the morning. It goes till 6 at night or so,\u201d he says. \u201cThen people are required to spend the night in the treatment center.\u201d\n\nThe next day, the patient and therapist talk for hours about the drug trip. They check in every day over the phone for the next month. Doblin says this post-trip therapy is key.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t do that integrative work, then \u2014 like dreams you don\u2019t pay attention to \u2014 they fade away and you don\u2019t benefit from really learning and growing from them,\u201d he says.\n\nDoblin says one that day there will be a network of these psychedelic psychotherapy clinics around the world. And LSD and MDMA will be used to treat a range of anxieties and phobias, even a fear of spiders or fear of flying. Eventually, he says people with no formal diagnosis will be able to try them.\n\n\u201cI believe that these clinics will eventually expand to treat people that have just an interest in personal growth or spiritual experiences or couples therapies,\u201d he says. \u201cCouples therapy is one of the best uses for MDMA.\u201d\n\nPlenty of other cultures use psychedelics to promote personal growth. People in Brazil and Peru use ayuhuasca, a plant-based psychedelic brew, for spiritual quests and healing rituals. Native Americans use peyote in religious ceremonies. Doblin says kids and adolescents are sometimes involved. He remembers going to a Navajo wedding where a 9-year-old boy participated.\n\n\u201cHe stayed up all night. They gave him small doses of peyote,\u201d he says. \u201cThese are cultures that have successfully integrated psychedelics. They are good examples of what we can do in a Western culture. They don\u2019t have young people going off and abusing peyote and abusing ayuhuasca.\u201d\n\n\u2018We need honest drug education, not crude propaganda that kids these days can easily see through.\u2019\n\nThat is precisely what critics of Doblin\u2019s work say would happen if he succeeds in opening a network of psychedelic clinics. That would only encourage kids to do drugs and tune out of society, critics say.\n\nBut Doblin disagrees. He says the prohibition mentality of today\u2019s anti-drug campaigns doesn\u2019t work. He calls public service announcements implying teenagers will end up in the hospital from half a hit of Ecstasy (MDMA), or decline into utter mental instability after trying LSD, exaggerated and dishonest.\n\n\u201cThese are ridiculous attempts at creating fear. They exaggerate the negative and deny the positive,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need honest drug education, not crude propaganda that kids these days can easily see through.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that Doblin thinks it should be a free-for-all. He says the way kids usually take drugs is dangerous. Drugs are often impure and people are taking them in unsupportive environments, like dance clubs, surrounded by other people who are high.\n\n\u201cIf they think they\u2019re doing it only for fun and only for recreational purposes, and something serious comes up, then they\u2019re unprepared for it,\u201d Doblin says.\n\nDoblin has three kids, ages 20, 19, and 17. Watching them go through extensive driver\u2019s education training has inspired another big idea.\n\n\u201cYou have to take a course, you have to pass a test. They have to do 10 hours of driving with their parents in the car, all different things,\u201d he says. \u201cSo the question is, should there be some similar model like that for young people, for anybody who wants to have legal access to psychedelics.\u201d\n\nHe says his clinics will be the ideal place where people can get training in how to take psychedelics responsibly.\n\n\u201cI would feel more comfortable if people had their first psychedelic experience under supervision, and then they could get a license and buy it and do it on their own,\u201d he says.\n\nUnder Doblin\u2019s clinical protocol, a three-month course of psychedelic-assisted therapy would include three drug trips and cost about $10,000. He says by the time the therapy gets legalized \u2014 2021 is the goal \u2014 he believes he will have convinced health insurance companies to pay for it.\n\n\u201cPart of the clinical trials is looking not just at the influence of MDMA on PTSD, but we also want to look at health care utilization,\u201d he says. People with PTSD are shown to have more heart attacks and other costly physical health conditions. Doblin believes those costs could be alleviated by effective psychotherapy. And that logic could spill over into off-label uses of the drugs as well.\n\n\u201cA very good economic case can be made that psychedelic-assisted therapy for people looking for personal growth or spiritual experiences, that it\u2019s a part of preventive medicine,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd insurance companies may start covering that as well.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Santa Cruz researcher is investigating use of MDMA and LSD to treat a wide range of conditions.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Rick Doblin on Making Psychedelics Legal and Mainstream\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/news\\/2015\\/11\\/30\\/big-think-rick-doblin-on-making-psychedelics-legal-and-mainstream\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-11-30 13:18:22\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-03-24 14:09:13\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":10775560,\"author_id\":\"3205\",\"author_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"author_display_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"tags\":[\"LSD\",\"MDMA\",\"mental health\",\"ptsd\"],\"categories\":[\"Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/news\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/10\\/2015\\/11\\/RickDoblin.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "KQED News", "description": "The Santa Cruz researcher is investigating use of MDMA and LSD to treat a wide range of conditions.", "title": "Rick Doblin on Making Psychedelics Legal and Mainstream", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2015/11/30/big-think-rick-doblin-on-making-psychedelics-legal-and-mainstream/", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/ww2.kqed.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2015/11/RickDoblin.jpg?fit=640%2C352", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqednews", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "lsd,mdma,mental health,ptsd", "google-site-verification": "Oam-TnlJjUP-cg8UEyR3-KcLp8_-WTy6_dBaSws1ADA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIn high school I remember thinking drugs like LSD were terribly dangerous and that they would make you crazy,\u201d Doblin says.\nDoblin says one that day there will be a network of these psychedelic psychotherapy clinics around the world.\nFor the latest installment of our \u201cBig Think\u201d series, we meet Rick Doblin.\nHe heads a nonprofit that sponsors research into the use of LSD and MDMA to treat mental illness.\n\u201cCouples therapy is one of the best uses for MDMA.\u201dPlenty of other cultures use psychedelics to promote personal growth."}
