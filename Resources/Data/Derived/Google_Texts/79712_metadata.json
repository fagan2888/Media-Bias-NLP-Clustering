In a letter to Treasury Secretary, Sanders said he was imploring the Obama administration to act because Republicans have made it clear they won\u2019t.\n\nThe provisions that Sanders called out include the so-called \u201ccheck the box\u201d rules that essentially allow multinational corporations to shield profits from being taxed by any government.\n\nSanders also called on Obama to end the tax break for carried interest that allows hedge fund managers to largely pay the lower capital gains tax rate, and to do more to stop the offshore tax deals known as inversions.\n\n\u201cOur nation has never, in the past five decades, balanced a budget with revenue levels as low as they are projected to be,\u201d Sanders, the ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee, wrote to Lew on Friday.\n\n\u201cThis list is not intended to be exhaustive but rather to illustrate that if Congress fails to act, the administration can act to resolve some of the problems with our tax code,\u201d the Vermont senator added.\n\nSanders\u2019s letter comes as Congress remains locked in a battle over funding the Homeland Security Department, after passing a one-week stopgap measure on Friday. Conservative lawmakers have sought to use a Homeland Security funding measure to impede Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration.\n\nBut Sanders wants the administration to make more use of executive action. He told Lew on Monday that three of the provisions on his list \u2013 the check the box rules, rules that allow companies to make tax-free loans from offshore subsidiaries and the use of real estate investment trusts to avoid corporate taxes \u2013 were put into place by regulation, and can be ended that way.\n\nSanders added that he believes the administration can deal with the other three \u2013 the carried interest rule, so-called \u201cearnings stripping\u201d rules that make inversions more attractive and valuation discount rules that lower estate tax obligations \u2013 under Treasury\u2019s power to regulate U.S. tax laws.\n\nLew has said that the administration is examining what other steps it can take on inversions, but that a broader overhaul of the tax code is the only way to truly fix the problem.\n\nRepublicans have said they\u2019re willing to consider rolling back tax breaks like those mentioned by Sanders, but only as part of tax reform.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Sen.
