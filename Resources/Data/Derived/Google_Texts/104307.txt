WILMINGTON, NC (WWAY) — Wilmington fire crews are clearing up after an apartment fire displaced two residents on Maides Avenue.

Firefighters said there have been no injuries reported. The American Red Cross will be helping them with housing.

The fire started in Michael Rogers’ home that he just moved to in September. He lost all his belongings, including medication he needs to take everyday.

“It could have been worse, it could have been all four houses gone if any of my great neighbors didn’t see that,” Rogers said. “We look out for each other.”

Crews from the Wilmington Fire Marshal’s Office ruled the fire accidental.
