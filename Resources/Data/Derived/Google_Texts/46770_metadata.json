The federal measure requires healthcare providers to provide preventative healthcare services free of charge, including anesthesia for colonoscopies, Gannett's Denise Nickerson reports.\n\n\u201cPreventative screening procedures are critical to improving the health of New Yorkers, and today\u2019s agreement will help ensure that more people are getting important life-saving care,\u201d Schneiderman said in a statement obtained by Gannett's Albany Bureau.\n\nSchneiderman said that because every colonoscopy requires the use of anesthesia, they should be covered under the member\u2019s plan, except in the event that the member decides for anesthesia to be provided by an out-of-network provider.\n\nSchneiderman added that while in the past Emblem\u2019s plans acknowledged this, certain plans still failed to remove anesthesia service fees.\n\nUnder the settlement, Emblem agreed to cover in full, all claims for anesthesiology services. As a result, Emblem has agreed to send refund checks to members of certain Emblem plan holders who have paid copayments, coinsurance, or deductibles for anesthesiology services connected with colonoscopy exams.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Manhattan-based company, which also has offices in Albany, Buffalo and Syracuse. Its website said it has about 3.4 million customers.\n\nSchneiderman\u2019s office received several complaints from members, regarding the fees that they were charged from Emblem, including one member who received a bill from an anesthesiologist for $1,320 for a preventive colonoscopy procedure. Since the member\u2019s anesthesiologist did not participate with Emblem\u2019s network provider, the member was responsible for paying a $396 coinsurance to Emblem.\n\nConsumers who believe they may have been treated unfairly by a health care provider can call the Attorney General\u2019s Health Care Helpline at 800-428-9071.\n\nJoseph Spector Albany bureau chief: Joseph Spector is Gannett's Albany Bureau chief and has covered New York politics and government since 2002.
