That decision ensures that the law will remain permanently blocked, and women in the state will continue being able to access abortion care until the point of viability as defined under Roe v. Wade, around 24 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n\u201cThis ensures that no Arizona women\u2019s lives or health are harmed by this callous and unconstitutional law,\u201d Nancy Northrup, the president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement. Northrup\u2019s organization partnered with the ACLU to file suit against Arizona\u2019s abortion ban in 2012.\n\nThese type of later abortion restrictions have become somewhat of a flashpoint in the debate over reproductive rights. Nine states have enacted laws banning abortion procedures after 20 weeks, typically based on the junk science that fetuses can experience pain after that point. The House passed a national 20-week ban over the summer, and a companion measure was introduced in the Senate in November. Arizona\u2019s law, however, is even more stringent than many of the other 20-week bans that have passed at a state level. It defines gestation in a different way than the other bans, cutting off abortion access two weeks earlier \u2014 as much as a full month before Roe v. Wade\u2018s deadline. Doctors violating the law could have been sent to jail.\n\nThe anti-choice community understands that 20-week bans violate Roe v. Wade, and is ultimately hoping to provoke a Supreme Court challenge that ends up narrowing the window during which women may access abortion services. So far, though, the nation\u2019s highest court has been reluctant to weigh in on the issue. The justices didn\u2019t explain their reasoning for deciding not to take up the case in Arizona \u2014 but they likely simply aren\u2019t interested in overruling the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal\u2019s earlier decision.\n\nWomen\u2019s health advocates celebrated the news, but warned that attacks on reproductive rights are still advancing in other states across the country. Later this week, the Supreme Court will take up oral arguments in another abortion-related case. The justices appear to be poised to strike down buffer zones around abortion clinics, which would give anti-abortion harassers unlimited access to the patients and staff trying to enter and exit those clinics. A challenge to Obamacare\u2019s contraception mandate also threatens to limit access to affordable birth control for women whose bosses object to covering it.\n\n\u201cToday the Court did the right thing, but women\u2019s health is still on the docket \u2014 not only at the Supreme Court, but in active cases all across the country,\u201d Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood, noted in a statement.\n\n\u201cWomen should not be forced to run to court, year after year, in state after state, to protect their constitutional rights and access to critical health care,\u201d the Center for Reproductive Right\u2019s Northrup added. \u201cOur fundamental rights are not up for debate and cannot be legislated away by politicians who are hell bent on restricting access to the full range of reproductive health care.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The nation's highest court dealt Arizona's abortion ban a final blow, ensuring it will remain permanently blocked.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The nation's highest court dealt Arizona's abortion ban a final blow, ensuring it will remain permanently blocked.", "title": "Supreme Court Prevents Arizona From Enforcing Its 20-Week Abortion Ban", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/01/13/3153241/supreme-court-arizona-abortion-ban/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/abortion-safe-and-legal.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The nation's highest court dealt Arizona's abortion ban a final blow, ensuring it will remain permanently blocked.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/abortion-safe-and-legal-321x214.jpg", "title": "Supreme Court Prevents Arizona From Enforcing Its 20-Week Abortion Ban", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/abortion-safe-and-legal.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/abortion-safe-and-legal.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-13T10:16:40+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af56914bd0286fe5062\"", "article_summary": "Health Supreme Court Prevents Arizona From Enforcing Its 20-Week Abortion Ban CREDIT: Feminist CampusOn Monday, the Supreme Court declined to review a lower court\u2019s decision to block a 20-week abortion ban from taking effect in Arizona.\nLater this week, the Supreme Court will take up oral arguments in another abortion-related case.\nThese type of later abortion restrictions have become somewhat of a flashpoint in the debate over reproductive rights.\nThe anti-choice community understands that 20-week bans violate Roe v.
