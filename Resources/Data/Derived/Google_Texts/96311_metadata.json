Sam Smith, R-Jefferson County, saying he\u2019s not coming back to the General Assembly next year, who will be Pennsylvania\u2019s next Speaker of the House?\n\nTo answer that, you have to answer these questions first.\n\nWhat party is going to be in the majority after the 2014 elections?\n\nThe speaker is elected by a majority of the whole House, which is another way of saying it is an election that the majority party usually controls.\n\nAll 203 House seats are up for election in 2014.\n\nWith a 111-92 edge in the House at this writing, it seems hard to believe that the House Republicans will lose their grip on power this year \u2014 whether or not Gov. Tom Corbett is re-elected.\n\nThis is politics, so we\u2019ll never say never.\n\nSo much depends on the quality of the individual candidates both parties have recruited to run, the state of the economy as the year goes on, even whether the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is perceived to be working. Or not.\n\nBut for the sake of argument today, and with all due respect to the Democratic Party, let\u2019s assume the GOP retains the House.\n\nIf the Republicans win the next question is \u2026 What does Mike Turzai want?\n\nTurzai, a Republican attorney from the Pittsburgh suburbs, is House majority leader right now, and that\u2019s the position from which speakers are usually born. It also means that he\u2019s won his caucus\u2019s backing for this kind of election before.\n\nBut there were differing views Tuesday on how badly Turzai, 54, wants the speaker\u2019s job.\n\nSome believe he wants to continue driving the Legislature\u2019s policy agenda as only the majority leader can. Turzai, to these people, is a true conservative advocate who would have a hard time staying on the sidelines on the big issue of the day.\n\nOthers said they believe he would naturally be interested in the serving in the highest office in the state House. As one source put it: \u201cI can\u2019t see him allowing someone to go above him.\u201d\n\nAnd one person suggested this scenario. Turzai stays in place to work his issues for one more term, maybe two, and seeks to promote his caucus chairman, Rep. Sandra Major, R-Susquehanna County, into the speaker\u2019s role.\n\nRepublicans make history with the first female speaker, Turzai has an ally and not a rival in the top spot, and the promise of moving into the office down the road.\n\nBut, that\u2019s all future talk.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a chess match rite now, and nobody really knows what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said John O\u2019Connell, a lobbyist who used to work for the House GOP. \u201cBut it all goes back to, Mike has to make the first move.\u201d\n\nTurzai declined requests for comment on his future Tuesday, choosing instead only to praise Smith for his service.\n\nIf Turzai wants it, could he win it?\n\nThe consensus at the Capitol on Tuesday is, probably.\n\nTurzai has built a strong base of supporters in his home Southwestern counties and linked them to the more conservative members in the northern tier and south central counties that make up the reliably Republican Pennsylvania \"T.\"\n\nHe\u2019s proven himself adept at winning the support of newly elected members \u2014 who will vote on the caucus leadership team in November \u2014 with timely campaign contributions and other help.\n\nTurzai does have less support with GOP members from the Philadelphia suburbs, who tend to be more moderate and sensitive to the concerns of organized labor, to name one special interest.\n\nTurzai could well draw a challenger from the GOP\u2019s more moderate ranks, several sources said Tuesday. But at this early point, the view from here is it\u2019s that dissenter who has the uphill road.\n\nAnd we don\u2019t think for one minute that the Republicans, whatever their fissures, would let anyone win the speakership who didn\u2019t command the allegiance of a majority of the majority.\n\nIn other words, dissenting Republicans plus House Democrats aren\u2019t likely to win.\n\n\u201cI honestly feel we\u2019ll come together with a leadership team like we always do,\u201d said Rep. Kate Harper, R-Montgomery County, and one of the more moderate members of the Republican caucus. \u201cWe\u2019re not Congress. And we\u2019re not Democrats.\u201d\n\nWho else gets to join the new leadership team?\n\nThere will be at least one person joining the inner-most power circles of state government power with Smith\u2019s impending retirement. That much we know, because at the least the House will need a new Speaker or majority leader.\n\nThe names we heard most on Tuesday, in an unscientific survey, included several current members of the House Republican leadership team, like (in alphabetical order):\n\nRep. Bill Adolph, R-Delaware.\n\nThe current House Appropriations chairman has 26 years' seniority and gives members from the southeast a comfortable face in leadership.\n\nBut he\u2019s not a favorite of some of the more conservative members in the caucus, which led some observers to suggest Tuesday that Adolph\u2019s smartest play may be staying right where he is.\n\nSome also wondered if he wants the work that comes with the majority leader\u2019s post which, like its counterpart office in the state Senate, is probably one of the two most taxing jobs in the General Assembly.\n\nRep. David Reed, R-Indiana.\n\nCurrently chairman of the House Majority Policy Committee, Reed has performed well in just about every caucus task he\u2019s received to date, and has maintained good relations with all members.\n\nBut Reed, 35, would have to leapfrog over a lot of fellow leaders to get a top spot now.\n\nAnother potential liability could be geography. If Turzai holds one of the top spots, it\u2019s not really balancing the leadership ticket for the GOP to give the other one to someone from two counties over.\n\nRep. Mike Vereb, R-Montgomery County.\n\nVereb has quickly moved into the caucus secretary role, and probably wants to keep climbing. Some observers said Vereb, still only in his fourth term, may need more seasoning before getting a top role.\n\nAdolph and Reed both said they weren\u2019t worrying about future roles now, asserting the priorities for 2014 are passing a good budget and making sure Republicans stay in the majority.\n\nVereb did not respond to a message from PennLive.\n\nA final note.\n\nIf several people do move up the ladder, opportunities will open for junior leadership posts, too.\n\nIn the mix for consideration there, again alphabetically, are several midstaters, including Reps. Bryan Cutler, R-Quarryville, Glen Grell, R-Hampden Township, and Ron Marsico, R-Lower Paxton Township.\n\nGrell, chairman of the 25-member South Central Caucus, declined comment on his own interest in a leadership spot Tuesday.\n\nBut he did say that the regional group \u2014 represented solely by Majority Whip Stan Saylor, R-Red Lion, now \u2014 does feel it has a legitimate claim to a second leadership spot within the caucus.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@mobile','@papolitics','@topstories','pennsylvania','pennsylvania legislature','sam smith'", "title": "Who's Pa.'s next House speaker?
