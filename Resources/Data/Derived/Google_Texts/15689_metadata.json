With those ends in mind, he said, he\u2019s focusing on strengthening and expanding relationships with health plans and physician partners and forging a deeper collaboration internally between North Memorial\u2019s medical and financial units.\n\n\u201cA key goal is integrating medical management with financial management to control costs without compromising quality and really driving an understanding of the financial metrics throughout the organization,\u201d he said.\n\nPressure to reduce health care costs is coming from several sources, he said, including changing reimbursement rates under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), needs of the senior population and the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases.\n\nHe was CFO of UnitedHealth Group\u2019s Evercare and Inspiris businesses, which provide care for chronically ill patients and hospice care. \u201cWe directly employed health care providers to help manage care and ensure those positive outcomes, and we were really successful at eliminating unnecessary costs and ensuring high quality,\u201d he said. Before moving into health care, he worked in corporate at Best Buy and Supervalu. He has an MBA from the University of Minnesota\u2019s Carlson School of Management.\n\nQ: How is North Memorial responding to the ACA?\n\nA: North Memorial Health Care is focusing a great deal of effort on building out its network of primary care physicians, through expansion of owned clinics or greater collaboration with affiliated physicians. Reform also presents the organization with unique opportunities to partner with local health plans to offer exclusive membership opportunities in low-cost health plans if those participants are committed to receiving their care exclusively from North Memorial or affiliated providers.\n\nQ: Has your retail experience influenced your health care work?\n\nA: When you think about a primary care network providing convenient access to people in the communities we serve, there\u2019s a very similar retail flavor to it. Whether you\u2019re operating a retail entity or a primary care clinic, it\u2019s all about the patient experience and trying to provide something that\u2019s meaningful for people coming into one of our facilities.\n\nQ: What appeals to you about the health care industry?\n\nA: What I most appreciate is at the end of every day, I leave my office knowing that the organization I work for made a profound impact on the lives of so many.\n\nTodd Nelson", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "A look at the people behind the numbers in area business:.", "title": "Movers & Shakers: Todd Ostendorf", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/movers-shakers-todd-ostendorf/238656011/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1Movers010614.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1Movers010614.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "A look at the people behind the numbers in area business:.", "title": "Movers & Shakers: Todd Ostendorf", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/movers-shakers-todd-ostendorf/238656011/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1Movers010614.JPG?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1Movers010614.JPG?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "A look at the people behind the numbers in area business:."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8aed\"", "article_summary": "Before moving into health care, he worked in corporate at Best Buy and Supervalu.\nQ: What appeals to you about the health care industry?\nA: North Memorial Health Care is focusing a great deal of effort on building out its network of primary care physicians, through expansion of owned clinics or greater collaboration with affiliated physicians.\nPressure to reduce health care costs is coming from several sources, he said, including changing reimbursement rates under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), needs of the senior population and the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases.\nQ: How is North Memorial responding to the ACA?"}
