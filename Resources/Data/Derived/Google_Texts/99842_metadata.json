Contact the program by calling the local Area Agency on Aging at 1-800-AGE-LINE (1-800-243-5463).\n\nFor more information, you can visit http://www.AlabamaAgeline.gov.\n\nYour BBB offers the following tips to help seniors avoid fraud:\n\nVerify that a salesperson is a licensed insurance agent. You can call Alabama\u2019s State Insurance Consumer Services at 334-241-4141.\\\n\nBe wary of door-to-door salespeople. Medicare does not have sales representatives, and agents cannot solicit Medicare plans at your home without an appointment.\n\nAvoid sales people who offer free lunches for listening to a sales presentation. Federal law prohibits offers of free meals in exchange for signing up for a plan or listening to a presentation on Medicare.\n\nDo not give personal information to an unlicensed agent. Salespeople are not allowed to ask for a Social Security, bank account or credit card number during marketing activities. When you do enroll, you may need to provide such information, but make sure the salesperson is legitimate by calling the numbers above.\n\nInsurance salespeople cannot ask for online payments. They must send a bill. Once you decide to buy a plan and have verified the agent is licensed, then you may give the agent personal information for enrollment and billing.\n\nMedicare has strict rules on forbidden sales practices. Also, remember that Medicare is not part of the federal health insurance marketplace (exchange) under the Affordable Care Act. The marketplace is not meant to serve Medicare recipients.\n\nIf you find the process confusing or need help, ask a relative or trusted friend to come with you when you are talking to a sales representative or searching for plans online.\n\nAs always, call the Better Business Bureau with any questions or concerns at (256) 850-0719.", "article_metadata": {"description": "BBB warns\u00a0consumers to beware of\u00a0individuals pitching\u00a0Medicare drug, supplement or Medicare Advantage plans during open enrollment.
