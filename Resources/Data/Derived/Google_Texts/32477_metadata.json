Appropriately enough, the lesson at hand requires us to ask an important question: How do we go about balancing the vertical density that makes any city feel urban with the scenic, spirit-reviving respites that make it feel, well, human?\n\nAt the heart of the issue is a vacant, weed-strewn lot that locals would like to see converted into a pocket park: one of those delightful miniature oases that urbanites always feel blessed to chance upon as we wend our way through the city\u2019s concrete canyons and glass-and-steel stalagmites. Melissa Stern has lived in a building directly across the street from the lot, on a quiet block of W. 20th St., since 1990. She would often make friendly small talk with workers from the New York City Department of Sanitation, which maintained an office next door to the lot for many years and whose employees used the quarter-acre space for parking. Back in 2005, one of these workers mentioned that his branch was awaiting a transfer out of Chelsea; if and when that move took place, he intimated, the parking lot next door would likely become the footprint for a new high-rise residential building. Curious, Stern began calling her local representatives, trying to get the 411 on the city\u2019s plans for the space. \u201cThey kept saying, \u2018We don\u2019t know anything about that,\u2019\u201d she told me in a recent interview.\n\nStern didn\u2019t give up, though, and continued to query them regularly\u2014to no avail\u2014for the next four years, right up to the day in 2009 that one of her sanitation worker friends announced that the department was moving to Queens \u2026 later that week. Furthermore, he told her, from what he had heard, the high-rise project was already something of a fait accompli. The tiny lot next door, as it was later reported, had been used as a bargaining chip during negotiations over a much bigger land deal between the city and developers. As a result, the city agreed to turn the now-vacant lot into a 75-unit residential building for middle-income New Yorkers.\n\nNow: You\u2019ll never hear me or any other sustainable cities advocate argue against increased urban density, especially when it comes to housing. And under most circumstances, in most other cities, the decision to put 75 apartments atop a relatively small parcel of land that was previously home to parked cars (and currently houses little more than gravel and beer cans) would be a no-brainer. But in a city already famous for its density, and in a part of town that consistently ranks near the very bottom in terms of public green space, a question arises: Which amenity confers the greater benefit to the greater number of New Yorkers? Are 75 units of new housing in a tight housing market appreciably \u201cbetter\u201d for New York City than 10,000 square feet of parkland in a neighborhood that is demonstrably starved for parkland and\u2014though it\u2019s home to 2,000 children\u2014hasn\u2019t seen a new playground built in 45 years?\n\nWere he alive today, John Stuart Mill would have relished the conundrum. The 19th-century British philosopher is widely regarded as the intellectual father of utilitarianism, the branch of pragmatic philosophy that asks which of our acts, private and public, represent the greatest good for society as a whole. The debate in Chelsea is pure utilitarian catnip: an irresistible riddle that asks us to weigh the social utility of two possible outcomes, and then asks us to choose between them based on which of them would provide the maximum \u201cgood.\u201d One outcome would prove to be of immense, immediate benefit\u2014but only to a couple of hundred people, at most. The other outcome would provide a more diffuse benefit, but would be experienced by many thousands of Chelsea residents, workers, and visitors.\n\nHere are the data points behind the dilemma. On the one hand, researchers at the University of Illinois have looked at more than a decade\u2019s worth of the science and concluded that as urban green space increases, physical and social ills decrease\u2014crime, domestic violence, even symptoms associated with attention deficit disorder. The American Planning Association, a consortium of city planners dedicated to pursuing urban smart-growth policies, released a list of two dozen case studies from cities all across America that illustrate just how important urban parks of all sizes are to community cohesion (including this community in New Orleans, where a vacant lot became a pocket-park garden whose produce, harvested by local children, goes to a non-profit cafe providing free meals to needy families).\n\nOn the other hand, of course, is the fact that housing for middle-income families in nice neighborhoods is hard to find. But here\u2019s where Mill might start to squirm a little as he began crunching those utilitarian numbers. As this February 2013 report from the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development, a New York-based group working to expand the pool of local affordable housing, makes discomfitingly clear, the whole notion of \u201cmiddle-income\u201d in many of Manhattan\u2019s more expensive neighborhoods (including Chelsea) is so skewed that households of any size\u2014including just one person\u2014who report an income of $190,000 still qualify for subsidized housing. (Just for example: among the 168 units in the Elliott-Chelsea, a 22-story building erected in 2012 only a few blocks northwest of the W. 20th St. lot, are 45 two-bedroom units earmarked for these very middle-income earners. The subsidized rent for these apartments begins at $3,421 a month: a figure that will probably strike many people who consider themselves middle-income as not exactly \u201caffordable.\u201d)", "article_metadata": {"description": "In cities like New York, pocket parks may be even harder to come by than affordable housing", "title": "Are urban green spaces doomed?", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In cities like New York, pocket parks may be even harder to come by than affordable housing", "title": "Are urban green spaces doomed?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/11/02/open_manhattan_space_highlights_citys_lack_of_options_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/newyork-shutterstock-600.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In cities like New York, pocket parks may be even harder to come by than affordable housing", "title": "Are urban green spaces doomed?", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/newyork-shutterstock-600.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jeff Turrentine", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, affordable housing, Chelsea, human, neighborhood, New York City, OnEarth.org, Poverty, public park", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9055\"", "article_summary": "Topics: affordable housing, Chelsea, human, neighborhood, New York City, OnEarth.org, Poverty, public park, Sustainability News, Social News, Business News, Life NewsThis article originally appeared on OnEarth.org.\nNow: You\u2019ll never hear me or any other sustainable cities advocate argue against increased urban density, especially when it comes to housing.\nAs a result, the city agreed to turn the now-vacant lot into a 75-unit residential building for middle-income New Yorkers.\nThere\u2019s an interesting civics lesson taking place at the moment in the New York City neighborhood known as Chelsea, an area of Manhattan sandwiched between the high-rises of Midtown and low-slung, picturesque Greenwich Village.\nOn the other hand, of course, is the fact that housing for middle-income families in nice neighborhoods is hard to find."}
