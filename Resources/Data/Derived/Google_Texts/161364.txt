Catching up with the times, CBS this year allowed affiliates and owned stations in the Pacific and Mountain time zones (like KCNC-Channel 4 in Denver) to opt into a live broadcast of the Grammy Awards. The show won’t be tape-delayed here to synch with primetime and higher ad rates as in the past.

The 58th Annual Grammy Awards, hosted by two-time Grammy winner LL COOL J, will be broadcast live Monday, Feb. 15, even here in the Mountain time zone, from 6-9:30 p.m. The red carpet hoopla can be seen starting at 5 p.m. MT.

That means for once the Twitter comments from the East Coast won’t ruin the surprises locally. We won’t have to studiously avoid commentary while awaiting the old-fashioned delayed broadcast.

The 2015 Grammy telecast scored an average 24.8 million viewers.

Performers this year include Adele; Alabama Shakes; Joey Alexander; Justin Bieber; Jackson Browne; Luke Bryan; Gary Clark, Jr.; Andra Day; Diplo; Don Henley, Bernie Leadon, Timothy B. Schmit and Joe Walsh of the Eagles; Ellie Goulding; the Broadway cast of “Hamilton”; Alice Cooper, Johnny Depp and Joe Perry of The Hollywood Vampires; Sam Hunt; Tori Kelly; Lady Gaga; Kendrick Lamar; John Legend; Little Big Town; Demi Lovato; Miguel, Pitbull; Bonnie Raitt; Rihanna; Skrillex; Chris Stapleton; Taylor Swift; Robin Thicke; Meghan Trainor; Carrie Underwood; and The Weeknd.
