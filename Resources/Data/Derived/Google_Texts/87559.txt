Getty McMorris Rodgers urges GOP to pull together

House Republican Conference Chairman Cathy McMorris Rodgers sent a note to colleagues Monday afternoon urging her fellow lawmakers to unite together.

House Republicans are scheduled to gather Tuesday evening for a "Members-only" meeting without staff or leadership staff "so we can only share productive, forward-looking perspectives about how we empower Members, and thereby empower the American people through their representatives," the Washington Republican wrote.

She added: "This conference meeting is not about any one leader or group of Members. All of us want to work together with the trust and respect our service demands, and it starts with opening lines of communication on Tuesday."

McMorris Rodgers is weighing a bid for House Majority Leader. She currently serves as the No. 4 Republican leader.

"Over the summer, I met with many of you to brainstorm about our shared vision for America. Those conversations were focused on the future. However, until we address short-term frustrations and tactics, we will never achieve that vision," McMorris Rodgers wrote. "With the same constructiveness, Tuesday’s conference meeting can be an opportunity for us to listen to one another, learn from each other, and lead together."
