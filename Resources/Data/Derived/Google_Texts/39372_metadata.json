Investors include about seven of the top 10 investors in the firm's previous fund, plus new investors such as PKA AIP, which announced a $125 million commitment to HGGC in September. PKA AIP also co-invested in the Serena Software deal.\n\nStaying at around $1 billion works for the firm because its model is people-intensive. HGGC pairs two of four partners (Lawson, former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Steve Young, former Bain exec Greg Benson and former Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) CFO Gary Crittenden) up with each company. The $1 billion fund size, coupled with the firm's targeted middle-market investment size and hold periods, mean that raising a larger fund that would need to do more deals does not work for the firm's current business model.\n\nGenerally, the firm raises employees internally, according to Lawson. \"If we promoted two more people internally, then we could add a few more deals, and a fund might get a little larger \u0096 but we'd still be doing the same size deals,\" Lawson says.\n\nHGGC plans to make 10 platform investments from the fund, and has already made four of them: AutoAlert, which provides cloud-based data and analytics services to the automotive market; Pearl Holding Group, an insurance-services company; Serena Software, an information technology business; and Survey Sampling International, which provides data and technology services for consumer and business-to-business research.\n\nWith the new fund, HGGC now has more than $2.4 billion in capital commitments.
