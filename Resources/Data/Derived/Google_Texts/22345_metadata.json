Charlie Baker appears to be throwing his support behind fellow governor Chris Christie, according to CNN.\n\nThe Republican from Swampscott had been noticeably silent on the matter of endorsing anyone in the race during public appearances. Asked in late December if he would back a candidate, Baker told the Springfield Republican newspaper\u2019s MassLive website that he prefers to keep his focus on running state government.\n\nBut Baker has apparently changed his mind.\n\nThe political ties between Baker and Christie run deep after the New Jersey governor, who has also had to deal with a legislature controlled by Democrats, came to Massachusetts in 2010 to campaign for Baker in his unsuccessful race against incumbent governor Deval Patrick. Four years later, a Christie-led Republican Governors Association funneled more than $11 million into Baker\u2019s tight gubernatorial contest against then-Attorney General Martha Coakley. Baker and former Gov. Mitt Romney in 2014 headlined an RGA fundraiser in Boston for Christie.\n\nHere\u2019s who other Massachusetts republicans are endorsing:\n\nJeb Bush\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has managed to snag several high-profile endorsements from former elected officials, although none of the state\u2019s active crop of lawmakers has thrown his or her support to the son and brother of former presidents.\n\nThe list of Bush supporters includes former Massachusetts Republican governors Jane Swift and Bill Weld, along with former Lt. Gov. Kerry Healey and Massachusetts\u2019 National Republican Committeeman Ron Kaufman. Kaufman in his endorsement statement described Bush as a \u201ctrue conservative leader with a long-term vision for this country and the skills to implement it.\u201d\n\nTed Cruz\n\nTed Cruz has picked up support from one of the most conservative lawmakers in the state, Rep. Jim Lyons of Andover. Lyons, who Cruz named in October as his Massachusetts campaign chairman, hosted Cruz at his home last May, drawing 600 supporters of the first-term Texas senator.\n\nThank you @RepJimLyons for organizing a #CruzCrew canvas in Hudson, NH, yesterday! pic.twitter.com/ojTbZ2vpZ6 \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) Jan. 10, 2016\n\n\u201cI think Ted is exactly what this country needs at this time,\u201d Lyons said in October on Facebook. \u201cHe\u2019s someone who\u2019s willing to take on the establishment and the status quo in Washington.\u201d\n\nOne of Cruz\u2019s GOP Senate colleagues, Kentucky\u2019s Rand Paul, backed out of the presidential nomination race following Iowa\u2019s results. Paul\u2019s departure left a void for Massachusetts National Republican Committeewoman Chanel Prunier, who earlier this year endorsed him. On Thursday Prunier said Cruz is now her candidate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that conservatives are coalescing around Sen. Ted Cruz after his big win in Iowa, and moving forward I\u2019m going to be encouraging supporters of Rand, as well as other presidential candidates, to unify in support of Cruz,\u201d Prunier said by email. She cited his track record of being unafraid to \u201cspeak out about his faith and to fight for what\u2019s right\u201d as one of the Texan\u2019s greatest strengths.\n\nCarly Fiorina\n\nCarly Fiorina, the only woman in the GOP hunt has netted the support of Republican state Reps. Kate Campanale of Leicester, Sheila Harrington of Groton, Kevin Kuros of Uxbridge and Shauna O\u2019Connell of Taunton. The lawmakers officially announced their endorsements for the former Hewlett Packard chief executive from California in October.\n\nKuros said he was \u201cexcited that so many Massachusetts state leaders\u201d elected to support Fiorina, in a prepared statement at the time. O\u2019Connell said part of what drove her to back the Californian was that she had managed to \u201cwork her way up\u201d to become the first woman to lead a Fortune 20 company. Harrington noted that she has \u201cnever been this excited about a candidate on the national stage\u201d than she is about Fiorina.\n\nJohn Kasich\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich has a big supporter in the Republican leader in the Massachusetts Senate, Bruce Tarr of Gloucester. Tarr, who endorsed Kasich last month, said in a statement that he admires the former congressman\u2019s demonstrated ability to \u201cspur a robust economy\u201d in Ohio.\n\n\u201cNow more than ever, voters in New England and across the country need a leader with the temperament and executive experience to make America strong again,\u201d Tarr said. He also pointed to Kasich\u2019s record of reaching a deal to balance the federal budget and strengthening the military as a member of Congress.\n\nKasich also netted endorsements from Republican state Reps. Paul Frost of Auburn, Kimberly Ferguson of Holden, Peter Durant of Spencer and F. Jay Barrows of Mansfield in September, along with former Bay State congressman Peter Torkildsen.\n\nThe former congressman from the North Shore recalled serving alongside Kasich while both were in the Capitol and noted that Kasich\u2019s \u201cleadership and resolve were the key factors in balancing the federal budget.\u201d\n\nFrost said he admired Kasich\u2019s experience while Ferguson remarked that Kasich has a track record of leading \u201con issues impacting children, the elderly and those with developmental disabilities.\u201d\n\nMarco Rubio\n\nSome made their choices long ago. Marco Rubio became the first to attract a GOP backer from Beacon Hill even before he jumped in the race.\n\nState Sen. Ryan Fattman, a Sutton Republican, set himself up in Rubio\u2019s corner ahead of the senator from Florida officially jumped in last April. Fattman has been a frequent foot soldier for the Cuban-American, spending significant amounts of time knocking on doors in New Hampshire.\n\nFattman has helped promote the Twitter hashtag #MarcosMinutemen, a nod to the candidate\u2019s Bay State volunteers. Like Rubio, who is 44 years old, Fattman at 31 is also one of the youngest members in his legislative chamber.\n\n\u201cI thought of that hashtag as a way to rally people,\u201d Fattman said by phone recently. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019m able to do by the nature of being in politics is recruit other volunteers.\u201d\n\nFattman spoke as he was driving back from another round of New Hampshire canvassing. Fattman said he reached out to the Rubio campaign even before the senator announced his plans to run.\n\n\u201cMy wife and I got to know him when he did some campaigning in 2012 for Scott Brown,\u201d Fattman said, recalling the former Massachusetts senator\u2019s failed bid for a full six-year term.\n\nFattman says he quickly formed a bond with Rubio. In 2012, Fattman was in his 20s and approaching the end of his first term as a state representative. Fattman said he could identify with Rubio, who was just 29 when he was first elected to the Florida House of Representatives in Tallahassee.\n\n\u201cHe spent a lot of time getting to know me and my wife,\u201d Fattman said. \u201cHe connected with both of us and I remember telling my wife after the first night we met him, \u2018If he runs for president one day, I want to help out.\u2019\u201d\n\nRubio is the candidate who can best identify with younger voters and is the GOP contender best suited for the 21st century, Fattman says.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s looking at the world from a new perspective and this is where Republicans need to focus, on a new American century, on the future,\u201d the state senator added. \u201cIf you think about what\u2019s happening in the country, and how it\u2019s changing, he cares.\u201d\n\nOut of just six GOP state senators in Massachusetts, Rubio has been endorsed by three, including Richard Ross of Wrentham and Vinny deMacedo of Plymouth. The three are all on Rubio\u2019s Bay State leadership team.\n\nThe other members of that team include state representatives Keiko Orrall of Lakeville and Shawn Dooley of Norfolk, along with Bob Maginn, a former Massachusetts Republican Party chairman.\n\nAs for the rest of the field, most of the remaining candidates have Bay State GOP backers. But some don\u2019t.\n\nDonald Trump\n\nAn interesting sidelight to the inner workings of political endorsements is that New York billionaire Donald Trump hasn\u2019t landed the backing of any current Bay State lawmakers, even though he\u2019s leading in polls of likely voters in New Hampshire. But Scott Brown, now a Granite State resident, threw his support to the former reality television star earlier this week.\n\nRetired neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson is still without an endorsement from a Massachusetts lawmaker.\n\nThis article has been updated to reflect Charlie Baker\u2019s expected endorsement of Chris Christie.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2016/02/04/baker-expected-to-back-christie-other-mass-pols-make-endorsements/", "article_author_name": "Evan Lips", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/GOP-2016-Debate_Jank.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "2016 presidential election, Charlie Baker, contenders, GOP, Massachusetts, politics, presidential, republican, Republican primary, Republicans"}, "description": "With the results of this week\u2019s Iowa caucuses further whittling down the list of Republican presidential contenders, Massachusetts Gov.
