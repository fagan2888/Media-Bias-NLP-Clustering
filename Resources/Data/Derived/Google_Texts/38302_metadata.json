About one in three malpractice claims is ultimately paid. In the claims the researchers reviewed, one-third resulted in patient death and another 54 percent in serious injury.\n\nThe study noted that only 6 percent of doctors had any paid claims over the 10-year period studied.\n\nThe researchers said that the \u201cclaim-prone\u201d physicians were disproportionately male (82 percent) and were older, rather than younger. More than half the claims were by doctors in one of four areas: internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, general surgery and general practice or family medicine.\n\nBut the biggest predictor of all in the claim-prone doctors was whether they\u2019d had a prior claim.\n\n\u201cCompared to physicians with only one previous claim,\u201d Studdert said, \u201ca physician who has had three previous claims is three times as likely to have another one. A physician who has had four is four times more likely and so on.\u201d\n\nIn the study the researchers are clear that they have identified risk factors but that it is up to health care systems, hospital and malpractice insurers to identify and work with these doctors. But they noted that few of these organizations do.\n\n\u201cWith notable exception,\u201d the researchers write, \u201cfewer still systematically identify and intervene with practitioners who are at high risk for future claims.\u201d They call for further investigation into predicting which doctors are at risk and then implementing interventions such as training and supervision to improve their quality of care.\n\nIn California, patients can look up their doctor on the state\u2019s medical board website. Depending on the type of malpractice settlement, it will be part of the public record if the doctor has had either three or four settlements within a five-year period. Other information is also available, including whether your doctor has had a felony conviction or is on probation. Patients can use the website simply to determine that a doctor\u2019s license is valid.\n\nBut advocates like Lisa McGiffert, with Consumers Union\u2019s Safe Patient Project, say that\u2019s not enough and have been pushing the Medical Board of California to require that doctors placed on probation notify their patients. The board has resisted taking this step.\n\nWhile probation and multiple malpractice claims are not necessarily linked, McGiffert says she hopes doctors will pay attention to this study. \u201cBecause I have this sense that doctors as a group protect other doctors who are on probation or get in trouble because they think it might happen to them,\u201d she said, but since this study demonstrates that a small percentage of doctors are responsible for a disproportionate number of claims, it should be reassuring to physicians.\n\n\u201cThis study is one more piece of information that regulators can use in determining their strategy in addressing the small percentage of doctors who have problems in their treatment of patients,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "National analysis finds that 1 percent of doctors are responsible for 32 percent of all paid malpractice cases.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Small Number of Doctors Responsible for Many Malpractice Claims, Stanford Study Shows\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2016\\/01\\/27\\/small-number-of-doctors-responsible-for-many-malpractice-claims-stanford-study-shows\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-01-27 14:01:23\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-01-27 17:03:58\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":143193,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Malpractice\",\"News\",\"Physician Workforce\"],\"categories\":[\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2016\\/01\\/iStock_000005494643_Large-e1453925649461.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "National analysis finds that 1 percent of doctors are responsible for 32 percent of all paid malpractice cases.", "title": "Small Number of Doctors Responsible for Many Malpractice Claims, Stanford Study Shows", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2016/01/27/small-number-of-doctors-responsible-for-many-malpractice-claims-stanford-study-shows/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2016/01/iStock_000005494643_Large-1440x960.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "malpractice,news,physician workforce", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "While probation and multiple malpractice claims are not necessarily linked, McGiffert says she hopes doctors will pay attention to this study.\nThe study noted that only 6 percent of doctors had any paid claims over the 10-year period studied.\nAbout one in three malpractice claims is ultimately paid.\nJust 1 percent of doctors are linked to nearly one-third of all paid malpractice claims, an analysis by researchers at Stanford finds, and those physicians have a set of distinctive characteristics.\nIn the claims the researchers reviewed, one-third resulted in patient death and another 54 percent in serious injury."}
