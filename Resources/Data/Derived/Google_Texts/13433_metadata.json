Women were living longer, but in the process, they were outliving their spouses. And rather than moving to a retirement community or living with their children or friends, they remained in place.\n\nRelated: Where Will 78 Million Boomers Retire? Facing the Challenge of Aging in Place\n\nBut between 1990 and 2014, there was a significant shift, and the share of older adults who were living by themselves declined by three percentage points, to 26 percent, according to a new Pew Research analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data.\n\nThe decline in loneliness was far more pronounced among women than in men. Among older women 65 to 84, the number living alone actually fell from 38 percent to 31 percent in 2014. Among older men, the share who were living alone rose by three percentage points in that same period, from 15 percent to 18 percent.\n\n\u201cOne explanation for this trend is that an increase in life expectancy, especially among men, has made it more likely that older women would be living with their spouses rather than as widows,\u201d the report stated. \u201cOlder men ages 65 to 84, on the other hand, are somewhat less likely to live with a spouse now compared with 1990, though most still do.\u201d\n\nRelated: Millions of Boomers Are Making This Big Retirement Mistake\n\n\u201cLiving arrangements for men in this age group have grown more diverse as a rising share have divorced and not remarried,\u201d the report added.\u201d\n\nRenee Stepler, a Pew researcher and author of the study, said in an interview that the decline in the share of older women living alone is part of a larger change in the life style of older Americans. Increased longevity \u2013 especially for men \u2013 is a major factor. The declining mortality rate for men from heart disease, for example, is one reason.\n\nBut aging baby boomers prefer to stay together in their homes for as long as possible before considering a move to a retirement community or nursing home. Moreover, older adults feel less financially secure and comfortable living alone than living with someone else \u2013 whether with a member of the family or just an acquaintance.\n\nAnd, as Stepler found, this group is eager for social interaction and feels isolated from their families and the outside world living alone.\n\nRelated: The Worst States for Retirement in 2015\n\n\u201cMen who live alone are less likely than men who live with others to say they are very satisfied with the number of friends they have,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we found that adults living alone are in less frequent contact with their children and grandchildren as well. There are some important factors there on the social life.\u201d\n\nJohn Rother, president of the National Coalition on Health Care and a former top official of AARP, said Monday, \u201cIt is true that longevity has increased quite dramatically, at least for middle class and better educated people in the United States.\u201d\n\nA 44-year study released last October by the American Cancer Society found that the death rates dropped by about 43 percent, while mortality rates for various ailments including strokes, heart disease and cancer, also fell. But the study cautioned that the rate of decline in death rates had slowed in the most recent period for some obesity-related illnesses, including heart disease, stroke and diabetes, according to The New York Times.\n\n\u201cIt really comes down to lifestyle,\u201d Rother said. \u201cThe key thing that\u2019s changed and that\u2019s hopeful is longevity for men. That of course contributes to couples continuing to live together and less time for usually the surviving female to be on her own.\u201d\n\nRelated: 10 Best Cities for a Healthy Retirement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all positive, but of course the good news is outweighed by the sheer numbers of baby boomers who are now headed into their 70s,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re still going to have millions of older women living alone, but not as many perhaps as we thought earlier.\u201d\n\nJulie Gray, a senior executive with Aging Wisdom, a consulting firm in Seattle that helps families \u201cnavigate options for aging well,\u201d said that baby boomers are demanding and getting numerous lifestyle alternatives that enable them to remain connected with their families or friends while postponing a move to an assisted living facility or nursing home.\n\nAbout 78 million baby boomers are at or near retirement. Many independent-minded seniors are resisting the pressure to move to costly retirement communities or assisted living facilities and are instead making plans to stay at home.\n\nGray said that seniors living in the Seattle area have access to house or apartment sharing arrangements; community services that allow couples or individuals to continue to age in place, or what she called \u201cvirtue villages\u201d where seniors live in the same neighborhood or community and help one another.\n\nRelated: Is There a Less Painful Way to Fix Social Security?\n\n\u201cThe nice thing is that as time goes on, people are demanding a variety of options, and they\u2019re not willing to settle for just moving into a nursing home,\u201d Gray said in an interview. \u201cI think that\u2019s a function of the baby boom population. Baby boomers have always redefined how they want to live. And they certainly are an active group. They organize together. That\u2019s why I think more and more of these virtual villages will start to pop up.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "There has been a subtle but important shift in the life style of older Americans in re", "title": "Living Longer and Better Is Making Retiring in Place Less Lonely", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/23/Living-Longer-Living-Better-Are-Making-Retiring-Place-Less-Lonely", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08132012_retirement_oldcouple_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/23/Living-Longer-Living-Better-Are-Making-Retiring-Place-Less-Lonely", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08132012_retirement_oldcouple_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "There has been a subtle but important shift in the life style of older Americans in re", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Among older women 65 to 84, the number living alone actually fell from 38 percent to 31 percent in 2014.\nAnd rather than moving to a retirement community or living with their children or friends, they remained in place.\nAmong older men, the share who were living alone rose by three percentage points in that same period, from 15 percent to 18 percent.\nWomen were living longer, but in the process, they were outliving their spouses.\nBaby boomers have always redefined how they want to live."}
