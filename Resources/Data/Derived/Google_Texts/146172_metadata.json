I would like to express my sincere apologies to the Town Council members, Mayor William Dickinson, Dr. Salvatore Menzo, all Town and Board of Education staff and all others in attendance for this reaction. It is certainly not what I expect from myself, regardless of the cause or circumstance, and I am ashamed of my reaction. Finally, to the citizens of the town of Wallingford: I will continue to conduct myself in the same professional and positive manner that those who know and work with me have come to expect, as I have for the past 25 years of my public employment. I offer this apology to all of you as well.\n\nJames Bowes, comptroller, Town of Wallingford\n\nSurprising\n\nEditor:\n\nOn Tuesday, March 29, Senator Bartolomeo voted against the budget reconciliation bill. She was the only Democratic state senator to vote against the bill. She spoke on the floor of the senate to explain her vote and to state what her alternative would be. Her alternative was surprising and hypocritical. She stated that she would rather suspend property tax relief payments that were the lone concession to taxpayers in the 2015 bill (part of the second largest tax hike in Connecticut history). That\u2019s the tax relief she bragged about and took credit for in her taxpayer paid-for mailer a few months ago. What hypocrisy!\n\nMike Burris, Meriden\n\nBudget priority\n\nEditor:\n\nRepresentative Abercrombie deserves to be commended for championing the home care and respite services that provides vital assistance to our seniors and caregiver families \u2014 and saves the state millions of dollars. Hundreds of thousands of Connecticut\u2019s residents are the primary resource of care for parents, a spouse or other loved ones.\n\nThe job they do \u2014 one that is 24/7/365 \u2014 allows seniors to be at home where they want to be at about one-third the cost of nursing home care.\n\nWithout the contributions from family caregivers and the support they receive through the Connecticut Home Care Program for Elders and Alzheimer\u2019s respite care, taxpayers will be on the hook for millions more in nursing home costs.\n\nThank you, Representative Abercrombie and our legislative leaders for making home care and respite a budget priority. We must ensure seniors and their families will have the support they need to live with dignity and independence in their communities.\n\nJanet Ferracci-Carter, Southington\n\nNot fooled\n\nEditor:\n\nLen Suzio and Carol Platt Liebau are peddling their discredited, ultra-conservative ideology in the opinion pages of the Record-Journal. In his columns, Suzio argues in defense of the super-wealthy and multi-national companies who dodge their tax obligations. He blames undocumented immigrants for the plight of our low-wage workers, rather than the despicable employment practices of colossal retailers and fast food chains. He disparages the success of the Affordable Care Act in providing health insurance to an additional 40 million Americans. Liebau opposes legislation that targets companies with at least 500 employees that fail to pay a living wage \u2014 companies whose profits we taxpayers must subsidize by providing public assistance to their struggling workers.\n\nPerhaps most frustrating, these apologists for the privileged few insult two of our most respected lawmakers. Suzio, still wallowing in sour grapes after two election losses to Senator Dant\u00e9 Bartolomeo, berates her for standing up for middle class families. Liebau criticizes Representative Cathy Abercrombie for supporting the fair wage bill that would benefit both abused employees and over-burdened taxpayers.\n\nSuzio and Liebau rail against progress in the shameful tradition of those who opposed social security, Medicare and the minimum wage. Today their brand of politics has devastated America\u2019s middle class, producing the most extreme income inequality since the Gilded Age. They may try to dress up their arguments with phony concern for average citizens, but we are not fooled.\n\nJeffrey Freiser, Meriden\n\nLiving on less\n\nEditor:\n\nWe\u2019ve lost GE and now it\u2019s only a matter of time before Aetna leaves the Insurance Capitol of the World... Sorry my fellow Connecticut residents ... you voted for this fool of a Governor not once, but twice. You voted for him based on his promise to continue to feed and protect your Democrat political donating unions. You cared only for yourselves yesterday and cared nothing about your future. Today, he\u2019s laying you off by the thousands because his policies were all fluff, his budget was full of lies and he never cared about your jobs ... only your votes. He won ... You lost. Tomorrow he\u2019ll be a rich Democrat living in Washington. And you? You\u2019ll be like the rest of us. Living on less because your taxes have risen in order to pay for the mess this man has created. Congratulations Connecticut voters ... you\u2019ve created \u201cDetroit By The Sea.\u201d\n\nTim Roy, Wallingford", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Record-Journal is a local print and digital daily newspaper covering local news, sports and community news in the Central Connecticut area", "author": "Record-Journal Publishing Co", "og": {"type": "website"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Add to Home", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"admins": "recordjournal.richierathsack", "app_id": 355445577906945}, "keywords": "Record Journal,RecordJournal,MyRecordJournal,Meriden,Wallingford,Southington,Berlin,Cheshire,Plainville,North Haven,Citizen,Durham,Town Times,newspaper,headlines,publication,editorial,local news,state news,regional news,sports,community,commentary,opinion,features,events,central connecticut,connecticut,ct,police,courts,obituaries,epaper,digital,archives,spotted,front porch,business,national,classifieds,schools", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Record Journal,RecordJournal,MyRecordJournal,Meriden,Wallingford,Southington,Berlin,Cheshire,Plainville,North Haven,Citizen,Durham,Town Times,newspaper,headlines,publication,editorial,local news,state news,regional news,sports,community,commentary,opinion,features,events,central connecticut,connecticut,ct,police,courts,obituaries,epaper,digital,archives,spotted,front porch,business,national,classifieds,schools"}, "article_summary": "Liebau criticizes Representative Cathy Abercrombie for supporting the fair wage bill that would benefit both abused employees and over-burdened taxpayers.\nApologyEditor:At the public hearing on the Wallingford Town Budget on Thursday, April 7, I reacted unprofessionally to a citizen\u2019s public misrepresentation of prior conversations I had with him regarding budget issues.\nJames Bowes, comptroller, Town of WallingfordSurprisingEditor:On Tuesday, March 29, Senator Bartolomeo voted against the budget reconciliation bill.\nThat\u2019s the tax relief she bragged about and took credit for in her taxpayer paid-for mailer a few months ago.\nShe spoke on the floor of the senate to explain her vote and to state what her alternative would be."}
