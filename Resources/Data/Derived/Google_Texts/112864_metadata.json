The USCCB has been contracted by the federal government to care for the surge of unaccompanied minors crossing into the U.S.\n\nThe group claims that the USCCB has been denying reproductive care for immigrants based on its religious doctrines and that by doing so the organization is breaking the rules of its contract with the federal government to provide necessary healthcare for immigrants.\n\nThe suit has sparked outrage among religious, anti-abortion, and civil rights groups who argue the ACLU is more concerned with bullying the Catholic church than helping vulnerable immigrants.\n\n\u201cLawsuits like the one the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) just filed demanding all of the records on a faith-based provider of care and services to vulnerable children are destructive and divisive,\u201d said Brian Walsh, president of the Civil Rights Research Center in a statement. \u201cWhen it comes to religious freedom, some organizations that have had a laudable history of defending Americans\u2019 religious civil rights and liberties are looking less and less like their former selves.\u201d\n\nLegal experts say that despite the contract agreement, federal law protects USCCB\u2019s religious rights and say ACLU\u2019s case aims to strip religion from the public sphere.\n\n\u201cThe larger issue \u2014 religious liberty \u2014 is the constitutional issue of our time,\u201d said Jerad Najvar, founder of Najvar law firm in Houston, Texas. \u201cWe are coming to a tipping point in this country. Right now it\u2019s an attempt to sanitize religious principles from religious charities and schools that receive government assistance. Next it will be denying religious freedom to even privately-funded charities that are open to the public. It\u2019s time for Catholics to recognize the trajectory here, and stand up before it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nBut Brigitte Amiri, a senior staff attorney at ACLU told The Times that group is concerned that by accepting federal money to care for immigrants and then denying them reproductive healthcare the USCCB may be in violation of the Constitutional separation of Church and state.\n\nAccording to Ms. Amiri the government\u2019s contract with USCCB requires the group to abide by a number of federal laws including a settlement agreement that requires children in the government\u2019s custody to receive access to routine medical services, including family planning services.\n\nACLU has received complaints that USCCB has been denying reproductive healthcare services, such as abortions, for female immigrants, many of whom suffer sexual assault or rape during their journey to the U.S., Ms. Amiri said.\n\nAlmost 60,000 unaccompanied minors illegally crossed the U.S./Mexico borer last year. Nearly a third were young girls and up to 80 percent of those girls were victims of sexual assault. USCCB was awarded a $73 million overall contract and received $10 million in 2013 alone to care for those unaccompanied minors.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think that religious organizations should be awarded the contract if they are unable to do the work that is required,\u201d said Ms. Amiri. \u201cBecause this contract was to provide day to day care to these teens including medical care, they need to be able to deliver the full range of whats required under the contract. We wouldn\u2019t say its ok in any circumstance for a contractor to say \u2018I want the money\u2019 and then not do the work.\u201d\n\nThe USCCB said that it has been successfully caring for needy children for years, without providing contraception or abortions and will continue to do so.\n\n\u201cWe ensure children and youth have access to ongoing medical and social services. This extensive health care would include, in the case of pregnancy, prenatal, labor/delivery and well-baby care. For decades, we have provided exemplary services to this vulnerable population without facilitating abortions, and despite ACLU\u2019s extreme assertions to the contrary, the law not only permits our doing so, but protects it,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nIn a February 2015 letter to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the USCCB, which serves the largest faith-based refugee resettlement organization, wrote that forcing the charities to provide abortion services for immigrants in their care, even by referring pregnant teens to another organization to perform the procedure, would constitute the church facilitating a request that they view as morally wrong and would violate their religious freedoms.\n\nReligious organizations and anti-abortion groups blasted the ACLU for hypocritically targeting the Catholic church for violating human rights while simultaneously supporting groups like Planned parenthood which violates the human rights of unborn children.\n\n\u201cThe ACLU is arguing senselessly that because the Catholic Church is a government contractor that provides crucial services to illegal minors, they must also provide abortions for them, which the Church considers a grave moral evil. What about government contractor Planned Parenthood? They have been caught multiple times putting minors in harm\u2019s way by refusing to report rape and child abuse and have been found guilty in double-billing taxpayers for \u2018services\u2019 they perform, yet they still receive over $1.4 million per day in taxpayer dollar,\u201d said Kristan Hawkins, President of Students for Life of America\n\nMark Reinzi, associate professor at the Catholic University of America, Columbus School of Law told The Times that the ACLU shouldn\u2019t aim to push the Catholic church out of public service and \u201cstrip everybody of all the good work that it does,\u201d and added that \u201cthe world would be a lot worse place if the ACLU succeeds.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government to force religious charities contracted by the government to provide abortions and contraception to illegal immigrants.", "Author": "Kellan Howell", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government to force religious charities contracted by the government to provide abortions and contraception to illegal immigrants.", "title": "ACLU sues feds to force Catholic charities to provide abortions for illegal immigrants", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/23/aclu-lawsuit-pushes-feds-force-catholic-charities-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/19/454b23e710909d086e0f6a706700ebac.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/19/454b23e710909d086e0f6a706700ebac.jpg", "title": "ACLU sues feds to force Catholic charities to provide abortions for il", "description": "The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government to force religious charities contracted by the government to provide abortions and contraception to illegal immigrant", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Religion Belief, Politics, American Civil Liberties Union, Usccb"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec9d\"", "article_summary": "A lawsuit filed this month by The American Civil Liberties Union could force Catholic charities to provide contraception and abortions for illegal immigrants in their care.\nThe suit has sparked outrage among religious, anti-abortion, and civil rights groups who argue the ACLU is more concerned with bullying the Catholic church than helping vulnerable immigrants.\n\u201cThe ACLU is arguing senselessly that because the Catholic Church is a government contractor that provides crucial services to illegal minors, they must also provide abortions for them, which the Church considers a grave moral evil.\nRight now it\u2019s an attempt to sanitize religious principles from religious charities and schools that receive government assistance.\nThe ACLU is demanding government records detailing reproductive healthcare policies for immigrant children and teens in shelters operated by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB)."}
