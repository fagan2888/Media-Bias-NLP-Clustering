The investment paid off for Hurley, which gets 10 to 15 calls a day from people who see the advertisement, and saw hernia volume increase 140 percent, Michael McCann, director of the Hurley Hernia Center of Excellence and chief of Hurley's trauma and surgical care unit, told MLive.\n\n\"I think the billboard being the biggest bang for the buck is accurate and we will continue to use that option,\" John Stewart, administrator for emergency and trauma services at Hurley, told MLive.\n\nMcLaren Flint hospital also uses billboard advertising, which brought in business especially when used as part of an overall integrated media campaign, McLaren Health Care corporate director of marketing, Lauri Prochazka told MLive. The bariatric and metabolic surgery programs saw a 38 percent growth in patient volume last year after an outdoor, electronic, print and online media campaign that ran from last year through the beginning of 2014. Now the hospital is 34 percent ahead of 2014 patient volume, according to the article.\n\nDespite the success of the billboards, Nicole Fisher, president and CEO of HHR Strateigies, a healthcare advising firm, recently wrote in Forbes that social media and online advertising play a crucial role in healthcare advertising. \"Social media influences 93 percent of shoppers final purchase decisions,\" she said. \"Further, 90 percent of consumers indicate that they trust peer recommendations. Therefore, previous patients are your greatest allies. Their reviews online matter more than you think.\"\n\nTargeting specific audiences is also important, Fisher wrote. Think about exactly who needs to see an ad and what information they'll look for when hospitals create marketing strategy campaign.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the MLive article\n\n- read the Forbes article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCommunicating with patients: Stick with the tried and true\n\n5 hospital marketing campaigns that push the envelope\n\n5 tips for hospitals in a consumer-driven market\n\n6 top 2014 healthcare marketing trends", "article_metadata": {"description": "In an age where\u00a0social media engages new customers and Internet advertising targets younger users,\u00a0MLive\u00a0reports\u00a0a handful of Michigan hospitals now use an old-fashioned\u00a0marketing\u00a0technique to bring in new patients: billboards.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "In an age where\u00a0social media engages new customers and Internet advertising targets younger users,\u00a0MLive\u00a0reports\u00a0a handful of Michigan hospitals now use an old-fashioned\u00a0marketing\u00a0technique to bring in new patients: billboards.", "title": "Old-fashioned marketing technique brings in targeted patients", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/old-fashioned-marketing-technique-brings-targeted-patients/2014-08-04", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Hospital Marketing,Hurley Medical Center,marketing,Operations & Business Management,social media,target audience", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Marketing,Operations & Business Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda194\"", "article_summary": "In an age where social media engages new customers and Internet advertising targets younger users, MLive reports a handful of Michigan hospitals now use an old-fashioned marketing technique to bring in new patients: billboards.\n\"Social media influences 93 percent of shoppers final purchase decisions,\" she said.\nThink about exactly who needs to see an ad and what information they'll look for when hospitals create marketing strategy campaign.\n\"I think the billboard being the biggest bang for the buck is accurate and we will continue to use that option,\" John Stewart, administrator for emergency and trauma services at Hurley, told MLive.\nTo learn more:- here's the MLive article- read the Forbes articleRelated Articles:Communicating with patients: Stick with the tried and true5 hospital marketing campaigns that push the envelope5 tips for hospitals in a consumer-driven market6 top 2014 healthcare marketing trends"}
