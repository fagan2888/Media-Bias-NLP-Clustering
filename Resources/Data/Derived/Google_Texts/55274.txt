The Butler Sheriff's Office has identified a man shot and killed by a deputy Friday afternoon.

It happened around 1:20 p.m. on Highway 54 about a mile east of Rosalia. The sheriff's office received the report of a man in a truck pointing a rifle out of the window.

"I don't know what this other gentleman's intention was, sitting there with a rifle alongside of the state highway with it sticking out of the window," said Butler County Sheriff Kelly Herzet.

For half an hour, deputies tried talking to the man. When he finally exited his truck, Herzet said he was pointing his rifle and was shot by a deputy.

"We don't try to end it in a hurry," Herzet said. "However many hours it takes to get him out of there in a safe manner and get him help is the focus we have. But when you get out of a vehicle with a weapon and go to point at law enforcement or whatever, I don't want to go into detail. But things happen and we're trained and it's a sad situation."

On Saturday, Sheriff Herzet identified the man as 51-year-old Manford "Butch" Moore, Jr.

The name of the deputy involved was not released.

The Flint Hills superintendent told KAKE News grades 3 through 12 were on lockdown from 1:30 to 2:05 p.m.

The KBI was on scene investigating, and Highway 54 was closed between Flinthills Road and Gray Road.
