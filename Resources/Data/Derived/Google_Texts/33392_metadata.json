However, it is something that everyone needs.\u201d\n\nOther offerings included Pap smears and mammograms for women, physical exams, EKGs, chiropractic services and consultations with surgical specialists.\n\n\u201cAll these cares are important,\u201d Patel said, \u201cbecause it is the middle group that suffers the most.\u201d\n\nA significant number of volunteers helped patients navigate the long lines of tables and sections set up for the various testings and consulations.\n\n\u201cI am volunteering for all three days until 5 p.m.,\u201d Colleen Fleming said. \u201cI am a pre-med student, so I thought that it would be a good idea to help out here.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"content_section": "news", "description": "News: 2,500 get medical help over three-day fair | number, medical, care, dental, three, patients, site, friday, rivera, most", "author": "ELAINE LEE", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "By increasing the number of days to three for its ninth annual community health fair, and partnering with a mobile healthcare nonprofit, the city brought in a record number \u2013 about 2,500 \u2013 of patients over the weekend.", "title": "2,500 get medical help over three-day fair", "url": "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/number-663892-medical-care.html", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/npai8g-b88423642z.120150601164812000g9ka2phd.10.jpg", "locale": "en-US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/npai8g-b88423642z.120150601164812000g9ka2phd.10.jpg"}, "description": "By increasing the number of days to three for its ninth annual community health fair, and partnering with a mobile healthcare nonprofit, the city brought in a record number \u2013 about 2,500 \u2013 of pati", "site": "@ocregister", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "2,500 get medical help over three-day fair"}, "content_author": "ELAINE LEE", "fb": {"app_id": 107698536003308}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/thumb/npai8g-b88423642z.120150601164812000g9ka2phd.10.jpg", "content_type": "article", "Keywords": "number, medical, care, dental, three, patients, site, friday, rivera, most", "publication_date": "2015-06-01", "access-type": "paid", "section": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "content_title": "2,500 get medical help over three-day fair"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0164\"", "article_summary": "By increasing the number of days to three for its ninth annual community health fair, and partnering with a mobile healthcare nonprofit, the city brought in a record number \u2013 about 2,500 \u2013 of patients over the weekend.\n\u201cI am a pre-med student, so I thought that it would be a good idea to help out here.\u201d\n\u201cPeople tend to come for medical aid that is not necessarily covered in the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Team Leader Coordinator Dipak Patel said.\nPatient Lizbeth Rivera, who attended Friday, said although it was her first time at one of the fairs, she was getting much more medical care than she expected.\n\u201cHowever, partnering with Remote Area Medical, who could provide on-site eye glasses along with increased dental capacity of on-site treatment from 14 chairs to 70 chairs made a difference as well,\u201d he said."}
