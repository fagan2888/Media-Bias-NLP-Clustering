The problem with the Green Lantern theory is that it ignores the reality of a determined Republican opposition that controls the House and is both capable of keeping the Senate in a state of gridlock and willing to do so. Even great leadership requires some level of followership.\n\n[Check out U.S. News Weekly, an insider's guide to politics and policy.]\n\nNow the fanatical right has developed a corollary view of political power, one better suited for the party that doesn't control the White House. I call it the Keyser Soze Theory of Power. Remember the scene from \"The Usual Suspects\" where Kevin Spacey's character gives the backstory of Soze, the villainous crime lord? He relates that a Hungarian gang hoped to cut into Soze's territory. These criminals had an epiphany: \"They realized that to be in power, you didn't need guns or money or even numbers. You just needed the will to do what the other guy wouldn't.\" So they hold Soze's family hostage, raping his wife. \"Then [Soze] showed these men of will what will really was,\" Spacey continues. Soze kills his own family (\"He tells [them] he would rather see his family dead than live another day after this\") before wreaking vengeance upon the Hungarians and, essentially, anyone they'd ever met.\n\nThis notion of power \u2013 that all it requires is \"the will to do what the other guy wouldn't\" \u2013 is at the core of the fringe right's last-ditch push to stop the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, from taking effect. These conservatives' big idea, pushed by Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, as well as outside groups like the Heritage Foundation's political activist arm, is that Republicans should refuse to fund the government beyond the end of September (when currently authorized funding runs out) unless the president agrees to defund Obamacare. A popular variation would involve refusing to raise the debt ceiling unless Obama agrees to the right's terms. With the law's health insurance exchanges opening up on Oct. 1, conservatives see this as their last chance to scrap the law. These men of will then figure that they'll prevail because they're willing to do what Obama won't: shut down the government or default on U.S. debts and thus imperil the country's credit rating.\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on the Republican Party.]\n\nThere are a couple of problems with this theory, starting with the fact that Republicans don't have enough senators to pass a bill defunding the Affordable Care Act. They could shut down the government instead, but that also wouldn't stop Obamacare, which is mostly funded through mandatory spending. Also, the idea that the president would willingly dismantle his signature legislative achievement weeks or months before it is fully implemented is absurd \u2013 especially in the face of a government shutdown that, most political observers in both parties agree, would redound to his political benefit.\n\nOh yeah, and there's this: It's such a politically unrealistic path to victory that most Republicans in the House and Senate have either declined to support the defund movement or outright denounced it. (North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, for example, has called the defund strategy \"the dumbest idea I've ever heard of.\")\n\nCruz has acknowledged that simply gathering the votes to pass a defund bill would require a \"tsunami\" of public demand for repeal, but there have been few if any signs of a such grass-roots demand. If there were one it would certainly be reflected in the House Republican Conference, but a senior GOP leadership aide recently told National Review Online that \"we haven't seen any indication of a broad groundswell\" in favor of the movement.\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on Obamacare.]\n\nThis is no surprise. Polls show that while Americans don't like the law, they also don't like repeal (owing at least in part to the fact that some people dislike Obamacare not because it goes too far but because it doesn't go far enough).\n\nThe result has been an elevation of the civil war between the fanatic and pragmatic sections of the Republican Party. The Senate Conservatives Fund, for example, this week started airing radio ads attacking seven senators \u2013 all Republicans \u2013 for refusing to sign on to the defund movement. Meanwhile, some conservatives have vowed to start referring to the law as \"Boehnercare\" rather than Obamacare if the House speaker doesn't join the effort.\n\nThere is an increasingly existential, panicky quality to the fringe right's lashing out at the reality-based portion of the party. \"The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist,\" Spacey's character remarks in \"The Usual Suspects.\" The tea party fringe's greatest trick might have been convincing the world that it does exist, as a cohesive and potent political force anyway. But if pragmatists can defy the fanatics with impunity \u2013 and at this point the tea party seems unlikely to successfully pose a threat to GOP incumbents \u2013 it could expose the tea party as a force whose toxicity outweighs its utility.\n\nRead Mary Kate Cary: Tough on Crime and Spending\n\nRead Peter Roff: Kathleen Sebelius\u2019 Obamacare Propaganda Push", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "The Magical Thinking Behind the 'Defund Obamacare' Push", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Leadership is the will to do what the other guy won't.", "title": "The Keyser Soze Theory of Political Power", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2013/09/03/the-magical-thinking-behind-the-defund-obamacare-push", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/99/e1bf6db0401e0691eabfc0ec3b3ca2/46775WideModern_spacey_130830.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Leadership is the will to do what the other guy won't.", "card": "summary", "title": "The Magical Thinking Behind the 'Defund Obamacare' Push"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Sept. 3, 2013", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Robert Schlesinger,Republican Party,Democratic Party,politics,Congress,health care,picks,Politics [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Leadership is the will to do what the other guy won't."}, "article_summary": "The result has been an elevation of the civil war between the fanatic and pragmatic sections of the Republican Party.\nIt's a magical time in Washington \u2013 or at least a time of magical thinking.\nRead Mary Kate Cary: Tough on Crime and SpendingRead Peter Roff: Kathleen Sebelius\u2019 Obamacare Propaganda Push\nI call it the Keyser Soze Theory of Power.\nNow the fanatical right has developed a corollary view of political power, one better suited for the party that doesn't control the White House."}
