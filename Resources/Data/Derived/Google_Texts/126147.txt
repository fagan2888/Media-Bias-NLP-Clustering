Jakarta, Indonesia has threatened to deport the actor Harrison Ford because he was rude to a government official, local media reported on Tuesday.

Ford is currently in Indonesia where he was filming a documentary Years of Living Dangerously, dealing with climate change.

The actor had an discussion on Monday with the country’s Minister of Forestry, Zulkifli Hasan, about the destruction of the forests.

The Indiana Jones actor allegedly stormed into Hasan’s office and started asking “tough questions” even before the cameras started to turn, government spokesman Andi Arief said.

Arief also claimed that Ford stepped on Hasan’s desk.

“There is no special treatment for Harrison Ford, even though he’s a brilliant actor,” Arief said. He continued by saying the crew needs to be questioned as to why Ford insulted the state and, “if necessary, we can deport him.”

Ford was described as being “emotional” when the issue of deforestation was raised during an interview, Jakarta Post reported.

Hasan reported that Ford seems to want anyone who is guilty of destroying the environment to be arrested.

A third of the world’s tropical rainforests are in Indonesia, where orangutans and Sumatran tigers live.
