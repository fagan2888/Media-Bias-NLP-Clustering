Education was the top concern (21 percent) followed by jobs (20 percent). Transportation and taxes also emerged as important concerns this year.\n\nGeorgians are more optimistic than last year about the economy as they report slightly higher rates of satisfaction compared to last year. More than half of the residents polled said they were satisfied with economic development efforts with residents from the Middle and Southern parts of the state expressing the greatest dissatisfaction.\n\nThe poll also highlighted public\u2019s trust in the different levels of government, where the federal and county levels were cited as the most trusted.\n\nThe majority of Georgians continue to be dissatisfied with public education and, like last year, they would be willing to invest more money to improve the system. Georgians also favor the creation of charter schools (55.5 percent) and support the Common Core Standards Initiative (53.4 percent).\n\nOpposition to the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as ObamaCare, increased from last year with more than half of those polled saying they oppose the law.\n\nGeorgians strongly favor legalizing medical marijuana with the strongest support in metro Atlanta and north Georgia.

These findings contribute to many upcoming policy debates,\u201d said Spirou.\n\nThe 2015 Georgia\u2019s State of the State Poll was conducted by a random telephone survey between Feb. 9 and 16, 2015. The margin of error for the survey is +/-4.4 percent. All participants interviewed were 18 years of age or older.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of Georgia\u2019s State of the State Poll is to engage the citizenry and contribute to a statewide conversation about various public policy issues. In the process, our goal is to improve the socioeconomic well-being of the state\u2019s residents,\u201d said Spirou, who co-authored the report with Dr. Min Kim, Georgia College assistant professor of public administration.\n\nShare and Enjoy", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Valdosta Today", "description": "MILLEDGEVILLE -- The Georgia College Department of Government and Sociology has released the second edition of Georgia's State of the State Poll, which takes the pulse of residents on key issues.
