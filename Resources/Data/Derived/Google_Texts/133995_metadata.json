The deal calls for Yair Shalev and his company, Kobeni Inc., which are based in Hollywood, Florida, to pay $350,000 in fines, though the defendants haven\u2019t admitted or denied guilt in the case.\n\nThe FTC suit stems from emails sent to consumers during the roll-out of the Affordable Care Act, which warned them that they would be in violation of the law if they didn\u2019t click immediately to enroll in an insurance plan. The messages offered them links that led to websites that displayed advertisements for insurance companies. The agency said the insurance companies weren\u2019t involved in or aware of the scam, but the proprietors of the web sites receiving the traffic paid Shalev and Kobeni.\n\nHere are two examples of text cited by the FTC:\n\nThe defendants were charged in January with violating the FTC Act by spreading deceptive information about legal deadlines, and with violating the CAN-SPAM Act by failing to allow recipients to opt-out, as well as for failing to include a valid postal address in their emails.\n\nYair Shalev and Kobeni Inc., apparently known as Kobeni Solutions, are well-known in anti-spam circles, appearing as number 2 on a list of the world\u2019s worst spammers maintained by the Spamhaus Register of Known Spam Operations (ROKSO).\n\nOn the site, he\u2019s described as a \u201chigh volume snowshoe spammer from Florida, (former?) partner-in-spam of ROKSO spammer Darrin Wohl. Son-in-law of ROKSO listed spammer Dan Abramovich.\u201d\n\nThe \u201csnowshoe\u201d spam method involves spreading out messaging over a wide variety of IP addresses and domain names, so as to avoid block lists and reputation systems. ROKSO associates Shalev and Kobeni with more than 100 IP addresses and a similar number of domain names, which are currently on the Spamhaus block list.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how the $350K number was reached, but the original lawsuit sought \u201crestitution, disgorgement of ill-gotten monies, and other equitable relief.\u201d\n\nStock image used with permission of Shutterstock.com\n\nAbout The Author Pamela Parker Pamela Parker is Executive Features Editor at Search Engine Land and Marketing Land.
