Gigaom said it doesn\u2019t know what lenders plan to do with the assets, but \u201cthe company does not currently intend to file bankruptcy.\u201d\n\nThe announcement seems to describe a situation in which Gigaom\u2019s lenders are foreclosing on the company\u2019s assets because they weren\u2019t being paid. It\u2019s a very common loan structure, with debt secured by corporate assets. And it\u2019s exactly the kind of situation many companies file for bankruptcy to halt.\n\nIf a lender is on the brink of taking control of a company\u2019s assets, the current owner sometimes will enter bankruptcy in a bid to keep the business. Another alternative is that through bankruptcy, a buyer will emerge. The asset could still winds up in the hands of a lender in bankruptcy, but it\u2019s a more orderly process that encourages participation from all creditors.\n\nUsually, troubled companies choose to file for these reasons. But it\u2019s an expensive process, and that can sometimes keep companies away.\n\nIn a recent post in our Examiners series, Richard Chesley of DLA Piper said, \u201cthe costs of chapter 11 are taking a considerable toll on the smaller and mid-market chapter 11 cases. In these situations, liquidity is almost certainly constrained and access to time and financing is finite. In these cases, there is often a less costly, less desirable processes that companies are forced to consider.\u201d\n\nGigaom didn\u2019t return request for comment Tuesday.\n\nGigaom was founded in 2006 by Om Malik, who\u2019s since left the site, and says it has a monthly audience of 6.5 million. The website\u2019s coverage focused on topics like new technologies including cloud services, the media and Apple Inc.\n\nHowever, Gigaom didn\u2019t use the traditional advertising-funded model that has failed so many news organizations in recent years (although it does also sell ads). The company attempted to drive revenue by selling research and by hosting conferences.\n\nA recent WSJ article about the tough competition for ad dollars among blogs quoted Paul Walborsky, chief executive of Gigaom, about the company\u2019s model.\n\n\u201cThere is no way you can have enough page views and scale to make enough money to support a great editorial brand,\u201d he said.\n\nGigaom raised more than $22 million from six rounds of investor funding, according to CrunchBase. In 2012, GigaOM acquired paidContent for an undisclosed sum.\n\nWrite to Stephanie Gleason at stephanie.gleason@wsj.com.
