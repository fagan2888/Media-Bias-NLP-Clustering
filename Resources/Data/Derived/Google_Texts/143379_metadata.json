He has run out of ideas, and out of gas. His strongest supporters are in the grip of a morbid fatalism. There is nothing the president can do any longer, they sigh, because of the intransigent Republicans in the House of Representatives. The great days of the Obama presidency are behind us, everyone seems to believe, and the most this once-promising president can do now are hold convenings and issue small-bore executive orders while awaiting a round of midterm elections that are likely to go against him. Oh, woe is he.\n\nIt\u2019s time to snap out of it. Obama is still the most powerful man in the world. The nation still needs presidential action. And the Democrats need action too, if they\u2019re going to avoid disaster this fall.\n\nLast week, I asked around for suggestions, things the Obama administration could do, all on its own, that the Republicans in Congress would be powerless to stop. I heard countless good ideas: Obama could make it absolutely clear to his FCC chairman that net neutrality is the policy of his administration; he could reclassify marijuana so that it is no longer a Class 1 narcotic; he could reform the federal contracting system to discourage outsourcing and promote good labor practices; he could encourage whistleblowers rather than punishing them.\n\nThere is also still an opportunity for momentous, headline-making, consensus-shattering deeds. Each of the following three ideas would move the country in the direction Obama has always maintained he wanted to move us\u2014toward accountability, away from inequality, toward a healthy middle class. And each of them is sufficiently big that it might make a difference this fall.\n\nYes, doing these things would require audacity, but that\u2019s why we elected this guy in the first place. These days it\u2019s either show some boldness\u2014some confrontational cleverness\u2014or resign yourself to killing time for the next two years and hoping President Hillary (or President Huckabee) gets better breaks.\n\n1. President Obama should instruct his Attorney General to start enforcing the nation\u2019s antitrust laws the way Democrats used to do.\n\nOnce upon a time, monopoly and oligopoly were illegal in America. Our ancestors believed, correctly, that concentrated economic power was incompatible with democracy in all sorts of ways. (Antitrust expert Barry Lynn and I talked this over for Salon readers a few weeks ago.) Since the days of Ronald Reagan, however, every succeeding administration has chosen to enforce the antitrust laws only if the monopoly or oligopoly in question threatened to cause big price increases for consumers \u2014 and sometimes not even then. This has come to mean that nearly all mergers and takeovers are permitted, and that achieving monopoly has once again become the obvious strategic objective of every would-be business leader.\n\nThe consequences of this policy shift have been huge, both in our everyday economic lives\u2014where we face off against unchallengeable power everywhere from beer to bookselling\u2014and the gradual fraying of society. Unrestrained corporate power naturally yields unrestrained wealth for corporate leaders and their Wall Street backers. In a recent essay in Harper\u2019s Magazine about inequality (once Obama\u2019s favorite subject), the economist Joseph Stiglitz declared monopoly to be one of the main culprits:\n\n\u201cThe most successful \u2018entrepreneurs\u2019 have figured out how to create barriers to competition, behind which they can earn huge profits. It is not a surprise that the world\u2019s richest person, Bill Gates, earned his fortune through a company that has engaged in anticompetitive practices in Europe, America, and Asia. Nor that the world\u2019s second richest, Carlos Slim, made his fortune by taking advantage of a poorly designed privatization process, creating a virtual monopoly in Mexico\u2019s telecom industry. . . .\u201d\n\nBarack Obama could change the entire thing\u2014could bend the inequality curve itself\u2014merely by deciding to enforce the nation\u2019s antitrust laws in the same way that administrations before Reagan did. The laws themselves were written a century ago, so our current, useless Congress would have no say in the matter.\n\nI asked Barry Lynn what this would look like. \u201cThe administration can begin tomorrow to attempt to enforce antitrust law exactly as the Johnson Administration enforced it in 1967,\u201d he wrote me. Obama and Co. would encounter obstacles here and there, of course\u2014the companies singled out by the Justice Department would fight like hell, for example. But there would be little the House of Representatives could do to stop the administration, Lynn says, short of \u201ccutting off funds for enforcement or declaring monopoly legal.\u201d Either of which would, of course, be fatal to the right.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing here,\u201d Lynn concluded, \u201cthat a bit of courage, combined with a bit of smarts, wouldn\u2019t fix.\u201d\n\nFor Obama to launch a FDR-style crusade against economic feudalism would push just about everything short of war off the front pages and would also put the GOP in the uncomfortable position of defending monopoly power. It would also remind voters of the original, more hopeful Obama crusade of 2008, when the Senator from Illinois traveled the country promising to restore competition to agricultural markets\u2014back before he decided to just drop the whole thing.\n\nLastly, a fight against our modern-day octopi might put small-business people, the right\u2019s most motivated constituency these days, back onto the political fence. Antitrust is their issue, after all: let\u2019s see them get out and work their butts off for Boehner when he\u2019s standing tall for the multinational that just drove them out of business.\n\n2. Investigate and prosecute fraud committed during the housing bubble.\n\nThis one would require a little urgency, since we are getting close to the statute of limitations, but it\u2019s the right thing to do\u2014hell, it borders on existential necessity.\n\nNo one cares about the gargantuan civil settlements the Justice Department has been winning from the Wall Street banks. The law enforcement community, for their part, has been content to blame individual homebuyers for the disaster that sank the economy. The leaders of Obama\u2019s justice department, meanwhile, worry themselves sick that prosecuting financiers might damage the banks and the economy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Congress is a mess, but that doesn't mean Obama is powerless.
