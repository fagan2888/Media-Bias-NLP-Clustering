They\u2019re setting the stage for 2017 hikes that could reach well into the double digits, in some cases.\n\nThe HealthCare.gov website, where people can buy health insurance, is displayed on a laptop screen in Washington. Insurers are expected to seek significant premium increases for 2017. 2015 Associated Press File Photo Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192\n\nFor example, in Virginia, a state that reports early, nine insurers returning to the HealthCare.gov marketplace are seeking average premium increases that range from 9.4 percent to 37.1 percent. Those initial estimates filed with the state may change.\n\nIn Maine, Lewiston-based Community Health Options is the largest provider of health insurance under the health law. The nonprofit co-op provides coverage to 84,000 policyholders in Maine and New Hampshire. Harvard Pilgrim Health Care and Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield also provide insurance under the law.\n\nChief Executive Officer Kevin Lewis could not be reached for comment Thursday, but in March he told the Portland Press Herald, \u201cWe have a clear plan for 2016,\u201d and beyond. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say there will be (premium) increases.\u201d\n\nLewis declined to say how much the increase might be, but said Community Health Options will submit its rate proposal to the Maine Bureau of Insurance sometime in mid-May. Premiums increased only about 0.5 percent in 2015, Lewis said.\n\nThe Maine Bureau of Insurance must approve any increase before new rates take effect in January 2017. Eric Cioppa, superintendent of the Maine Bureau of Insurance, could not be reached for comment Thursday night.\n\nAfter a successful first year, when Community Health Options was the only co-op in the country to report a surplus, it ran into trouble with higher than expected claims last year.\n\nIt reported a loss of $31 million in 2015. In December, the Maine Bureau of Insurance intervened and closed down new enrollments while it got its finances in order. The co-op cut $11 million in operating expenses and in reports to the state appears to have met its budget goals.\n\nLOW ENROLLMENT, SICKER CUSTOMERS\n\nMore than 12 million people nationwide get coverage though the health law\u2019s markets, which offer subsidized private insurance. But the increases could also affect several million who purchase individual policies outside the government system.\n\nEntering the program\u2019s fourth year, the health law\u2019s markets are still seeking stability, in contrast to more-established government programs like Medicaid and Medicare Advantage, in which private insurers profitably cover tens of millions of people.\n\nThe health law\u2019s nagging problems center on lower-than-hoped-for enrollment, sicker-than-expected customers, and a balky internal stabilization system that was already scheduled to be pared back next year.\n\nThis year, premiums for a benchmark silver plan rose by a little more than 7 percent on average, according to administration figures. A spike for 2017 would fire up the long-running political debate over the divisive law, which has survived two Supreme Court challenges and a Republican repeal bill, which Obama vetoed.\n\nOf the presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton is the only one promising to build on the Affordable Care Act. She\u2019s proposed an aggressive effort to increase enrollment along with measures to reduce consumer costs. The Republican candidates all want to repeal \u201cObamacare.\u201d Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders would incorporate it into a bigger government-run system covering everyone.\n\nThe health law is \u201clikely in for a significant market correction over the next year or two,\u201d said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cThere have been a lot of signals from insurers that premiums are headed up.\u201d\n\nStandard & Poor\u2019s health insurance analyst Deep Banerjee said he expects premium hikes to be higher for 2017 than in the larger, more stable market for employer coverage. Insurers are facing higher medical costs from health law customers, and some companies priced initial coverage too low in an attempt to grab new business.\n\n\u201cWhat they are doing now is trying to catch up,\u201d said Banerjee.\n\nSUBSIDIES WILL ALSO INCREASE\n\nAetna chairman and CEO Mark Bertolini said Thursday the nation\u2019s third-largest health insurer still sees a good business opportunity, but Congress needs to provide leeway for companies to design lower-cost plans tailored to young, healthy people.\n\n\u201cWe will see the dynamics of the market get tougher as we go forward if we don\u2019t get those kinds of structural changes,\u201d he said. How that would happen in a politically polarized atmosphere, Bertolini did not explain.\n\nAetna lost more than $100 million on its health law business last year but hopes to break even this year.\n\nThe administration says talk of premium increases is premature and overblown. Insurer\u2019s initial requests will be denied in some states, officials say, aided by a rate-review process strengthened under the health law.\n\nMost significantly, more than 8 of 10 customers in the health law\u2019s markets get subsidies to help pay their premiums, and they will increase as premiums rise. Many have also shown they\u2019re willing to shop around for lower-priced coverage.\n\n\u201cMarketplace consumers would do well to put little stock in initial rate filings,\u201d spokesman Ben Wakana said in a statement. \u201cAverages based on proposed premium changes are not a reliable indicator of what typical consumers will actually pay.\u201d\n\nAlso mitigating the pressure for higher premiums is a one-year moratorium \u2013 for 2017 \u2013 on a health law tax on insurers, part of last year\u2019s federal budget deal.\n\nStill, it\u2019s hard to ignore the litany of insurer complaints.\n\nLast month, an analysis of medical claims from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association concluded that insurers gained a sicker, more costly patient population as a result of the law.\n\nRecently, UnitedHealth, the nation\u2019s biggest insurer, said it will pull back from the health law markets, citing estimated losses of $650 million this year, on top of $475 million it lost last year.\n\nMany insurers struggled because they didn\u2019t know how much medical care their new customers would use. Some patients had been out of the health care system for years and had been holding off getting needed care.\n\nInsurers who are more bullish on the program tend to be ones that expanded slowly into the markets and have a lot of experience working with low-income Medicaid recipients.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Maine's largest provider faced higher claims last year, and says rates will rise in 2017.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Maine's largest provider faced higher claims last year, and says rates will rise in 2017.", "title": "Significant premium increases expected under Affordable Care Act - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/857060_Health-Overhaul-Premiums.JP_.jpg", "height": 666}, "updated_time": "2016-04-29T00:09:29-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2016/04/28/significant-premium-increases-expected-under-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Maine's largest provider faced higher claims last year, and says rates will rise in 2017.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/857060_Health-Overhaul-Premiums.JP_.jpg", "title": "Significant premium increases expected under Affordable Care Act - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Health care", "tag": "Affordable Care Act", "published_time": "2016-04-28T17:16:58-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T00:09:29-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In Maine, Lewiston-based Community Health Options is the largest provider of health insurance under the health law.\nThe HealthCare.gov website, where people can buy health insurance, is displayed on a laptop screen in Washington.\nInsurers are expected to seek significant premium increases for 2017.\nThe health law is \u201clikely in for a significant market correction over the next year or two,\u201d said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.\nAetna lost more than $100 million on its health law business last year but hopes to break even this year."}
