From our experience as presenters at the Conference on World Affairs, we regard the CWA as an unparalleled event. It is nothing short of a national treasure and deserving of protection and preservation.

It is our conviction that the CWA should remain an equal partnership between the University of Colorado and Boulder.

As this was not the case in 2015, we have chosen not to participate in the 2016 conference.

We join with the many voices in Colorado and from all over the country in urging CU to seriously consider changing its actions and the CWA leadership.
