The internet is filled with viral failures ranging from unintended tweets to poorly thought out videos. Things can especially spiral out of control with content that prompts interaction with consumers. Take the hashtag as an example. Businesses and individuals will use the hashtag as a call to action. Hashtags encourage others to contribute to social media in a specific way. Unfortunately, this \u201cspecific way\u201d isn\u2019t always the way a business or individual might intend.\n\nThe following is a lift of seven hashtag hijack fails. This list contains examples where companies failed to properly hijack a hashtag, as well as cases where a company\u2019s expensive hashtag was hijacked itself. In all these cases, you are in for a zen like experience. Let the \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d of hashtag hijacking wash over you and bring you clarity.\n\n1. JP Morgan\n\nBack near the end of 2013, JP Morgan decided to work on brand relations with its consumer base with the hashtag \u201c#AskJPM\u201d. The hashtag was meant to create a positive image for the company, but Twitter users quickly hijacked the hashtag to share their own views on the bank. Safe to say, the outcome was on the opposite end of JP\u2019s expectations. Users quickly criticized the bank with little gems such as this one aimed at JPM\u2019s CEO:\n\nWhen Jamie Dimon eats babies are they served rare? I understand anything above medium-rare is considered gauche. #AskJPM \u2014 Eric (@Talking_Monkeys) November 13, 2013\n\nGiven JP Morgan\u2019s troublesome dealings with the US government at the time, maybe this is an example of poetic justice via social media?\n\n2. Ann Coulter\u2019s Own Hijacking Is Hijacked\n\nSometimes, the process of hijacking a hashtag can bring its own degree of idiotic danger. Back in May, conservative pundit Ann Coulter tried to hijack the \u201c#BringBackOurGirls\u201d social media campaign (calling attention to 300 kidnapped Nigerian girls) by posting a picture of herself with the hashtag \u201c#BringBackOurCountry\u201d:\n\nMy hashtag contribution to world affairs \u2026 pic.twitter.com/Wkb8ozYZFC \u2014 Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) May 12, 2014\n\nIn response, various users retweeted her original tweet with the hashtag replaced:\n\nMan, sometimes I\u2019m shocked by the shit @AnnCoulter says for attention. pic.twitter.com/m3QnG2ZJhr \u2014 Atchka! (@atchka) May 12, 2014\n\nAnn Coulter: pic.twitter.com/18m4khBC0a \u2014 abeedledorp (@freddiehamiIton) May 12, 2014\n\nThis really makes you wonder, was this all just a comedic trick on Ms. Coulter\u2019s part? Maybe she\u2019s just a comedic genius?\n\nOkay\u2026 probably not.\n\n3. DiGiornio\n\nLast month, the \u201cit\u2019s not delivery, but it\u2019s still cardboard\u201d pizza giant DiGiornio tried to participate in the trending hashtag \u201c#WhyIStayed\u201d. In Twitter 101, you are usually taught to research the hashtag before posting a tweet using it. At the very least, get a good sense of where the hashtag started. Unfortunately, DiGiornio didn\u2019t bother to do either and sent out a tweet that read \u201c#WhyIStayed You had pizza.\u201d\n\nIf they had bothered to research the hashtag, they would have found that the \u201c#WhyIStayed\u201d hashtag was being used to share stories of domestic abuse. Once DiGiornio discovered their blunder they quickly deleted the tweet and made two apologetic statements.\n\nGiven the general public response to DiGiornio\u2019s apology, it seems like business and sincerity still can mix.\n\n4. Walgreens\n\nSome companies try to be rather discrete when they attempt to promote brand-related love from their consumer base. Other companies, like Walgreens back in 2013, try to make this attempt as blatant as possible. First, Walgreens tried to coax consumer love with the hashtag \u201c#ILoveWalgreens\u201d. Second, the company spent a six figure sum for the hashtag to become a trending topic. Everyone gets a little attention starved every now and then, but really Walgreens?\n\nLike many of the examples, people took the hashtag and bent it to their will. Some individuals outright challenged the company with, \u201cIs it just me, or is this trending tropic #ILoveWalgreens basically worthless if the company bought placement on the trending list?\u201d Others gave into their sarcastic darkside: \u201c#ILoveWalgreens because I prefer to pay $6 for a half-gallon of milk\u201d.\n\nRecommended for You Webcast: Hacking SEO: The Fastest Way to Double Your Rankings in 90 Days\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that this was not money well spent for Walgreens.\n\n5. Qantas\n\nSometimes you need to add an incentive to get people to participate in a hashtag. Australian airline company Qantas tried this method in 2011 after months of union disputes that eventually grounded their entire airline fleet. Qantas offered a pair of pajamas and a \u201cluxury amenity kit\u201d for tweeting good things about the airline.\n\nSo what were some of the notable entries? Well, how about:\n\n\u201c#QantasLuxury- when the passengers arrive before the couriers delivering the lockout notices do\u201d\n\n\u201cGetting from A to B without the plane being grounded or an engine catching fire. #qantasluxury\u201d\n\n\u201c#qantasluxury is chartering a Greyhound bus and arriving at your destination days before your grounded Qantas flight\u201d\n\nI\u2019m going to assume these people weren\u2019t tweeting for the reward pajamas.\n\n6. Obamacare\n\nThe Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) has had a rocky road the past couple of years. There has been a plague of political debate, technical difficulties, and PR blunders. To cut through the mud, the White House tried turning to Twitter in 2013 with the hashtag \u201c#Obamacareisworking\u201d. The response was somewhat predictable considering the debate at the time, but the directness of the criticism is a warm (although less entertaining) change from the sarcastic snark people often turn to first.\n\n@BarackObama Thanks to Obamacare my premium went up 12%. No thanks BO. #Obamacareisworking \u2014 Tio Tom\u00e1s (@TuPadreDice) August 5, 2013\n\nBusinesses are cutting hours and shedding employees because #obamacareisworking \u2014 Brett McManus (@brett_mcmanus) August 5, 2013\n\n7. Tide\n\n2013 was a very popular year for hashtag and hijack failure. Tide joined the list of failed social media campaigns with their promoted hashtag \u201c#cleanwins\u201d as a tie-in to the start of the NFL season. Unlike the other entries in this list, the responses weren\u2019t all in direct opposition to Tide. Some of the responses just didn\u2019t hit the intended mark:\n\nThe one who has clean hands and a pure heart, who does not trust in an idol or swear by a false god. Ps 24:4 #cleanwins \u2014 His Way (@Godinthewhisper) September 5, 2013\n\nIs #CleanWins supposed to be about religion, the Super Bowl, or doing your laundry? I\u2019m confused. \u2014 Abby Nielsen (@absterpoo) September 5, 2013\n\nStill, others were clearly anti-Tide:\n\nBaking soda, vinegar, peroxide & lemon are great ingredients to use instead of conventional cleaning products. #cleanwins \u2014 The S File (@TheSFile) September 5, 2013\n\nOthers still\u2026 well, drugs!\n\nWake n bake time #cleanwins pic.twitter.com/LO32M1e1mN \u2014 kyle randall (@purplesyurp) September 5, 2013\n\nThis concludes our tour of some rather notable hashtag hijack fails.
