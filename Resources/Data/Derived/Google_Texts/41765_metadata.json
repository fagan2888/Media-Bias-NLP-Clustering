The new systemwide agreement between UC and Health Net expands the role of UC Health in a new accountable care arrangement responsible for serving the health care needs of almost half of the UC employees across the state enrolled in Health Net Blue & Gold HMO.\n\nEnhanced Collaboration\n\nTo optimize the performance of the Health Net Blue & Gold HMO, which is the health coverage selected by many UC employees and their eligible family members, Health Net, UC and UC Health have established a new collaboration model.\n\n\u201cTogether, we are committed to a long-term collaboration that continues managing and expanding a portfolio of clinical care initiatives to help enhance the health care experience of Health Net members and help improve affordability,\u201d said Steve Sell, president of Health Net\u2019s Western Region Health Plan.\n\nHealth Net has been at the forefront of developing innovative arrangements that enhance the ability of health care providers to improve quality, affordability, and the overall care experience.\n\n\u201cUC Health is committed to managing its patient population in a way that integrates services across the full spectrum of care, to increase efficiencies in the delivery system and lead to better outcomes and enhanced patient satisfaction,\u201d said John Stobo, M.D., executive vice president for UC Health. \u201cThe expanded accountable care arrangements between Health Net and UC in 2016 will serve UC\u2019s employees, non-Medicare retirees and their covered family members enrolled in the Health Net Blue & Gold HMO who utilize UC Health\u2019s own provider groups and medical centers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe expanded contractual relationship with Health Net provides even more transparency into our health care delivery system for the benefit of our employee population,\u201d Stobo said. \u201cOur arrangement enables us to work as a team with Health Net to develop advanced care models and integrated systems and apply best practices at all five academic medical centers to provide the right care at the right time and in the right place.\u201d\n\n\u201cHealth Net\u2019s existing accountable care arrangement in San Francisco clearly demonstrates the power of collaboration,\u201d said Sell. \u201cDuring its first three years, the San Francisco initiative achieved $25 million in savings by increasing access to care through wider use of urgent care centers, transforming members\u2019 care experience when they were hospitalized, and offering assistance for members and physicians to better manage patients\u2019 medications. Together, these improvements help improve patients\u2019 relationships with their doctors, and the success is due to the collaborative efforts of our provider partners: UCSF Medical Center, Hill Physicians Medical Group and Dignity Health.\u201d\n\n\u201cEver since we implemented our care arrangements in San Francisco in 2013 and Los Angeles in 2015, our goal has been to help improve clinical outcomes and the patient experience while aiming to reduce the health care cost expenditures of our UC members,\u201d said Terri Guzy, Health Net vice president of Strategic Provider Partnerships. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about the expansion to the Davis, Irvine and San Diego campuses, and we look forward to working with the University of California to build upon its clinical expertise as we evolve to the next stage of our innovative arrangements.\u201d\n\nUC Health\u2019s accountable care arrangements are highlights of the Health Net Blue & Gold provider network, which was specifically developed in collaboration with UC. The network contracts with selected physician groups and hospitals in 30 California counties and provides access to employees and non-Medicare retirees of the UC system and their eligible family members.\n\nUC employees and their eligible family members may get more information about the Health Net Blue & Gold HMO at www.healthnet.com/uc.\n\nAbout Health Net\n\nHealth Net, Inc.
