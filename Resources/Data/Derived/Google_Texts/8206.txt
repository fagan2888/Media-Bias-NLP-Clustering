WASHINGTON — Rep. Pete Sessions’ big donors do not appear to be jumping ship to support a challenge from his right.

Just one of tea party activist Katrina Pierson’s 19 largest donors previously donated to Sessions, R-Dallas.

Russell J. Ramsland gave $500 to Sessions’ 2010 re-election effort. He’s given the federal maximum of $2,600 to the Pierson campaign.

“I didn’t leave Pete as much as Pete left me,” Ramsland said. “He’s been very clear to us that he represents [House Speaker] John Boehner; he doesn’t really represent us.”

Ramsland said Sessions abandoned his base by not strongly supporting attempts to defund the Affordable Care Act and not pushing for a special investigation into the 2012 Benghazi attacks. He referred to Sessions as a “big-government guy.”

Sessions has pushed back at such criticism, saying he’s part of a leadership team that has worked to cut federal spending.

As for Pierson, Ramsland said she has a “very solid grounding in the principles of free enterprise and limited government within its constitutional grounds.”

Pierson’s supporters hope her campaign can mirror Sen. Ted Cruz’s tea party-backed defeat of establishment conservative Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst in the 2012 Republican primary. But Cruz had much more financial help, while Pierson trails Sessions badly in fundraising.

Year-end campaign reports showed that Sessions, the chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee, had about $1.3 million on hand, to $50,000 for Pierson.

Pierson is expected to receive an endorsement from a top tea party group, the Tea Party Express, at an event Wednesday.
