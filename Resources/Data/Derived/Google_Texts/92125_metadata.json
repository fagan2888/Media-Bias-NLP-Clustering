So a serving size is about 3-4 ounces so if you can limit your red meat to, about you know, six ounces a week. That would be the recommendation,\" she added.\n\nTippin said other factors cause carcinogens on meat, like the way the meat is cooked. She said it's best to cook on low temperatures so none of the meat gets charred.\n\nTippin also said exposure to processed meat at a young age can increase risk for breast cancer.\n\nFor more information on the WHO study, click here.", "article_metadata": {"ib-analytics": "data", "description": "A World Health Organization study released Monday said processed meat, for example cold cuts or hotdogs, increase the risk for colon and stomach cancer.", "generator": "CoreMedia", "author": "KRCR", "og": {"site_name": "KRCRTV", "description": "A World Health Organization study released Monday said processed meat, for example cold cuts or hotdogs, increase the risk for colon and stomach cancer.", "title": "Dietitian: Moderation key to eating processed and red meats", "url": "http://www.krcrtv.com/living/health/dietitian-moderation-key-to-eating-processed-and-red-meats/36062952", "image": "http://www.krcrtv.com/image/view/-/36063294/highRes/1/-/maxh/640/maxw/640/-/f93523z/-/1280x960-50904P00-HKOXW-jpg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.krcrtv.com/living/health/dietitian-moderation-key-to-eating-processed-and-red-meats/36062952", "site": "@krcr7", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 326090907430922}, "keywords": "Redding health news", "google-site-verification": "gTTyxbmKN17E5sKQVjUGk8TIpxo_XoD5X2_F3PXfucg", "news_keywords": "Redding health news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfbff\"", "article_summary": "She said the study revealed what health officials have said all along, red meat and processed meat can be healthy in moderation.\nTippin also said exposure to processed meat at a young age can increase risk for breast cancer.\nThe study said processed meat, for example cold cuts or hotdogs, increase the risk for colon and stomach cancer.\nSo a serving size is about 3-4 ounces so if you can limit your red meat to, about you know, six ounces a week.\nREDDING, Calif. -Local registered dietitian and nutrition professor at Shasta College, Joanne Tippin, said the study released by the World Health Organization that says processed and red meats can cause cancer is valid."}
