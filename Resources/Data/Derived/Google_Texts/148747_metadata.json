Paul LePage.\n\nLast week in the Senate, the bill fell two votes short of a veto-proof margin.\n\nAdditional Photos Rep.

It also would establish a managed-care system for the entire MaineCare program.\n\nMaineCare now serves about 320,000 low-income people, including the elderly, the disabled, working parents and their children.\n\nDemocrats, who have made Medicaid expansion a policy priority, have emphasized the human impact of not extending coverage to more poor Mainers. Republicans continue to stress the future costs of expanding the $2.5 billion program, which accounts for about 17 percent of state spending.\n\nAlthough the expansion bill appears doomed, the political rhetoric has escalated. Last week, Democrats said that if Maine does not expand Medicaid, it will increase the likelihood that more than 150 low-income Mainers with chronic illnesses will die. Republicans accused Democrats of calling them murderers.\n\nRep. Deborah Sanderson, R-Chelsea, said Tuesday that it \u201cboggles the mind\u201d that anyone would consider expansion, given MaineCare\u2019s effect on state budgets.\n\n\u201cIf we expand Medicaid, we will experience a fiscal tsunami,\u201d she said.\n\nDemocrats who spoke during Tuesday\u2019s floor debate cited the number of people who would gain health care coverage and the fiscal impact in their respective counties.\n\nRep. Jeff McCabe, D-Skowhegan, the assistant House majority leader, said the bill is about \u201cmercy and help.\u201d He said Republicans are under significant pressure to reject expansion, but he encouraged them to think about the impact on their constituents.\n\nRep. Matthew Pouliot, R-Augusta, was one of the conflicted Republicans. He said that pressure came from both parties, and that Democrats unfairly portrayed Republicans as not caring about poor people. He said he was disturbed by the partisan nature of the debate.\n\n\u201cI would never compromise on the truth for the sake of getting along with people who only get along when we agree,\u201d he said.\n\nPouliot voted to support the bill, but said the real health care solution won\u2019t come until the cost of care decreases.\n\nA provision in the Affordable Care Act makes individuals whose earnings are above the federal poverty level \u2013 about $11,670 per year \u2013 eligible for subsidies to buy private insurance for as little as about $5 per week. Republicans have said they don\u2019t support the Affordable Care Act, but prefer that low-income Mainers have \u201csome skin in the game,\u201d rather than getting free coverage through Medicaid.\n\nDemocrats have countered that 36,000 people would fall into a coverage gap because they\u2019re below the poverty level and don\u2019t qualify for subsidized insurance. And advocates for the poor say the private insurance option is still unaffordable because of high deductibles and out-of-pocket costs.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act assumed that anyone below 110 percent of the poverty level would be covered by expanded Medicaid programs in their states.\n\nThe fight over expansion is expected to play into this year\u2019s legislative and gubernatorial campaigns, as it has in the 21 other states that have not expanded Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act. The federal law originally mandated that all states expand their Medicaid programs, but the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that the mandate was unconstitutional and that expansion is optional for states.\n\nHospitals have been heavily engaged in the debate in state legislatures, including Maine\u2019s, since the court ruling. The expansion was designed in part to offset an estimated $155 billion in Medicare reimbursement cuts to health care providers, including hospitals. The Maine Hospital Association estimates that the Medicare cuts will cause an $870 million loss to the state\u2019s hospitals through 2020.\n\nWith Medicaid expansion now in doubt, so is the prospect that Maine hospitals will receive any benefit from coverage for people who now receive free \u201ccharity care.\u201d\n\nThe bill that representatives debated Tuesday, L.D. 1487, was sponsored by moderate Republican Sens. Roger Katz of Augusta and Thomas Saviello of Wilton, who tried to draft a compromise to draw Republican votes.\n\nThe compromise includes a provision to end expanded coverage after three years of full federal reimbursement unless the Legislature reauthorizes it. It also includes studies to evaluate the cost and health impacts of expansion, and to explore the feasibility of using federal money to help uninsured Mainers buy private insurance.\n\nThe main component of the bill would install a managed-care system to reduce costs. Democrats viewed that provision as a major concession, but it has failed to persuade enough Republicans to support the bill.\n\nIn the Senate last week, the bill got one less vote than an expansion bill that was passed by lawmakers and vetoed by LePage last year.\n\nRep. Heather Sirocki, R-Scarborough, said the managed-care provision would add complexity to an already complex bill. She said its promise of \u201cfancy new cost savings\u201d is a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d that hides the future obligations of Medicaid.\n\nSteve Mistler can be contacted at 791-6345 or at:\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: @stevemistler", "article_metadata": {"description": "The vote to pass a compromise plan is 97-49, but it\u2019s not enough to override a LePage veto, the same as in the Senate.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "The vote to pass a compromise plan is 97-49, but it\u2019s not enough to override a LePage veto, the same as in the Senate.", "title": "In Maine House, Medicaid expansion passes easily, but still falls short - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/20140319_996936.xml-20140318+Medicaid+2.jpg", "height": 690}, "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/03/18/maine_house_advances_medicaid_expansion_bill__but_republican_support_still_lacking_/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The vote to pass a compromise plan is 97-49, but it\u2019s not enough to override a LePage veto, the same as in the Senate.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/20140319_996936.xml-20140318+Medicaid+2.jpg", "title": "In Maine House, Medicaid expansion passes easily, but still falls short - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Local & State", "tag": "state", "published_time": "2014-03-18T13:26:07-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Democrats, who have made Medicaid expansion a policy priority, have emphasized the human impact of not extending coverage to more poor Mainers.\nIn the Senate last week, the bill got one less vote than an expansion bill that was passed by lawmakers and vetoed by LePage last year.\nAlthough the expansion bill appears doomed, the political rhetoric has escalated.\n\u201cIf we expand Medicaid, we will experience a fiscal tsunami,\u201d she said.\nDemocrats who spoke during Tuesday\u2019s floor debate cited the number of people who would gain health care coverage and the fiscal impact in their respective counties."}
