The interest is such that they could one day outpace the public exchanges created through the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a third of employers looking into private exchanges going forward. I think that says a lot,\u201d said Ben Isgur, director of the Health Research Institute of PwC. \u201cTwenty-four months ago, I don\u2019t think there was hardly anyone talking about private exchanges.\u201d\n\nAccording to the consulting firm Accenture, more than 40 million residents will enroll in a plan through a private exchange by 2018, surpassing projected enrollment in state and federal exchanges. As of June, the firm found 3 million employees received insurance through a private exchange, a trend of \u201chyper growth\u201d that outpaced the company\u2019s own expectations. In comparison, about 8 million have received insurance through public exchanges.\n\nPrivate marketplaces will likely develop in the long-term rather than the short-term growth seen in their public counterparts: \u201cWhile the ACA\u2019s public marketplaces are expected to see rapid early growth, the shift to retail-style private exchanges may be more of a steady trickle,\u201d the report reads.\n\nMoving employees to marketplaces allows for more stable premiums across the board. Typically, the employer will offer a set amount to employees for coverage they can purchase on the private exchanges. From there, employees will often have more choices to tailor the plans: Do you want a high deductible with lower premiums? A narrow network? A plan that establishes a health savings account?\n\nThe nature of the private exchanges, Isgur says, prompts more customer engagement. They\u2019re true marketplaces, offering comparison shopping for products that meet different needs or wants. In order to get the most out of them\u2014and save the most money\u2014employees will need to be more involved in their own care.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the learning curve will be as pronounced as, say, someone who signed up on a public exchange,\u201d says Steve Love, president of the Dallas-Fort Worth Hospital Council. \u201cMany of those people have never had any type of insurance before whereas these people have had insurance, they\u2019re just migrating.\u201d\n\nThe trend is gaining support among some large companies: Walgreen Inc. has guided its 160,000 employees to private exchanges while Safeway Inc. did the same with its 135,000.\n\nThe PwC report quotes Tom Sondergold, the senior director of Walgreen\u2019s Health and Well-Being, who says that the private exchanges mean he no longer has to manage administrative tasks such as plan design. He can focus more on providing health incentives for employees. It also stabilizes premiums for its employees nationwide.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still the plan sponsor, but administration is off my back,\u201d he\u2019s quoted as saying. \u201cPlan design is off my back. I can focus now on well-being and strategy.\u201d\n\nThe benefit for smaller and mid-sized companies, PwC found, is that it offers more choices than it would be able to otherwise. It also puts the onus of consumer support and online benefit sites squarely on that of the insurer. Companies with 50 or fewer employees can have them use the public exchanges. Nevertheless, education, Isgur says, will be more important going forward.\n\n\u201cEmployers are really going to have to double down on education,\u201d he says. \u201cThe employee now has to think about the deductible, their co-pay. They have to think more about who\u2019s in network and who\u2019s out of network, they think about the tradeoff between paying more for a premium and having a wider network or less from a premium and a more narrow network. All of them require a huge amount of employee education.\u201d\n\nThe hope is that a more informed population would emerge as a result of this trend. Employees will have to weigh whether a $5,000 deductible is affordable should an emergency happen. Or, if suffering from back pain, would a chiropractor would be a better option than an X-Ray? And if an X-Ray is necessary, how much does each provider charge?\n\n\u201cThe more you can inform people to where they make informed decisions about their healthcare and it\u2019s more transparent to them and they feel that they\u2019re empowered in that decision making, well, that\u2019s clearly a good thing,\u201d Love says.\n\nHowever, the report notes a \u201cparadigm shift in how Americans purchase health coverage is underway.\u201d The interest is indicative of what\u2019s to come\u2014it\u2019s not here yet. Some employers are jumping in while others are waiting to see if it works, Isgur says.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a stage of interest and evaluation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a few first movers who have already moved into the private exchange model \u2026 but we\u2019re seeing a lot of wait-and-see. First and foremost, people are trying to evaluate whether it\u2019s going to lower costs.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "D Healthcare Daily", "description": "More employers are joining the growing choir of interest in pushing full-time staffers to private healthcare exchanges, eager to find an option that drops costs and gets employees more engaged in their own care.
