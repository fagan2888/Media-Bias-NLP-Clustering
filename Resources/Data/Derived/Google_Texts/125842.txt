It’s like having the Man of Steel’s X-ray vision — the amazing helmet that gives an F-35 fighter pilot the power to “see through” the plane.

According to The Washington Post, each advanced, custom-made helmet costs more than $400,000 — a price tag befitting the most expensive weapons program in U.S. history: the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike fighter.

“The F-35 Lightning II is one of the most complicated weapons systems ever developed, a sleek and stealthy fighter jet years in the making that is often called a flying computer because of its more than 8 million lines of code.”

Part of the sky-high budget for building each of the super-advanced fighters goes toward technology that enables the pilot to have an expansive view as though he were flying outside the aircraft.

“Embedded in the skin of the aircraft are six cameras, and when the pilots move their heads to look in a particular direction, they are actually seeing through the corresponding camera, which sends an image to projectors inside the helmet that beam an image of the outside world on the helmet’s visor.”

The article in The Post notes that the third iteration of the “Superman” helmet is currently being tested, with pilots checking out a new night vision camera among other improvements.
