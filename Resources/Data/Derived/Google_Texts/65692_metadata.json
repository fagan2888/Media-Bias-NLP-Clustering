Now, additional recent readers' views.\n\n1. \"Imagine if the Westboro Baptist Church happened to own Arlington.\" From Noboru Akimoto:\n\nI've been watching your back and forth on Yasukuni with some interest, and I generally agree with the commentators that say the issue is more with the Yushukan than with the shrine itself. [JF note: Yushukan is the \"historical\" museum near the shrine, with a very tendentious view of Japan being forced into the war by Allied encirclement.]\n\n\n\nI do think a part that's not been mentioned is that Yasukuni Jinja [Shrine], because of the separation of religion and state of the post-war constitution, is NOT a part of the Japanese government, nor does any of the Imperial family have control over its actions. We know from the Tomita Memorandum that the Showa Emperor [aka Hirohito] was furious about the chief priest's decision to include the Class A 14 into the shrine in 1979, but that as a matter of politics, neither the Emperor nor the government can actually compel Yasukuni, a private religious institution, from acknowledging the 14 Class A criminals nor force it to disinter their spirits. As a Japanese individual and Shintoist, I would like to see the priests separate the class A war criminals from the others, but I also understand that as a practical, constitutional matter, having the government force the issue would be a step in the wrong direction. If we had to have some sort of strange analogy, I would ask American readers to imagine if the Westboro Baptist Church happened to own Arlington. Also, I've put up a short primer on the subject.\n\n2. By the way, who are these \"Class-A War Criminals\" anyway? From a reader in Singapore, with a point I should have clarified earlier:\n\nIn your recent posts about the Yasukuni shrine, the inclusion of WWII era Japanese Class-A war criminals is mentioned with no explanation of the term \"Class-A\". I've noticed that this is common in news articles about Yasukuni in recent decades, though in your article you do note that the war criminal trials in Japan held by the Allies were at least somewhat controversial as to their basis in law and morality. It is almost natural for the casual reader (or writer of articles) to assume that \"Class-A\" in this context simply means the worst kind of war criminal, a sort of Japanese equivalent of an Adolf Eichmann, Heinrich Himmler, Amon Goeth or some such. As you likely know, \"Class-A War Criminal\" had a very specific meaning in the context of the Tokyo trials. \"Class-A\" war crimes were defined as \"crimes against peace\". Crimes against humanity, such as genocide or the Nanking massacre were \"Class-C\" crimes while the more usual war crimes, such as shooting helpless prisoners, were \"Class-B\" war crimes. The 25 Japanese officials tried for Class-A war crimes were tried for plotting and waging war, i.e. crimes against peace. Some of them were tried additionally for Class-B and Class-C crimes, and all those multiply convicted were executed. But at least two of those charged with Class-A crimes resumed civilian life, in the Japanese cabinet in the 1950s and as the CEO of Nissan, respectively. In 1929, Japan signed (but did not ratify) the Kellogg-Briand Pact formally titled the \"General Treaty for the Renunciation of War as an Instrument of National Policy\". The treaty made declaration of aggressive war illegal, but not prosecutable by other signatories to the treaty. \"Declaration\" was the weasel word in the treaty, which many nations, including Japan took full advantage of in the years to come. And it was on this basis that the Class-A charges were prosecuted in the 1946 Tokyo trials. Except for the Imperial Family and the Showa Emperor, Hirohito, who were protected by Douglas MacArthur, this meant that practically the entire Japanese cabinet that had anything to do with the conduct of war was thus indicted. I think it would help if a brief note were made in the article about the terminology. I'm not suggesting moral or legal exoneration of these individuals but context matters. The term \"Class-A\" plays straight into the hands of the Chinese Government which has its own questionable agenda in kicking up a protest about Yasukuni every year. I would have thought that it is the inclusion of the Class-C criminals that would be more morally disturbing to non-Japanese victims of the war, though in the case of China and Korea at least, the Buddhist value commonplace in Japan, of letting go of the grudge against the sinner (not the sin) after his death, is not exactly unknown or alien. Quite the opposite.\n\n3) An American equivalent? From a reader on the West Coast:\n\nIn \u201cEpisode Six\u201d your \u201cAmerican who lives in Japan\u2026and has a Japanese spouse\u201d observed that \"The museum (Yushukan) is shocking in its mendacity (in its willingness to change or omit events entirely) and audacity \u2026 I struggle to think of a comparable hypothetical for US history - if the Vietnam memorial in Washington also had an exhibit attached that lauded the use of napalm and the actions at My Lai?\u201d In fact, the same sort of mendacity and audacity did almost occur at the Vietnam Memorial. Then President Ronald Reagan, his Interior Secretary James Watt and their supporters were adamantly opposed to Maya Lin\u2019s design for the memorial, precisely because it did not glorify an unjust lost war while memorializing the soldiers who fought it. After Lin won the competition and it became apparent they could do nothing to stop it, opponents of her design tried to have a much more mundane, representational sculpture (\u201cThe Three Soldiers\u201d) placed at the apex of the memorial. While The Three Soldiers neither lauds the use of napalm nor glorifies My Lai, those opposed to Lin\u2019s Wall knew full well that placing the statue at the apex would reduce her design to mere backdrop, negating it\u2019s abstract emotional power and timelessness. If not for the courage of Maya Lin (then a 21 year old Yale undergraduate) The Wall would indeed have become mere background to one more forgettable representative sculpture lost in the expanse of the National Mall . One could argue that was the objective of the right-wing opponents of the Vietnam memorial all along. While recognizing the left is just as capable as the right at papering over history we should avoid false equivalency here. One regrettable quality of the right wing mind seems to be the unique skill it brings to the revision of history, the negation of fact and the power of forgetfulness. Unfortunately this is every bit as true here in America as it is in Japan.\n\nI well remember that the controversy over the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was bitter and intense. As it happens, I think the final outcome is the right one -- artistically, historically, culturally. Maya Lin's wall endures as a real work of genius, and it regularly has a larger crowd of up-close visitors than any other site on the Mall. Usually families or friends looking at names of loved ones. (You can contrast this with the stupid, ugly vapidity of the recent World War II memorial, a subject for another time.) The addition of Frederick Hart's \"The Three Soldiers\" statue, nearby but not surmounting the wall, I think adds to rather than complicates the commemorative power of the memorial. The more recent addition of a realistic statue of combat nurses also is, in my view, a dignified plus.\n\n4) Self-identity as victim. From an American who recently visited Japan:\n\nLast year, when we visited the moving Atomic Bomb museum in Nagasaki, I was surprised to find that the timeline on the wall gave the name, \"War of the Pacific\", to WWII and explicitly blamed the U.S. for the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which was shown only by a single photo on the wall. Apparently, the Yasukuni representation is not isolated.\n\nI had the same impression on my first visit to the Peace Memorial Museum in Hiroshima back in the 1980s. Its historical account began with something like, \"In the springtime of 1945, the U.S. Army Air Corps launched a campaign of firebombing against major cities in Japan...\" with no mention of what might have happened beforehand.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The complications of wartime memory, continued", "author": "James Fallows", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The complications of wartime memory, continued", "title": "What Is a 'Class-A War Criminal'?
