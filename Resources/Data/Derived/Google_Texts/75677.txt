Joni Ernst: Scarier than she wants you to know about.

Joni Ernst: Scarier than she wants you to know about.

Why, oh why, has Joni Ernst been hiding from the Iowa press, refusing to do endorsement meetings with editorial boards and in-depth interviews with local television news? What topics that might come up in such interviews could the Republican Senate candidate possibly be avoiding?

Hmmm ...

Could those be some reasons for Ernst to avoid serious scrutiny from Iowa newspapers? And that's not even getting into her support of personhood legislation or the handgun she thinks will defend her against the government or the time she said President Obama "has become a dictator." Ernst's election chances hinge on seeming like a down-to-earth soldier-mom next door, and that means keeping voters from finding out about her extreme positions. So it's no wonder she's apparently decided that close scrutiny by local media would be a bad idea.

(Side question: Why has Ernst been doing interviews with national media at the same time she's been ducking Iowa outlets?)
