A more than five-hour barricade situation in Weld County ended with law enforcement deploying tear gas and one man in custody Friday night, officials said.

The Weld County Sheriff’s Office responded to the 3500 block of 35th Avenue in Greeley on an assault in progress, according to a county sheriff’s office news release.

Officers were told that Edwin Velez-Agosto, 28, was chasing someone with a knife.

When law enforcement arrived on scene, Velez-Agosto barricaded himself inside his home and “refused to come out,” the release said.

The Weld County SWAT team was dispatched, and Velez-Agosto eventually came out of his residence once tear gas was deployed inside the home. Velez-Agosto was taken into custody around 10:30 p.m.

Velez-Agosto was taken to North Colorado Medical Center for treatment and then transported to the Weld County Jail where he is being held on charges of felony menacing.
