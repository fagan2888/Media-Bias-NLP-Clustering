(Museum of Palaeontology Egidio Feruglio) Museum of Palaeontology Egidio Feruglio Museum of Palaeontology Egidio Feruglio\n\nResearchers believe they've found fossils of a dinosaur so large that it would have made Tyrannosaurus rex look like a pipsqueak.\n\nResearchers announced this week they found fossils of a sauropod dinosaur that they estimate was the largest creature to have ever walked the earth.\n\nDr. Ruben Cueno, director of Museo Paleontol\u00f3gico Egidio Feruglio in Trelew, Argentina, said the dinosaur would have weighed at least 77 tons and grown to triple the size of a T. Rex. The bones were initially discovered by a farmer who spotted something unusual coming out of the ground.\n\n\u201cIt looked like a bone, but it was absolutely different from the bones [he recognized like] horse, llamas and sheep,\u201d Cuneo told ABC News.\n\nWhen the farmer alerted local scientists, they started digging and discovered a treasure trove of fossils. Cuneo said there are bones for seven dinosaurs, each the height of a seven-story building and stretching 120 feet from nose to tail.\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s] a major, major beast that has been discovered for the first time in Patagonia,\u201d said Cuneo. \u201cIt was an amazing discovery.\u201d\n\nAlthough scientists have been digging for years, Cuneo told ABC News he expects the dig to take at least two more years before all the bones are removed. Some bones will remain on site for the winter, covered by special plaster. Other early findings have already been brought back to the museum, where a new wing will be created solely to display the new dinosaur species.\n\nThe dinosaur does not yet have a name, but Cuneo said since names often refer to a geographic area or a researcher, it\u2019s possible that the dinosaur will reflect where it was found.\n\n\u201cSuper Patagoniasauraus,\u201d Cueno said was one option. \u201c[This] is going to be a major attraction in coming years.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Researchers announced this week they found fossils of a sauropod dinosaur that they estimate was the largest creature to have ever walked the earth.", "language": "english", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/news/scitech/headlines/Farmer-finds-fossils-of-largest-dinosaur-ever-to-walk-the-earth-259668331.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/HT_MEF_argentina_dinosaur_fossil_2_jt_140517_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Researchers announced this week they found fossils of a sauropod dinosaur that they estimate was the largest creature to have ever walked the earth.", "title": "Farmer finds fossils of largest dinosaur ever to walk the earth"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Researchers announced this week they found fossils of a sauropod dinosaur that they estimate was the largest creature to have ever walked the earth.", "title": "Farmer finds fossils of largest dinosaur ever to walk the earth", "url": "http://www.kake.com/news/scitech/headlines/Farmer-finds-fossils-of-largest-dinosaur-ever-to-walk-the-earth-259668331.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/HT_MEF_argentina_dinosaur_fossil_2_jt_140517_16x9_992.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Farmer finds fossils of largest dinosaur ever to walk the earth", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Farmer finds fossils of largest, dinosaur ever to walk the"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd116\"", "article_summary": "(Museum of Palaeontology Egidio Feruglio) Museum of Palaeontology Egidio Feruglio Museum of Palaeontology Egidio FeruglioResearchers believe they've found fossils of a dinosaur so large that it would have made Tyrannosaurus rex look like a pipsqueak.\nResearchers with the Museum of Palaeontology Egidio Feruglio found fossils of a dinosaur they believe was the largest creature to have ever walked the earth.\nResearchers announced this week they found fossils of a sauropod dinosaur that they estimate was the largest creature to have ever walked the earth.\n\u201c[It\u2019s] a major, major beast that has been discovered for the first time in Patagonia,\u201d said Cuneo.\nWhen the farmer alerted local scientists, they started digging and discovered a treasure trove of fossils."}
