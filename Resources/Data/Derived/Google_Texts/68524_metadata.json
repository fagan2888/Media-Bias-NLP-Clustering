The Rams rallied in the second half to beat the Bulldogs 34-31. ( GARY KAZANJIAN / The Associated Press )\n\nFRESNO, Calif. \u2014 Colorado State was supposed to be the team with something to play for Saturday night. Lucky for the Rams, Joe Hansley was around to remind them.\n\nThe senior scored three touchdowns on the night \u2014 the first two on punt returns \u2014 first giving Colorado State hope, then the lead in a xx-xx victory at Bulldog Stadium.\n\nIt gives Colorado State (7-5, 5-3 Mountain West) four straight wins to end the regular season, guaranteeing first-year head coach Mike Bobo a winning season as the Rams head to a bowl game to be determined. Fresno State (3-9, 2-6) is done for the year, with reports both coordinators are soon to be out of work.\n\nBut early on for the Rams were stagnant on offense and grasping at air on defense. Fresno State rolled out to a 24-7 lead late in the first half behind rushing touchdowns by three different players. CSU had rushed for negative-2 yards in the first quarter, while the Bulldogs were marching down the field behind the efforts of quarterback Kilton Anderson and running back Marteze Waller.\n\nHansley gave the Rams an early lead with his 75-yard punt return after Fresno State's first possession.\n\nFresno State then scored 24 straight points heading into halftime, getting a 33-yard field goal from Kody Kroening, followed by scoring runs by Anderson (18), linebacker Ejiro Ederaine (1) and Dustin Garrison (11).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust before half, Hansley struck again, breaking off a 61-yard punt return for a score to cut the lead to 24-14 at half.\n\nCSU's special teams continued their magic out of the break as Kevin Nutt opened the half with a 96-yard kickoff return, making CSU the first team in the past 10 seasons to have three kick returns for a score in a game.\n\nColorado State's running game started to gain steam in the second half, leading to a pair of scoring drives. True freshman Izzy Matthews, who finished with 140 yards, broke free for a 39-yard touchdown run to put Colorado State back in the lead, but only for a short spell. But after a 2-yard scoring run by Waller put the host back in front, Hansley struck again, catching a 24-yard pass from Nick Stevens with 10:03 remaining, his sixth touchdown catch of the season.\n\nStevens struggled much of the night, hitting just 11 of his 21 throws for 85 yards, also throwing an interception that was returned 34 yards by Tyquwan Glass 34 yards to set Ederaine's score. But for the fourth straight week, the Rams were able to get the running game going, finishing with 260 yards on the night. Taking the ball with 5:03 remaining in the contest, the Rams were able to run at will to salt away the win.\n\nMike Brohard: 970-635-3633, mbrohard@reporter-herald.com and twitter.com/mbrohard", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/ci_29178037/colorado-state-senior-hansley-guy-have-around", "modificationDate": "2015-11-28T22:50:24-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/1128/20151128__29rhscsufbw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Mike Brohard \n \n  Sports Editor", "description": "FRESNO, Calif. \u2014 Colorado State was supposed to be the team with something to play for Saturday night.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:29178037:view"}, "startDate": "2015-11-28T22:49:16-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/ci_29178037/colorado-state-senior-hansley-guy-have-around", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/1128/20151128__29rhscsufbw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "FRESNO, Calif. \u2014 Colorado State was supposed to be the team with something to play for Saturday night.", "title": "Colorado State senior a Hansley guy to have around"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "FRESNO, Calif. \u2014 Colorado State was supposed to be the team with something to play for Saturday night.", "title": "Colorado State senior a Hansley guy to have around", "url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/ci_29178037/colorado-state-senior-hansley-guy-have-around", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/1128/20151128__29rhscsufbw~1.jpg", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-11-28T22:49:16-0700", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "endDate": "2025-11-28T22:49:16-0700", "sailthru.title": "Colorado State senior a Hansley guy to have around", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Sports", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "byline": "By Mike BrohardSports", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/1128/20151128__29rhscsufbw~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-11-28T22:52:32-0700", "news_keywords": "Sports, Sports news, Loveland Colorado Sports news, Loveland Colorado news, Sports Loveland news, Sports Colorado news, US Sports news, world Sports news."}, "article_summary": "Fresno State (3-9, 2-6) is done for the year, with reports both coordinators are soon to be out of work.\n( GARY KAZANJIAN / The Associated Press )FRESNO, Calif. \u2014 Colorado State was supposed to be the team with something to play for Saturday night.\nSenior scores three TDs to pace Rams to winColorado State's Daylin Dawkins hits a crease against Fresno State during Saturday night's game.\nThe senior scored three touchdowns on the night \u2014 the first two on punt returns \u2014 first giving Colorado State hope, then the lead in a xx-xx victory at Bulldog Stadium.\nFresno State rolled out to a 24-7 lead late in the first half behind rushing touchdowns by three different players."}
