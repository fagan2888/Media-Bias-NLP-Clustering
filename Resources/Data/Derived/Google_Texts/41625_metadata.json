A Harvard poll found that when asked, \u201cHow often do you trust the president to do the right thing,\u201d just 32 percent of young voters said \u201call the time.\u201d That same number was 51 percent four years ago.\n\nMany believe that the sinking numbers represent a lost opportunity on the part of President Obama.\n\n\u201cObama had a moment, we all had a moment, between 2007 and the 2010 mid-term elections, to engage the largest generation in U.S. history, and we didn\u2019t do it,\u201d said Harvard pollster John Della Volpe in an interview with the National Journal.\n\nObama has suffered from other problems common in voters across the spectrum, including a difficult roll-out for his trademark Obamacare program. His administration has also seen scandals in the Benghazi attack and cover-up, the IRS harassment of Conservative groups, Fast and Furious, NSA spying on American citizens, and the deadly problems with the VA system.\n\nWhile he has difficulty among young people, President Obama has actually seen some approval ratings increase overall. In a recently released Zogby poll, he gained four points among both women and voters over 65, hitting an overall approval rating of 47 percent.\n\nThe small improvement comes after President Obama saw his approval rating fall to new lows just weeks before. In late April, a Washington Post/ABC News poll found that his approval dipped to just 41 percent, the lowest at any point during his presidency.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama saw his approval rating sink among what was once his strongest group, with young people growing upset with unfulfilled expectations from", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "President Barack Obama saw his approval rating sink among what was once his strongest group, with young people growing upset with unfulfilled expectations from", "title": "President Obama Approval Ratings Sink Among Young Voters", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1266895/president-obama-approval-ratings-sink-among-young-voters/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/President-Obama-Approval.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-25T14:38:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-25T19:36:32+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/President-Obama-Approval.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-05-25T14:38:17+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "barack obama,obama approval rating,president obama,politics", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/President-Obama-Approval.jpg", "width": 670, "height": 409}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "President Barack Obama saw his approval rating sink among what was once his strongest group, with young people growing upset with unfulfilled expectations from"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb1f8\"", "article_summary": "The small improvement comes after President Obama saw his approval rating fall to new lows just weeks before.\nWhile he has difficulty among young people, President Obama has actually seen some approval ratings increase overall.\nMany believe that the sinking numbers represent a lost opportunity on the part of President Obama.\nIn a recently released Zogby poll, he gained four points among both women and voters over 65, hitting an overall approval rating of 47 percent.\nObama has suffered from other problems common in voters across the spectrum, including a difficult roll-out for his trademark Obamacare program."}
