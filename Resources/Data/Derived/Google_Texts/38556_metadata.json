POLITICO Pro IRS service degraded, taxpayers to pay price\n\nMany taxpayers face being abandoned this tax season by an IRS grappling with budget woes, according to a watchdog report released Wednesday.\n\nNational Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson\u2019s several-hundred page annual report to Congress paints a daunting picture of an agency deteriorating to \u201cunprecedented\u201d poor service levels that are \u201cgetting worse.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cAs the nation\u2019s advocate for taxpayers, I feel compelled to speak up about the degradation of service provided by the IRS in all aspects of its work, primarily in its pre-filing and filing activities but also in its enforcement activities,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe report card is sure to make IRS Commissioner John Koskinen squirm. While the agency chief has warned time and time again that service would crumble as Congress slashes the agency budget, Olson questioned IRS decisions on what to cut, suggesting reductions elsewhere would have been less harmful to the taxpayer.\n\nShe also blasted the IRS for failing to put in place measures that hold employees accountable, recommending for example that managers approve tax liens and that IRS employees be required to put their names and contact information on audits.\n\nCongress has shaved the IRS budget 17 percent since fiscal 2010 when adjusted for inflation, all while the agency is dealing with more returns than ever before. Each year it fields phone calls from about 100 million people. They\u2019re also now implementing Obamacare.\n\nKoskinen for months has warned that the expanded mandate and budget cuts, a GOP priority, would cripple the agency\u2019s ability to do its job, warning on Tuesday that half of taxpayers won\u2019t be able to get through on the phone during this tax season \u2014 and only after waiting half an hour.\n\nIn 2004, the IRS answered 87 percent of calls after having people on hold for an average of only 2.5 minutes.\n\nTwo of Olson\u2019s big recommendations \u2014 more funding and congressional oversight \u2014 are likely to fall on deaf ears in the GOP-controlled Congress. The IRS still has a black eye over the tea party targeting controversy, but Olson said the agency still needs funds to serve taxpayers.\n\n\u201cEveryone is in collective denial about what inadequate funding for the IRS means to taxpayers,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile the Olson report will give Republicans plenty of ammunition against their least favorite agency, she also criticized them.\n\nIt may seem ironic she calls for more oversight \u2014 Congress held dozens of lengthy hearings to grill IRS officials amid the tea party saga. But she said lawmakers are hyper-fixated on the most headline-grabbing issues, to the detriment of others.\n\nHer suggestion: Focus \u201cnot just on the issue du jour but on all the routine work the IRS does.\u201d\n\n\u201cBipartisan, dispassionate congressional hearings on these issues \u2026 would help create a framework for what the IRS needs and how it should operate in order to gain the trust of U.S. taxpayers,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNow more than ever, congressional involvement is needed to repair the damage and place tax administration on a better path forward.\u201d\n\nShe also asks lawmakers not to scapegoat the agency as a whole for the actions of a few: \u201c[C]asting the entire agency and its employees as an out-of-control agency in response to the actions of a few, no matter how deplorable those actions may be, is harmful to taxpayers and to tax compliance.\u201d\n\nWhile she thinks the IRS can operate more efficiently, \u201cthe only way the IRS can assist the tens of millions [of] taxpayers seeking to speak with an IRS employee is to have enough employees to answer their calls,\u201d she said.\n\nShe blasted the agency\u2019s recent decision to stop answering \u201ccomplex\u201d tax law questions on the phone and at walk-in centers. The IRS is training employees to only answer \u201cbasic\u201d tax questions and directing taxpayers to the IRS website if the question goes beyond that.\n\nAnd after tax season ends, employees are being told to not answer any tax law questions \u2014 despite the fact that 15 million taxpayers obtain filing extensions or file later in the year, Olson said.\n\nThat\u2019s a huge decrease in taxpayer assistance, she said, citing a GAO study showing tax law questions answered by taxpayer assistance centers fell 86 percent from 2004 to 2013, with the sites answering 110,000 inquiries, down from 795,000. In 2004, the sites answered almost 600,000 questions outside of tax season; now they\u2019ll answer none.\n\n\u201cWe think it is a sad state of affairs when the government writes tax laws as complex as ours \u2014 and then is unable to answer any questions beyond \u2018basic\u2019 ones from baffled citizens who are doing their best to comply,\u201d Olson said.\n\nOlson says it will cause the agency more harm in the long run: \u201cTaxpayers will be unable to talk with IRS employees about making payment arrangements, resulting in automated and unnecessary liens and levies and leading to expensive downstream activities like levy releases and lien releases and withdrawals.\u201d\n\nShe also chided the agency for its decision last year to discontinue the longtime practice of helping hundreds of thousands of low income, elderly and disabled taxpayers prepare their tax returns at IRS walk-in sites.\n\n\u201cAll too often, the message the government is sending to U.S. taxpayers doing their best to comply with the law is, \u2018We\u2019re sorry. You\u2019re on your own,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nJoining with the GAO and Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, Olson questioned how the IRS came to decisions to cut these services, arguing the agency \u201clacks a clear rationale for taxpayer service budgetary allocation decisions.\u201d\n\nShe said her office is trying to work with the IRS to create a ranking of taxpayer service activities most needed by taxpayers but is facing \u201climitations imposed by the lack of available data have delayed implementation.\u201d\n\nThe lack of taxpayer service goes against taxpayer rights reforms Congress enacted in the 1990s and 1980s, which the IRS has \u201cresisted,\u201d Olson said.\n\nThe result is that taxpayers aren\u2019t getting the help they deserve, she said.\n\nFor example, the IRS\u2019s offshore voluntary disclosure program of taxpayers who came forward to admit they may have avoided taxes, \u201cstill violates taxpayer rights,\u201d she says. The IRS in 2014 \u201cstreamlined\u201d the program after critics said it was actually punishing small count taxpayer more for unreported taxes than those who evaded large swaths of taxes intentionally.\n\nIRS now allows so-called benign actors to pay smaller penalty, but \u201cthe IRS will not allow those with signed closing agreements to benefit from the most recent changes, thereby punishing taxpayer who came in early.\u201d\n\nAnother taxpayer rights proposal IRS has overlooked, she said: A 1998 congressional mandate to assign a specific employee to examination cases so taxpayers have a point of contact inside the IRS, and a old congressional requirement that IRS employees put their names, phone numbers and employee IDs on audits, for accountability.\n\nShe\u2019s also recommending managerial approval for tax liens for overdue taxes to ensure people don\u2019t get treated unfairly.\n\nAnd she\u2019s asking Congress to give social welfare groups and other tax-exempt entities the ability to seek declaratory judgments from courts to resolve disputes about their tax exempt status. Currently only charities, 501(c)(3)s, can do so if the IRS denies their application, fails to answer it 270 days after the application is filed or if their exempt stats is revoked.\n\nHer top legislative priority, a Taxpayer Bill of Rights, would fix many of these problems, she said.\n\nThe House passed such a bill last Congress but the Senate never acted on it, and though the IRS adopted it on its own in the spring of 2014, Olson says it should be codified because the agency isn\u2019t living up to the standards currently.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The annual report describes a rapidly deteriorating agency.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The annual report describes a rapidly deteriorating agency.", "title": "IRS service degraded, taxpayers to pay price", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/irs-service-degraded-taxpayers-to-pay-price-114257.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/12/19/koskinen_irs_ap_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "Taxes,IRS", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/rachael.bade.9"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "POLITICO Pro IRS service degraded, taxpayers to pay priceMany taxpayers face being abandoned this tax season by an IRS grappling with budget woes, according to a watchdog report released Wednesday.\nThe IRS is training employees to only answer \u201cbasic\u201d tax questions and directing taxpayers to the IRS website if the question goes beyond that.\n\u201cEveryone is in collective denial about what inadequate funding for the IRS means to taxpayers,\u201d she said.\nThe IRS still has a black eye over the tea party targeting controversy, but Olson said the agency still needs funds to serve taxpayers.\nShe also blasted the IRS for failing to put in place measures that hold employees accountable, recommending for example that managers approve tax liens and that IRS employees be required to put their names and contact information on audits."}
