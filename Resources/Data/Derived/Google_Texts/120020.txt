Je suis Tom Brady!

Je suis Bill Belichick!

As you must know by now -- and if you don't know then you're probably dead so perfume yourself -- the New England Patriots and their quarterback Brady and coach Belichick have been accused of an incredibly cynical crime:

But that's just about freedom, how we're governed and the future of a republic that allows tax breaks so NFL owners can build stadiums and feed the sports media lousy chili.

Perhaps he has tiny hands and requires a soft ball to get a better grip. Or it could be that Brady's fingers have weakened with age.

Je suis Tom! Je suis Bill!

"Je n'aime pas les balles degonfles!"

The French might even join us, to show we're friends, and French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius might bring Gallic musical entertainment, perhaps 90-year-old Charles Aznavour opening for French rappers IAM or Supreme NTM.

And after all this hype about what Brady and Belichick did with the balls, you know what's going to happen, don't you?

They'll serve up a head.

Or rather, the Brady-hating sports media will be given a head, and they might as well stick it up on the walls of ESPN, kind of like what they did to the honorable Ned Stark on "Game of Thrones"

But the head of some nondescript ball boy for the New England Patriots.

Only weeks ago, the NFL story involved running backs either knocking their fiancees out with one punch or whipping their children with sticks. And now we're consumed by deflated balls.
