Tuesday she spent six hours with her new agent at her family\u2019s dining room table in Centennial, discussing career goals. Wednesday she went shopping at Park Meadows, looking for shoes to match a dress for a gala in Nashville on Saturday where she would be honored as one of Ten Outstanding Young Americans.\n\nThat last task might have been the toughest in Missy Franklin\u2019s first week as a professional swimmer. Finding the perfect shoes in a size 12 can be an ordeal.\n\n\u201cShoe shopping for me is always a mess,\u201d Franklin said during a shopping break. \u201cBy the grace of God, I found the perfect pair of shoes, which never happens, so I am extremely happy.\u201d\n\nShe also was enjoying the afterglow that came from leading California to an NCAA championship last weekend in her final meet as an amateur. The win was especially emotional because the Golden Bears finished third last year.\n\n\u201cWe were really disappointed with how we did last year,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cWe made a decision as a team, almost immediately when we got home, that we could be better and we were going to be better.\n\n\u201cThe feeling of walking over to your team, hugging everyone, knowing you just accomplished what you\u2019ve been working so hard for, for 10 months, it\u2019s just unbelievable.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s something Franklin will miss as a professional. She loved being part of teams at Cal and Regis Jesuit High School. The races at the 2012 London Olympics that meant the most to her were relays.\n\n\u201cWinning really doesn\u2019t mean anything if you have no one to share it with,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to mean anything unless you have those people who will be so excited for you, who\u2019ve supported you and you know they\u2019ve had a piece in that. When I\u2019m on a national championship team, a high school state championship team, a gold medal-winning relay, I get to do it with people I love, with people I care about. Sharing in that joy and that success and that love, that is incredibly fulfilling to me.\n\n\u201cObviously I get a huge sense of fulfillment and happiness when it\u2019s individual as well, but for me, it\u2019s even more special and it\u2019s really amplified when I get to share it with other people.\u201d\n\nNow she is on the WME-IMG team, led by agent Mark Ervin, who also represents skier Lindsey Vonn.\n\n\u201cHe understands my main goal in my career is to inspire people,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cI need a platform to inspire, and that\u2019s what I think being a professional athlete is going to give me: being able to reach more people, getting myself out there so I can share my story, so I can share other people\u2019s stories who have inspired me. I\u2019m so looking forward to that and what\u2019s going to come.\u201d\n\nSo are her parents, Richard and DA.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be fun,\u201d Richard said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fun for us because we can get out of the agency business and just be Mom and Dad.\u201d\n\nThis week Missy returns to Cal to finish a semester that ends in May. With the world championships looming in August and her second Olympics a year after that, in Rio, Franklin plans to reduce her class schedule. She never has had the luxury of preparing for major events without carrying a full class load.\n\nShe is determined to get her degree, but doesn\u2019t plan to carry a full course load until the spring of 2017.\n\nFranklin hasn\u2019t decided whether to find a new coach or remain with Cal\u2019s Teri McKeever. One problem is that she will be training and racing all over the world, but McKeever\u2019s focus has to be on her college coaching.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a bit of an unknown,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cI have incredible options, and I still need to sit down with Teri. We need to have a really long talk.\u201d\n\nTurning 20 in May, Franklin figures to have three more Olympics and has begun to talk about the possibility of becoming the most decorated female Olympic swimmer of all time. She has five medals now (four gold). Jenny Thompson, Dara Torres and Natalie Coughlin are tied for the most (12).\n\n\u201cOne of the things Teri taught me is that it\u2019s OK to say what your dreams and goals are,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cI think it would be amazing to be the most decorated female Olympic swimmer of all time. That\u2019s a huge goal, that\u2019s unbelievably lofty, and I have incredible women before me who have set the bar so high. I may reach it, I may not, but either way I\u2019m going to fight for it. That\u2019s the exciting part.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Missy Franklin ready to make a big splash as pro", "title": "Missy Franklin ready to make a big splash as pro", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/28/missy-franklin-ready-to-make-a-big-splash-as-pro/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150328__20150329_C13_SP29OLYMISSY1p1.jpg", "height": 497}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150328__20150329_C13_SP29OLYMISSY1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-28T19:56:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T16:58:42+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Missy Franklin"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc97da\"", "article_summary": "\u201cShoe shopping for me is always a mess,\u201d Franklin said during a shopping break.\nThat last task might have been the toughest in Missy Franklin\u2019s first week as a professional swimmer.\n\u201cWinning really doesn\u2019t mean anything if you have no one to share it with,\u201d Franklin said.\nThat\u2019s a huge goal, that\u2019s unbelievably lofty, and I have incredible women before me who have set the bar so high.\n\u201cOne of the things Teri taught me is that it\u2019s OK to say what your dreams and goals are,\u201d Franklin said."}
