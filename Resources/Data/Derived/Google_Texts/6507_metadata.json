The five-year survival rate for that group is about 12 percent.\n\n\"Of the patients I see on a weekly basis, probably 30 or 40 percent could benefit from palliative care or hospice services,\" he said. \"But fewer than 10 percent of them are involved in that until the very end.\"\n\nKaplan almost always has to explain palliative care: \"We try to explain that it's an active treatment but one that is symptom directed.\" The idea is to reduce suffering, he said.\n\nSoon after a diagnosis, palliative chemotherapy can control the growth of a cancer tumor \u2014 and may reduce distressing symptoms \u2014 but is not an attempt to cure the patient.\n\nThe VA system does not have the rule, but Kaplan said in some states, patients who've decided to enter hospice are not permitted to also have palliative chemotherapy because it is considered an active treatment.\n\n\"From a policy perspective, that's something that can be legislatively addressed,\" he said.\n\nIn more advanced cases, palliative care is provided under the umbrella of hospice \u2014 including pain relief, emotional support, grief counseling for spouses, or respite for overwhelmed caregivers.\n\nPatients often refuse hospice care until the last days of life, Kaplan said, because they perceive that choice as giving up. \"Veterans in particular look at it as surrendering,\" he said.\n\n\"Once one mentions the 'H' word -\u2013 hospice \u2014 in many patients, it creates a wall between the patient and the provider,\" Kaplan said. \"There is a very strong negative cultural bias against palliative care and hospice.\"\n\nThe forum for lawmakers and community members was an attempt to change the conversation.\n\nKaplan said, in his experience, families and patients are very satisfied with hospice and palliative care.\n\n\"They almost universally say I wish we had chosen to do this months ago,\" he added.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Palliative care is often associated with hospice \u2014 or end of life \u2014 but the advocacy arm of the American Cancer Society wants to change the conversation to make it clear that palliative services", "title": "At Philly forum, health experts seek legislative help to expand access to palliative care", "og": {"image": "http://www.newsworks.org/nw_logo_fb.png", "site_name": "Newsworks.org", "description": "Palliative care is often associated with hospice \u2014 or end of life \u2014 but the advocacy arm of the American Cancer Society wants to change the conversation to make it clear that palliative..."}, "twitter": {"description": "Palliative care is often associated with hospice \u2014 or end of life \u2014 but the advocacy arm of the American Cancer Society wants to change the conversation to make it clear that palliative...", "title": "At Philly forum, health experts seek legislative help to expand access to palliative care", "image": "http://www.newsworks.org/images/stories/flexicontent/m_nwnhvabuildingx1200.jpg", "creator": "@taunyaenglish", "site": "@NewsWorksWHYY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffc40d", "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2014-10-17", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"page_id": 115829381793481}, "url": "http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/the-latest/74066-at-philly-forum-health-experts-seek-legislative-help-to-expand-access-to-palliative-care", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "author": "Taunya English", "keywords": "palliative, hospice, patients, cancer, kaplan, often, treatment, philadelphia, there, percent, psychologist, members, network, patient, pracilio, families, liver, because, medical, center", "google-site-verification": "zlKVThgI_7CsCilHyAeJraRojXxR5nL5CZqBEZJMJNw", "st": {"image": "http://www.newsworks.org/images/stories/flexicontent/m_nwnhvabuildingx1200.jpg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc98b0\"", "article_summary": "Pracilio said palliative care often helps patients manage stress or tamp down pain so they can better \"be there for their families.\"\nPatients often refuse hospice care until the last days of life, Kaplan said, because they perceive that choice as giving up.\nKaplan said, in his experience, families and patients are very satisfied with hospice and palliative care.\n\"There is a very strong negative cultural bias against palliative care and hospice.\"\n\"Of the patients I see on a weekly basis, probably 30 or 40 percent could benefit from palliative care or hospice services,\" he said."}
