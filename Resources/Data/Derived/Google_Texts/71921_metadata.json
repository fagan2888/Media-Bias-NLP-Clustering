Jerry Brown has now put his stamp on a minimum wage hike that will likely take away as much opportunity as it provides.\n\nA pragmatist and fiscal prude, Brown jumped into the minimum wage debate and wrung from union advocates concessions that would not have been included in two proposed ballot measures.\n\nWhat California does get is a phased-in $15 per hour minimum wage, with built in deferrals in case of a recession or stock market meltdown that causes state revenue to fall. Under the agreement, the minimum wage would rise from $10 to $10.50 in 2017, $11 in 2018 and then another dollar each year through 2022.\n\nBut the governor\u2019s deal with the left-leaning legislative leadership will have deeply negative impacts on smaller business, on young professionals and on those at the very bottom of the employment ladder. It would have been much smarter if he\u2019d held out for indexing future minimum wage hikes to inflation beginning now instead of more than half-a-decade in the future.\n\nThat\u2019s because while Gov. Brown and the legislature get the right to suspend these pay hikes in the event of a recession, small businesses don\u2019t get the right to plead hardship. And small businesses have plenty to worry about when considering that baseline wages for most will be going up 50 percent. Businesses with fewer than 25 employees get one extra year.\n\nToday, very few small businesses have the ability to raise prices at all \u2013 many will be facing declining prices, particularly if they sell products online. My guess is that as the minimum wage takes hold and the gap between California and other states widens, small businesses will begin to move elsewhere as they start to grow, especially past the 25-employee mark.\n\nThese will not be high-profile departures like CKE Restaurants, which is moving from Carpinteria to Nashville. Instead it will be small companies that elect to grow in other states.\n\nWhen it comes to young workers, the problem is that as the minimum wage steps up so does the minimum salary requirement for exempt workers. Set by law at two times the minimum wage, it recently jumped from below $40,000 to around $43,000. When the minimum wage hikes are done, that translates to a $62,400 in order for workers to be exempt from overtime rules.\n\nWhat happens as the level for exempt pay rises is that more and more professional employees lose their exempt status, have to fill out time cards and are consigned to what amounts to second-class status in most professional organizations.\n\nThey will lose the opportunity to become fully engaged as managers, participate in those after-hours activities that are key to advancement and learn important middle management skills. The disruption will spread to the nonprofit sector, where mid-rank and even senior staffers don\u2019t often make $62,400.\n\nFinally, we come to the very lowest paid workers. They will be heavily disrupted by automation, which will be speeded up by the rising cost of labor.\n\nIn fast food, perhaps in agribusiness and anywhere they can, employers will replace low-wage workers with robots and machines who won\u2019t require benefits, payroll taxes or a guaranteed 50 percent pay hike.\n\nAs mandatory minimum wages roll on, some will get laid off while others will be scheduled for part-time work so that their Obamacare-mandated health benefits don\u2019t kick in.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I think that minimum wage laws are a good idea. They were particularly good ideas in the 1970s when prices were rising much faster than wages and employers were able to quickly pass price hikes along.\n\nThose days have vanished into the rear view mirror and in the absence of some inflationary pressure, a long-term \u201ccommand and control\u201d style series of minimum wage hikes will have terrific unintended consequences. A better solution would be a linking of minimum wage hikes to inflation before putting a $15 per hour wage on the books, but that\u2019s too smart an idea for the political class.\n\nI\u2019m sure that Gov. Brown made a careful political calculation and decided that the smart play was to head off a ballot initiative and wring minor concessions to claim victory.\n\nBut for many small companies and nonprofits, young workers, low-skilled workers and their families trying to eke out a living in a time of near-zero price inflation, this is going to hurt. And California will be hollowing out many of its mid-rank companies, leaving behind only giants and smaller companies which break apart every time they approach the 25-worker threshold.\n\n\u2022 Reach Editor Henry Dubroff at [email protected]", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "dubroff,california,brown,minimum wage,cke,carpinteria,fast food,fast-food,columns,latest news", "og": {"site_name": "Pacific Coast Business Times", "description": "Having pushed through one of the largest tax increases in California history, Gov.
