But the kick was low, and Patrick Gamble managed to get a hand on it.\n\nWhile most of the Georgia Tech players celebrated, Austin went back to retrieve the ball, rolling along inside the 25-yard line.\n\nAt first, he seemed hesitant to pick it up. But then he did, taking off the other way in front of the Georgia Tech bench. He avoided Aguayo\u2019s diving attempt, then cut back on the final guy who had a shot at him to win the game for Georgia Tech (3-5, 1-4).", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Georgia Tech beats Florida State on 78-yard return on final play", "title": "Georgia Tech beats Florida State on 78-yard return on final play", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/24/georgia-tech-beats-florida-state-on-78-yard-return-on-final-play/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151024__Georgia-Techp1.jpg", "height": 437}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151024__Georgia-Techp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-24T20:40:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T11:57:05+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "While most of the Georgia Tech players celebrated, Austin went back to retrieve the ball, rolling along inside the 25-yard line.\nBut then he did, taking off the other way in front of the Georgia Tech bench.\nATLANTA \u2014 Lance Austin returned a blocked field goal 78 yards for a touchdown on the final play of the game, giving Georgia Tech a stunning 22-16 upset of No.\nHe avoided Aguayo\u2019s diving attempt, then cut back on the final guy who had a shot at him to win the game for Georgia Tech (3-5, 1-4).\nRoberto Aguayo, one of the most accurate kickers in the country, attempted a 56-yard field goal to win the game for the Seminoles (6-1, 4-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) with 6 seconds remaining."}
