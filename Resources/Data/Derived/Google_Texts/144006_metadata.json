Ted Cruz argued Tuesday at a Senate hearing that did double duty as a platform to critique the administration and to amplify his own campaign themes.\n\n\u201cFighting for economic opportunity is why I ran for office,\u201d Cruz said after the hearing, citing his \u201copportunity conservative\u201d philosophy that focuses on \u201ceasing the means of ascent up the economic ladder.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is exactly why I am running for president, to get back to the booming economic growth we saw in the 1980s that lifted millions out of poverty and into prosperity,\u201d he said.\n\nCruz, on a break from presidential campaigning, chaired the hearing of the Senate Judiciary\u2019s oversight subcommittee.\n\nSen. Chris Coons of Delaware, the panel\u2019s senior Democrat, called the premise of the hearing \u2013 that overregulation harms minorities\u2013 \u201chighly dubious.\u201d\n\nHe and three witnesses invited by his side argued that regulations have bolstered workplace safety, protected minorities from predatory lenders, discrimination in elections and housing, and improved public health. Rules meant to minimize the risk of chemical and other disasters disproportionately affect minorities, who are more likely to live in or near industrial areas, they said.\n\nOne of Cruz\u2019s favorite punching bags, the Affordable Care Act, has cut the rate of uninsured Hispanics by about 27 percent, Coons noted.\n\n\u201cRegulations have been crucial\u201d to protecting minority communities, insisted Amit Narang, an advocate from Public Citizen.\n\nCruz was not swayed. Nor was Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, the only other GOP senator to attend the 2-hour hearing.\n\n\u201cThe federal government is not the last answer to everything and in many ways it\u2019s the impediment in our society,\u201d Hatch said.\n\nCruz has been pushing \u201copportunity conservatism\u201d since late 2012, after his election and before he\u2019d been sworn in as a senator.\n\nIn critiquing the GOP\u2019s drubbing that fall \u2013 aside from his own soaring victory and a few others around the country \u2013 Cruz saw far too much emphasis on the desires of the wealthy and powerful at the expense of striving, less well-off Americans, many of them black and Hispanic.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a growing sense among many that our nation is in decline,\u201d he said in his opening remarks Tuesday.\n\nHe pointed to stagnant household income and slow job growth since the 2008 crash. More businesses fail each year than are born, a \u201cdeeply troubling trend\u201d that he blamed on overregulation and an \u201cinvasive and bloated government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey seemingly regulate everything under the sun,\u201d Cruz said. Federal regulation has exploded in the last half-century, he said, from 20,000 pages to 175,000, \u201call in incredibly small print\u201d that no individual could possibly understand.\n\nWitnesses included Sabina Loving, a black woman from Chicago who tangled with the IRS over her tax preparation business, after the agency began requiring licensing that would have driven up her costs. CPAs and attorneys were exempt. The rule helped tamp down competition facing big tax-preparation chains.\n\n\u201cI sued the IRS over its anti-competitive licensing scheme,\u201d Loving said. \u201cThankfully we won.\u201d\n\nHarry Alford, president of the National Black Chamber of Commerce, denounced new EPA new rules on greenhouse gas emissions, arguing the rules would drive up costs for electricity, hitting poor families especially hard.\n\nTighter standards will shut down construction, development and, therefore, employment and economic opportunity, he said.\n\nCruz agreed. \u201cOverregulation is stifling opportunity for people who want to achieve the American dream,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Aaron Mair, president of the Sierra Club, asserted that foes of EPA live in \u201can alternative universe\u201d in which corporate polluters use \u201cpropaganda\u201d to persuade vulnerable low-income Americans to oppose anti-pollution efforts.\n\nHe and Cruz tangled repeatedly, including a tense and prolonged exchange over climate change.\n\nMair seemed ill-prepared for the cool interrogation Cruz walked him into.\n\nThe senator often points to satellite evidence showing no planetary warming in the last 18 years, using that to raise doubts about the overwhelming scientific consensus that the climate is undergoing dangerous changes. But Mair seemed unfamiliar with that line of argument, and time and again leaned back from his chair to consult with an aide.\n\n\u201cThe science is settled,\u201d Mair said, citing a survey finding consensus among climate scientists, with only 3 percent of them dissenting. \u201cIt\u2019s been refuted long ago and it\u2019s not up for scientific debate.\u201d\n\nCruz called the study \u201cbogus\u201d and demanded to know whether the Sierra Club would abandon its views on climate change if confronted with solid evidence. Mair kept sidestepping the question,\n\n\u201cYou can cherry pick whatever data you wish,\u201d he said.\n\nAfterward, Cruz called it \u201castonishing\u201d to hear the head of the Sierra Club defend EPA regulations based on pseudo-science. And while the hearing may not have changed minds of those on hand, it was a chance to highlight the human cost of overregulation, he said.\n\n\u201cNo doubt there were witnesses who had a political agenda to defend any and all government regulations,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8xMC90ZWQtY3J1ei1oYW1tZXJzLW92ZXJyZWd1bGF0aW9uLXRhbmdsZXMtd2l0aC1zaWVycmEtY2x1Yi1jaGllZi1vdmVyLWNsaW1hdGUtc2NpZW5jZS5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Todd J.
