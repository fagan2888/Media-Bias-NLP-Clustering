Burwell, a lawsuit that originated in conservative and libertarian think tanks, alleges that a stray phrase in the Affordable Care Act -- \u201can exchange established by the state\u201d -- means the federal government isn\u2019t allowed to provide subsidies to the residents of states that refused to establish health insurance exchanges under the law.\n\nOnly 13 states and the District of Columbia have their own exchanges. If this bid to derail the Affordable Care Act succeeds, the subsidies would disappear -- maybe immediately, maybe a little later -- for Obamacare enrollees everywhere else.\n\nBehind the numbers, however, is a very human story. Without the subsidies, health insurance costs would spike beyond the means of low- and moderate-income recipients. As a result, close to 10 million people would lose their health coverage. Many others would face major increases in the premiums they pay for insurance.\n\nThe Huffington Post interviewed six Americans at risk of the worst effects of a high court ruling against Obamacare. We wanted to know how the law has affected their lives already, and how the absence of subsidies might affect them in the future. They told stories of life and death, financial ruin, lifelong plans in jeopardy and families disrupted. Here are those stories, as told by the people who would be living them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare is back before the Supreme Court in a case that could gut the he...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-03-04 06:00:19 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Obamacare is back before the Supreme Court in a case that could gut the he...", "title": "Obamacare Is Back At The Supreme Court, And These 6 Lives Hang In The Balance", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/03/obamacare-subsidies-supreme-court_n_6784688.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2673692/images/o-ENTRY-PIC-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obamacare is back before the Supreme Court in a case that could gut the he...", "creator": "JeffYoung", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2673692/images/o-ENTRY-PIC-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Obamacare Is Back At The Supreme Court, And These 6 Lives Hang In The Balance", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-03-03 06:00:19 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=6784688", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "health care,health care reform,obamacare,Supreme Court,obamacare supreme court,obamacare lawsuit,Obamacare subsidies", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "health care,health care reform,obamacare,Supreme Court,obamacare supreme court,obamacare lawsuit,Obamacare subsidies", "published_time": "2015-03-03 06:00:19 -0500", "modified_time": "2015-03-03 14:59:02 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc506\"", "article_summary": "O bamacare is back before the Supreme Court in a case that could gut the health care law and leave millions of Americans facing severe consequences.\nWithout the subsidies, health insurance costs would spike beyond the means of low- and moderate-income recipients.\nThe Huffington Post interviewed six Americans at risk of the worst effects of a high court ruling against Obamacare.\nIf this bid to derail the Affordable Care Act succeeds, the subsidies would disappear -- maybe immediately, maybe a little later -- for Obamacare enrollees everywhere else.\nWe wanted to know how the law has affected their lives already, and how the absence of subsidies might affect them in the future."}
