As a consequence, more consumers are complaining even as some excluded providers are suing health insurers. For pathologists and clinical laboratory managers, this accelerating trend of excluding providers means increasingly restricted access to patients.\n\nHealth Insurers Walk a Fine Line between Cost and Access\n\nMany health plans currently sold on the new state insurance exchanges offer substantially smaller networks of providers than was typical in recent years, according to a story published in Modern Healthcare. The payers say narrower networks are necessary for two reasons.\n\nFirst, narrow networks can keep premiums affordable. Second, health insurers say narrow networks help them address the requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nHealth Insurer Networks Must Meet Adequacy Requirements\n\n\u201cThese networks had to meet adequacy requirements that were in place before, and then expanded by the ACA,\u201d wrote the authors of a recent report by McKinsey & Company. \u201c[T]hese requirements include the minimum number and types of providers, and the maximum driving distance and wait time, to ensure that patients have adequate access to care.\u201d\n\nNarrow Networks Mean Lower Premiums and May Impact Access to Care\n\nNarrow networks are a reality of the new health insurance landscape, according to another Modern Healthcare story. In its report, McKinsey categorized the new exchange plans networks as follows:\n\nBroad networks have more than 70% of all hospitals in the rating area participating.\n\nNarrow networks have 31 to 70% of all hospitals in the rating area participating.\n\nUltra-narrow networks have 30% or less of all hospitals in the rating area participating.\n\nNearly half of all insurance plans sold on the public exchanges in 2014 were narrow network plans, the McKinsey report stated.\n\nPrestigious Hospitals Offering Specialty Care Are Sometimes Excluded\n\nLast year, physician groups, hospitals, and patient advocates expressed concern that some patients may not have adequate access to care, Modern Healthcare reported. Other concerns included coordination of care, risk-selection problems, and disruption of physician-patient relationships. Some even argue that disruptions in care could actually increase costs. For example, switching providers could mean that patients undergo duplicative exams and medical laboratory tests.\n\nIn October, Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital filed suit against the state of Washington\u2019s Office of the Insurance Commissioner (OIC). A number of the exchange plans offered in the state excluded Seattle Children\u2019s from their networks. The suit claimed that the OIC failed to ensure adequate network coverage in several of the state\u2019s exchange plans.\n\n\u2018Dire Situation\u2019 for Some Patients\n\n\u201cThis is a dire situation for our patients.\u201d stated Sandy Melzer, M.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer at Seattle Children\u2019s, in a hospital press release. \u201cThe notion that a major insurance plan is going to exclude us from their network is truly precedent-setting and represents a new level of degradation in children\u2019s access to care,\u201d added Melzer in a story 87 published by the Seattle Times.\n\nIn fact, health insurers could try to save money by covering so few doctors that patients can\u2019t get the care they need, one reporter wrote in a story in the New York Times.\n\nAfter Purchasing Plans, Consumers Remain Unclear About Networks\n\nIn its April consumer survey, McKinsey reported that 26% of respondents who had enrolled in an ACA plan were unaware of the network type they had selected. Similar claims arose in the Seattle Children\u2019s case. \u201cFamilies were confused about their new benefits,\u201d stated Melzer in the Seattle Children\u2019s press release. Many didn\u2019t know that Seattle Children\u2019s is not included in their network.\u201d\n\nIn California, consumers recently filed a class-action suit against Anthem Blue Cross, according to Modern Healthcare. The suit alleges that the insurer misled millions of individuals about whether their doctors and hospitals were covered by exchange plans.\n\nElection Year Jitters Could Yield Legislation to Expand Networks\n\nNarrow networks may be here to stay, but there will likely be some tweaking going forward. Some experts agree that health insurers and providers need to do a better job of providing consumers with accessible, easily understandable information about networks when they shop for coverage, noted Modern Healthcare. Further, both federal regulators and state lawmakers are looking for ways to get insurers to expand their provider networks. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) signaled it will increase scrutiny of provider networks.\n\nMeanwhile, pathologists and clinical laboratory managers will want to remain alert to developments regarding exchange plan networks. Congressional Democrats are concerned that narrowing networks could turn into an election issue by election day.\n\nThus, it could be political forces led by congressional Democrats that result in some type of legislation or regulation that causes health insurers to expand their provider networks. If that were to happen, it would benefit local medical laboratories that are typically excluded from many payer networks.\n\n\u2014Pamela Scherer McLeod\n\nRelated Information:\n\nObamacare\u2019s narrow networks are going to make people furious\u2014but they might control costs\n\nLeft off many networks, Seattle Children\u2019s sues\n\nSeattle Children\u2019s Hospital Treats 125 Patients in January Who Lost Contracted Access Through Washington\u2019s Health Benefit Exchange\n\nLess cost, lower premiums\n\nPressure builds over narrow networks\n\nProviders, insurers grapple with narrow-network backlash\n\nHospital networks: Updated national view of configurations on the exchanges\n\nA Health Trade-Off That\u2019s Here to Stay: Lower Cost, Limited Choice", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "pathology, clinical laboratory, medical laboratory, narrow networks, modern healthcare, patient protection and affordable care act, aca, mckinsey & company, sandy melzer, the new york times, the seattle times, seattle children\u2019s hospital, aetna, mark bertolini, washington\u2019s office of the insurance commissioner, oic, anthem blue cross california, health insurance network, centers for medicare and medicaid services, cms aca,aca,aetna,anthem blue cross california,centers for medicare and medicaid services,clinical laboratory,cms aca,health insurance network,mark bertolini,mckinsey & company,medical laboratory,modern healthcare,narrow networks,oic,patient protection and affordable care act,sandy melzer,seattle children\u2019s hospital,the new york times,the seattle times,washington\u2019s office of the insurance commissioner,compliance, legal, and malpractice,laboratory instruments & laboratory equipment,laboratory management and operations,laboratory news", "description": "Insurers are increasingly using narrow networks as a business strategy to control costs.
