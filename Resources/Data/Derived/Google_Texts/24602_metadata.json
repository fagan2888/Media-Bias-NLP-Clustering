If the plaintiffs win, it would not allow them to restrict employees from buying these products on their own, only that the employees would not get them for free.\n\nThe high court will hear the case from two family-owned companies, the Oklahoma-based chain Hobby Lobby and the Pennsylvania-based Conestoga Wood Specialties Store Corp., both of which argue that paying for employee-based coverage of these drug violates their religious freedom.\n\n\u201cToday, there are people trying to take this right away from women, by letting private, for-profit corporations and employers make medical decisions for their employees, based on their personal beliefs,\u201d said Jarrett, whose blog was cross-posted on the Huffington Post.\n\nJarrett predicted victory in the high court, and called out just one of the plaintiffs.\n\n\u201cAmong the first cases to reach the Supreme Court is one filed by Hobby Lobby, an arts and crafts chain whose owners want to be able to take the option for birth control benefits away from their employees,\u201d Jarrett said.\n\nThe two litigants in the case are not trying to restrict anyone\u2019s freedom, said Sarah Torre, policy analyst for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.\n\n\u201cThis is an interesting argument from the administration that pushed a health care law that severely restrictions the ability for Americans to choose health care that aligns with the value of their family and restricting companies that could be creating jobs,\u201d Torre told TheBlaze. \u201cObamacare is about restricting choices.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one is suggesting a ban on anything,\u201d Torre continued. \u201cThis is about family businesses \u2013 the Green family and the Hahns family \u2013 about their freedom to continue to create jobs while respecting their values.\u201d\n\nThe Green family is the owner of Hobby Lobby. The Hahns family owns Conestoga Wood. Lower courts split on the decision, ruling in favor of the Green family and against the Hahns family.\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett called out Hobby Lobby and insisted the Obamacare mandate case that will go before the Supreme Court is about whether big corporations can restrict women from having access to birth control.    \u201cNo corporate entity should be in position to limit...", "creator": "@FredLucasWH", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/11/27/valerie-jarrett-targets-hobby-lobby-as-a-corporate-entity-trying-to-seize-a-controlling-interest-over-womens-health/", "image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/453x6001.jpg", "title": "Valerie Jarrett Targets Hobby Lobby as a \u2018Corporate Entity\u2019 Trying to \u2018Seize a Controlling Interest\u2019 Over Women\u2019s Health", "site": "@theblaze", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512944287}, "keywords": "valerie, jarrett, slams, hobby, lobby, after, supreme, court, accepts, obamacare, case", "sailthru.tags": "business, faith, government, health, obamacare, religious-freedom, valerie-jarrett, author-fred-lucas, site-theblazecom", "facebook-count": 17769, "gplus-count": 9, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282b2d", "sailthru.guid": "theblazecom/714842", "categories": "obamacare,religious-freedom,valerie-jarrett,business,faith,government,health", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/medium150x150.png", "comment-count": 387, "description": "White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett called out Hobby Lobby and insisted the Obamacare mandate case that will go before the Supreme Court is about whether big corporations can restrict women from having access to birth control.    \u201cNo corporate entity should be in position to limit...", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/wide310x150.png", "linkedin-count": 1, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/small70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/large310x310.png", "fb": {"admins": 517831498}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theblaze.com/", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"site_name": "The Blaze", "description": "White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett called out Hobby Lobby and insisted the Obamacare mandate case that will go before the Supreme Court is about whether big corporations can restrict women from having access to birth control.    \u201cNo corporate entity should be in position to limit...", "title": "Valerie Jarrett Targets Hobby Lobby as a \u2018Corporate Entity\u2019 Trying to \u2018Seize a Controlling Interest\u2019 Over Women\u2019s Health", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/11/27/valerie-jarrett-targets-hobby-lobby-as-a-corporate-entity-trying-to-seize-a-controlling-interest-over-womens-health/", "image": {"width": 453, "identifier": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/453x6001.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 600}, "type": "article"}, "dc.date": "2013-11-27T16:42:20+00:00", "twitter-count": 271}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec8e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cNo corporate entity should be in position to limit women\u2019s legal access to care, or to seize a controlling interest over the health care choices of women,\u201d Jarrett wrote on the White House blog.\n\u201cThis is about family businesses \u2013 the Green family and the Hahns family \u2013 about their freedom to continue to create jobs while respecting their values.\u201dThe Green family is the owner of Hobby Lobby.\n\u201cThis is an interesting argument from the administration that pushed a health care law that severely restrictions the ability for Americans to choose health care that aligns with the value of their family and restricting companies that could be creating jobs,\u201d Torre told TheBlaze.\nLower courts split on the decision, ruling in favor of the Green family and against the Hahns family.\nWhite House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett called out Hobby Lobby and insisted the Obamacare mandate case that will go before the Supreme Court is about whether big corporations can restrict women from having access to birth control."}
