A recent study conducted at the University of Utah discovered that female mice who were fed a diet heavy in a mixture of fructose and glucose found in high-fructose corn syrup, which was comparable to the average American diet, were less likely to reproduce and more likely to die earlier than mice who were fed a diet heavy in sucrose.\n\n\u201cThis is the most robust study showing there is a difference between high-fructose corn syrup and table sugar at human-relevant doses,\u201d senior author Professor Wayne Potts, said in a statement. \u201cWhen the diabetes-obesity-metabolic syndrome epidemics started in the mid-1970s, they corresponded with both a general increase in consumption of added sugar and the switchover from sucrose being the main added sugar in the American diet to high-fructose corn syrup making up half our sugar intake.\u201d\n\nThe difference between high-fructose corn syrup and sucrose comes down to specific chemical breakdown of fructose and glucose. Although both contain almost equal amounts of fructose and glucose, in corn syrup they are separate molecules, known as monosaccharides, and in sucrose they are bonded chemically. Fructose\u2019s metabolic delivery is far different from that of glucose and even sucrose. While every cell in the body can use glucose for energy, only liver cells can break down fructose where it results in the production of a form of fat known at triglycerides.\n\nPotts and his colleagues fed 160 mice either a healthy diet with 25 percent of total calories from fructose and glucose monosaccharides found in high-fructose corn syrup or a healthy diet with 25 percent of total calories from sucrose. After around 40 weeks, the mice were released into six mouse barns \u2014 each held eight to 10 male mice and 14 to 20 female mice \u2014 where they competed for food, territory, and mates.\n\nFemale mice on the high-fructose corn syrup diet produced 26.4 percent fewer offspring and had death rates 1.87 times higher than female mice on the sucrose diet. Although this new study found no difference in male mice consuming each diet when it came to death rates, reproduction, or competing for territory, the 2013 Sugar Toxicity Study, which this new study was based on, found that male mice on a high-fructose corn syrup diet were 25 percent less likely to reproduce or hold territory.\n\n\u201cOur previous work and plenty of other studies have shown that added sugar in general is bad for your health,\u201d said James Ruff, the study\u2019s first author and a postdoctoral fellow in biology. \u201cSo first, reduce added sugar across the board. Then worry about the type of sugar, and decrease consumption of products with high-fructose corn syrup.\u201d\n\nAccording to the research team, between 13 and 25 percent of Americans consume a diet with 25 percent or more of calories from added sugars. Forty-four percent of added sugar in the average American diet comes from sucrose, while 42 percent comes from high-fructose corn syrup, and the remaining 14 percent from dextrose found in honey, molasses, juice concentrates, and agave. On the other hand, in the average global diet, high-fructose corn syrup represents eight percent of added sugar consumption.\n\nSource: Hugentobler S, Ruff J, Potts W, et al.
