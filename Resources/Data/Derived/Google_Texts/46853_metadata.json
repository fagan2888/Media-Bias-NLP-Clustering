Sinai CEO\n\n\n\nWhile the state is concerned about the finances of insurers, customers could be in for some big surprises, particularly if they do not have their premiums subsidized by federal tax credits.\n\nOne example noted by the paper was Zoom Health. That new insurer had proposed charging $233 per month in premium for a 40-year-old customer of its \"silver plan,\" which would have been the lowest-priced plan in that level of plans, the Oregonian reported.\n\nInstead, the state is calling for Zoom Health to charge $291 per month, or 25 percent more.\n\nSilver plans cover 70 percent of the in-network medical costs of their customers, with customers owing the balance in out-of-pocket payments. Silver plans are the second least-expensive type of Obamacare plans and are the most popular.\n\nRead the full Oregonian article here.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Some Oregon insurers want to keep their health plan premium price increases moderate for next year, but the state could force them to be much higher.", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Some Oregon insurers want to keep their health plan premium increases moderate for next year, but the state wants them higher.", "title": "Oregon dumps cold water on Obamacare rate requests", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/06/22/oregon-dumps-cold-water-on-low-obamacare-rates.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/06/22/102778207-coveroregon.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some Oregon insurers want to keep their health plan premium increases moderate for next year, but the state wants them higher.", "title": "Oregon dumps cold water on low Obamacare rates", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/06/22/oregon-dumps-cold-water-on-low-obamacare-rates.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/06/22/102778207-coveroregon.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@_DanMangan", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Health Insurance, Health Care, Health Insurance, Obamacare, US: News, Politics, Oregon, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-06-22T15:49:11-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dan.mangan.54", "section": "Health Insurance", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T15:51:06-0400", "tag": "Oregon"}, "pageNodeId": 102778209, "news_keywords": "Obamacare, health insurance, Oregon, premiums, rates"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd0ee\"", "article_summary": "Silver plans are the second least-expensive type of Obamacare plans and are the most popular.\nSilver plans cover 70 percent of the in-network medical costs of their customers, with customers owing the balance in out-of-pocket payments.\nInstead, the state is calling for Zoom Health to charge $291 per month, or 25 percent more.\nIn 2014, Oregon insurers collected $703 million in premiums, but paid out $830 million on their plans, the Oregonian noted, citing insurers' financial reports.\nOne example noted by the paper was Zoom Health."}
