LaPolt\u2019s basic argument is that the U.S. Copyright Office \u201cemployees are . . . the country\u2019s foremost experts on copyright law\u201d and that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) should not be involved in formulating copyright policy because \u201cUSPTO has no particular expertise in copyright law.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know where to start with such an ill-informed essay, but at a minimum we should consider the Constitutional issues that LaPolt ignores, correct the record on the facts about expertise, and try to see what led Ms. LaPolt astray.\n\nThe Copyright Office and separation of powers\n\nThe Copyright Office sits in the Library of Congress \u2013 not just as a matter of physical office space, but also as a matter of budget and personnel; in short, the Copyright Office functions as part of the legislative branch. And there is a powerful historical reason for having the Copyright Office in the Library of Congress: the deposit requirement for copyright registration of books had a natural synergy with the Library of Congress\u2019 mission to build a universal collection.\n\nBut any political science major who remembers their Con Law will recognize that this produces some thorny separation-of-powers issues because the Copyright Office is carrying out a range of administrative duties normally done by executive branch agencies (copyright registrations, section 1201 rule-making, setting compulsory license rates, etc.).\n\nIf the Copyright Office\u2019s functions were ever challenged on constitutional grounds, the Department of Justice would almost certainly argue that the Office is part of the executive branch, but everyone who has studied the issue knows that courts have been all over the map on this question. A 1978 Fourth Circuit decision squarely found the Register to be an executive branch officer, but a 1985 opinion from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that \u201c\u201cthe Library of Congress [ ] is a congressional agency\u201d and a 1996 district court decision concluded that the Copyright Office is not \u201ca component of the executive branch.\u201d Several scholars and practitioners suggest the same thing.\n\nReflecting this gray zone reality, Title 35 was amended in 1999 to state expressly that the USPTO \u201cshall advise the President, through the Secretary of Commerce, on national and certain international intellectual property policy issues\u201d and \u201cadvise Federal departments and agencies on matters of intellectual property policy in the United States and intellectual property protection in other countries.\u201d\n\nCopyright expertise in Washington\n\nIndeed, since at least the Reagan Administration the USPTO has maintained its own (considerable) team of copyright policy experts.\n\nThe current head of the USPTO policy shop is Shira Perlmutter, a copyright expert whose law review articles and testimony on copyright have been cited three times by the Supreme Court. After serving as Associate Register over at the Copyright Office for five years, Perlmutter worked in the music and audiovisual industries for a decade. Her USPTO deputy for copyright matters is David Carson, who served 13 years as the General Counsel of the Copyright Office and two more as the Copyright Office\u2019s Associate Register [not to mention a decade+ in practice doing copyright law]. Michael Shapiro, another senior lawyer on the USPTO copyright team, is a co-author or contributing author on two books on copyright law.\n\nJust those three bio notes give you some sense of how clueless the LaPolt essay is when it comes to where DC\u2019s \u201cexperts on copyright law\u201d are. The truth is that USPTO currently has a bench of copyright expertise as deep \u2013 or deeper \u2013 than the team at the Copyright Office.\n\nBeyond USPTO, there are a lot of people peppered through the executive branch who have substantial, impressive copyright knowledge \u2013 that includes people at State, the U.S Trade Representative, the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator, and the Justice Department.\n\nLaPolt\u2019s memories of her copyright registrations may be part of the reason she confuses expertise in administering a registration system with general policy expertise. Most developed economies do not have copyright registration systems, so there isn\u2019t even the chance to make this mistake. In Australia, copyright policy is focused in the Attorney General\u2019s Office; in France, the copyright policy shop sits in the Ministry of Culture; in the UK, in an integrated intellectual property office (UKIPO). No one in these countries would consider that their copyright experts aren\u2019t competent because they don\u2019t run registration systems.\n\nHow to help the Copyright Office\n\n\n\nIn today\u2019s environment, the Copyright Office doesn\u2019t need more influence over policy matters; it needs more money to bring our country\u2019s registration systems into the 21st century. The truth is that the Copyright Office is being starved for funding, partly because it sits in the Library of Congress.\n\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte Bob GoodlatteIRS head vows to finish term despite impeachment push House Republicans press case for impeaching IRS commissioner Saudis scramble for Washington allies MORE (R-Va.) should provide the leadership and funding to make our country\u2019s copyright registration system fully modern \u2013 online, searchable, efficient, and transparent. No piece of copyright reform could do more to improve the system for both copyright owners and copyright users. Something needs to be done to help the Copyright Office move forward, but strange, ill-informed commentaries about control of copyright policy do not help the discussion.\n\nHughes is the William H.
