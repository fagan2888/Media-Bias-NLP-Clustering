Greta Van Susteren went “off the record” Thursday to give her viewers a glimpse of the arrogance of power.

A man took time out of his day to appear at a Minnesota town hall meeting this week to ask why the Affordable Care Act didn’t didn’t live up to its promises. The first response of the three Democratic lawmakers conducting the meeting was to laugh.

U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Rep. Tim Walz both voted in favor of Obamacare. Although Rep. Collin Peterson cast his vote against the act, he also voted against its repeal.

Van Susteren found it disgraceful that “the very people who caused the fears and misfortunes” of the man who appeared with a legitimate question chose to laugh at him.
