Indeed, 46 percent of doctors report feeling worn down, according to a January survey, and research has also found that many nurses feel stressed out, unsupported by management and overburdened. The problem threatens patient safety and can drive staffers out of the healthcare field, the latter a pressing issue given the predicted physician shortage.\n\nIn their effort to curtail this trend, healthcare organizations have had success with a variety of strategies, according to the article. For example, Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford in Palo Alto, California, follows a similar approach as the Cleveland Clinic, and offers a \"lavender alert\" system in the prenatal intensive care unit to summon rapid response teams to provide emotional support for employees and physicians, in addition to patients and their families, during times of high stress.\n\nSan Mateo Medical Center in the San Francisco Bay Area, meanwhile, reports that its daily check-ins with staff to ensure that their needs are met and their voices are heard have improved employee engagement and communication, according to the article.\n\nAnother creative solution to the problem of burnout among nurses is the use of mindfulness meditation, or \"purposeful and nonjudgemental attentiveness to one's own experience, thoughts and feelings,\" FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nBurnout grows among physicians\n\nShould the Triple Aim become the Quadruple Aim?\n\nHigh burnout rates risk patient safety, doc workforce\n\nFierce Exclusive: Physician wellness experts on combating burnout\n\n3 weapons to battle physician stress\n\nMindfulness meditation serves as stress buster for nurses\n\nHospitals try holistic approach to treat docs' stress, burnout", "article_metadata": {"description": "Healthcare leaders have a responsibility to lessen clinician\u00a0burnout\u00a0not only for the benefit of their employees, but also to improve the quality of patient care,\u00a0according to\u00a0a post from\u00a0Hospitals & Health Networks Daily.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Healthcare leaders have a responsibility to lessen clinician\u00a0burnout\u00a0not only for the benefit of their employees, but also to improve the quality of patient care,\u00a0according to\u00a0a post from\u00a0Hospitals & Health Networks Daily.", "title": "Why healthcare must fight against doc, nurse burnout", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/why-healthcare-must-fight-against-doc-nurse-burnout/2015-05-22", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Burnout,Care Delivery,code lavender,Hospitals & Health Networks Daily,HR & Workforce Management,Lucile Packard Children's Hospital,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient safety,Physician Shortage,Quadruple Aim,San Mateo Medical Center,Triple Aim", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,HR & Workforce Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd432f\"", "article_summary": "Healthcare leaders must act now, Duffy argues, as burnout among clinical staff appears to be on the rise.\nHealthcare leaders have a responsibility to lessen clinician burnout not only for the benefit of their employees, but also to improve the quality of patient care, according to a post from Hospitals & Health Networks Daily.\nHigh burnout rates risk patient safety, doc workforceFierce Exclusive: Physician wellness experts on combating burnout3 weapons to battle physician stressMindfulness meditation serves as stress buster for nursesHospitals try holistic approach to treat docs' stress, burnout\nIn their effort to curtail this trend, healthcare organizations have had success with a variety of strategies, according to the article.\nThe problem threatens patient safety and can drive staffers out of the healthcare field, the latter a pressing issue given the predicted physician shortage."}
