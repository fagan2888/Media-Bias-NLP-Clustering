The Republican base hates it.\n\nBush\u2019s announcement this morning that he plans to \u201cexplore the possibility of running for President of the United States\u201d means that the Republican Party is going to have to sort out where it stands on this tinderbox of an issue.\n\nCommon Core is a set of academic standards put together by a bipartisan group of governors and promoted by the Obama administration. While both Republicans and Democrats first embraced the standards back in 2010 and 2011, they have fallen out of favor in the last few years. Grassroots conservatives and Republican office-holders now regularly condemn it as \u201cfederal overreach\u201d and parents have protested changes in how subjects like math are taught under states\u2019 new Common Core-aligned curricula.\n\n\n\nCommon Core now represents a kind of shorthand among Republicans: if you\u2019re a real conservative, you\u2019re against it; if you\u2019re a faker, you\u2019re for it. As a result, Republican governors in Oklahoma, Indiana, South Carolina and Missouri have scrambled to get on the right side of that divide, angrily decrying Common Core as \u201cshameless government overreach\u201d or even smearing it as \u201cObama-core.\u201d\n\nLouisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, who is often listed among the potential Republican presidential hopefuls, used to support Common Core, but now is so publicly against it that he has launched lawsuits against his own state and the U.S. Department of Education, claiming that the standards are a violation of state rights.\n\nWhile most of that is shameless political theater, it still leaves Jeb Bush in a tricky position: in order to win the Republican nomination, he\u2019s going to have to win over the Republican conservative base, which hates Common Core with the fire of a thousand suns. The easiest way to do that would be to disown Common Core. But that\u2019s not likely to be in the cards.\n\nFor the past two years, Bush has been one of the loudest proponents of Common Core, among both Republicans and Democrats, boldly refusing to walk back his support\u2014even when members of the Florida Tea Party called for his head, and even when the issue threatened to derail Republican Rick Scott\u2019s tight race during this year\u2019s midterms.\n\nIn late November, Bush told a crowd at a national education summit hosted by his group, the Foundation for Excellence in Education, that while he found the debate about Common Core \u201ctroubling,\u201d he support was unwavering. He seemed to suggest that conservatives had been tricked into thinking that the Common Core was a federal program. \u201cEducation should be a national priority, not turned into a federal program,\u201d he told the crowd, before urging them to keep fighting for reform and for Common Core.\n\nThis leaves Bush\u2014and the Republican Party, too\u2014with two basic choices. Bush can continue to embrace Common Core, but work with the Republican Party to rebrand it as an essentially Republican, states rights issue. Or he can walk back his support for the standards, which would be seen by many moderate Republicans, as well as his supporters in the education reform community, as a shameless cop-out.\n\nAlternatively, Bush could take a page out of Mitch McConnell\u2019s book, and do a little of both. After all, during the November midterm, McConnell angrily condemned Obamacare, while simultaneously supporting Kynect, which is Kentucky\u2019s version of Obamacare. Voters didn\u2019t seem to care.\n\nWhile all of this politicking makes it seem like Common Core must be a wildly exciting\u2014innovative! disruptive! far-reaching!\u2014federal policy, it\u2019s actually none of those things. It\u2019s not even federal policy.\n\nThe Common Core State Standards\u2014or CCSS, as they\u2019re known in official documents\u2014are a set of academic benchmarks. They list what students should be able to do, in math and English, after the end of each grade. For example, under Common Core, all kindergarteners should be able to count from 0 to 100; all eighth graders should be able to cite evidence for their argument in a text.\n\nCommon Core is not a national curriculum. It does not tell districts what books they have to buy, nor does it tell teachers how they need to teach. (Under Common Core, states and local school districts still have complete control over that stuff.) And perhaps most importantly, it\u2019s not even a federal program. In March 2010, 40 state governors and their state chiefs of schools formally adopted the Common Core. By the end of the next year, a total of 46 states\u2014led by both Republicans and Democrats\u2014had signed on.\n\nOne reason that bipartisan moment didn\u2019t last for long is that Obama\u2019s Department of Education began to tie federal funding, though the Reach for the Top grants, to whether states had adopted either the Common Core standards or a state version that was equally robust. That gave the Common Core standards the sheen of being a top-down federal government program\u2014which angered the Republican base.\n\nThe other main reason that Republicans turned against Common Core was that the program was poorly implemented. In some states, teachers were asked to teach to the Common Core standards before the states had even come up with an adequate curriculum or corresponding tests. In other states, new \u201cCommon Core-aligned\u201d curricula were so confusing that teachers, parents, and students rebelled. According to an October Gallup poll, 58% of Republican parents now hold a negative view of Common Core\u2014up from just 42% disapproval in April. Fewer than one in five Republican parents think the Common Core is a good idea.\n\nIf Bush wants the Republican nomination, he\u2019s going to have to find a way to change some hearts and minds.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Jeb Bush's run for president will be complicated by his support for Common Core.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Jeb Bush loves Common Core.
