Mars One—the Danish non-profit with the goal of sending humans on a one-way trip to Mars—made waves earlier this year when 100 finalists were selected from a pool of 200,000 candidates.

Since the announcement, the program has been plagued with criticism over it’s financing and proposed timeline. One astrophysicist that made the final cut went so far as to say that the whole thing was a giant scam to get money and sponsorships.

This week, NASA added to the growing skepticism of the project when it’s chief administrator Charles Bolden told a House Committee hearing that “No commercial company without the support of NASA and government is going to get to Mars.”

While the Mars One project may prove to be unfeasible, Bolden’s comment ignores the fact that space exploration is moving away from government control and toward startups like SpaceX, which has been able to bring private enterprise to space exploration.

Reason TV recently sat down with a Mars One finalist to talk about the opportunities of private space exploration and why she’s willing to give her life to travel to Mars. Produced by Paul Detrick. Approximately 4 minutes. Original release date was April 8, 2015 and the original writeup is below.
