Rick Scott\u2019s drug testing of welfare recipients \u2013 A federal appeals court on Wednesday dealt another blow to Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s crusade to conduct drug tests on welfare recipients when it upheld a lower court ruling that the practice was unconstitutional. The unanimous ruling from a bipartisan panel of judges concluded that the state failed to show any evidence as to why it was necessary to force applicants seeking Temporary Assistance for Needy Families to surrender their constitutional rights as a condition of receiving the aid. \u201cWe have no reason to think impoverished individuals are necessarily and inherently prone to drug use, or, for that matter, are more prone to drug use than the general population,\u201d the court said in its 54-page ruling.

The plan, called A Healthy Florida Works, offers an alternative to the ACA model while proposing a politically viable path for Florida\u2019s Republican-controlled House of Representatives, an obstinate opponent of the health law, to extend coverage to more residents. Proponents have presented the plan as a \u201cfree market\u201d solution that promotes \u201cpersonal accountability\u201d among beneficiaries by requiring them to pay monthly premiums and to search for employment or enroll in job training programs.

Rick Scott Wednesday criticized President Barack Obama\u2019s net neutrality proposal will hurt the economy and could cost consumers more than $18 billion a year. A congressional subcommittee Tuesday delayed a hearing on the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s proposal to regulate Internet traffic rules to assure \u201cnet neutrality. The House Energy and Commerce Committee made the announcement on its Twitter account, adding that the issue \u201cwill be top priority in the new Congress.\u201d Scott said a diet of tax cuts and reducing regulations has enabled Florida businesses to create 680,000 private sector jobs in the past four years and that Obama proposal harms job creators.

Advocates of same-sex marriage were celebrating, saying the day when gay and lesbian marriage would be authorized in the Florida has never been closer to reality. \u201cWe are over the moon excited by this decision,\u201d said Stratton Pollitzer, deputy director of Equality Florida, the state\u2019s largest LGBT rights organization. The immediate legal situation arose after U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle overturned Florida\u2019s same-sex marriage ban on Aug. 24 but put his own ruling on hold. The hold was to continue until 90 days after the U.S. Supreme Court weighed in on state same-sex marriage bans. When the Supreme Court refused to take up these cases on Oct. 6, the 90-day countdown began.

The hearing, which was held approximately two years after a female student said Winston sexually assaulted her in December 2012, was held to determine whether Winston violated any or all of four sections of the code of conduct \u2014 two for sexual misconduct and two for endangerment. John Clune, an attorney representing the woman at the closed hearing, did predict that the former Florida State Supreme Court justice presiding over the proceedings will announce his decision by the end of the year.
