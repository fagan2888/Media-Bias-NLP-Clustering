Republicans who voted to impeach Mr. Clinton criticize the current president for being less able or willing than his Democratic predecessor to woo congressional Republicans.\n\nTrent Lott, the Mississippi Republican who served as Senate majority leader from 1996 to 2001, said Mr. Clinton was \u201caffable\u201d and \u201capproachable,\u201d even toward his political opponents.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cYou could talk to him,\u201d Mr. Lott said. \u201cHe was also willing to make a deal for the good of the country.\u201d In contrast, he argued, Mr. Obama \u201chas just walked away\u201d \u2014 so if Mr. Clinton even tried to give the current president a pass, it \u201cjust won\u2019t sell.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCongressional Republicans, of course, have also refused to reach across the aisle and work with Mr. Obama the way they did in Mr. Lott\u2019s era. The current Congress is on track to become one of the least legislatively productive in recent history. That is partly because Mr. Obama faces a far more polarized electorate than Mr. Clinton did.\n\nOver the past 20 years, the number of Americans who hold extreme conservative or liberal views has doubled from 10 percent in 1994 to 21 percent in 2014, according to the Pew Research Center. And the middle ground has shrunk, with 39 percent of Americans taking a roughly equal number of liberal and conservative positions, compared with 49 percent in 1994.\n\nMr. Clinton often talks about this polarization and says that while the partisan gridlock is worse today, and the American electorate is less willing to hear arguments it disagrees with, the attacks he faced were more personal than those Mr. Obama has experienced.\n\nIn a 2012 interview with The New York Times, Mr. Clinton mentioned the \u201cmurder\u201d conspiracy theory in the 1990s, and said of Mr. Obama\u2019s tenure: \u201cNobody has tried to bankrupt him with bogus investigations, so it\u2019s not quite as bad. But the political impasse has gone on longer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will certainly not contradict the president I worked for when he argues that it was even more personal then,\u201d said William A. Galston, a former policy adviser to Mr. Clinton. \u201cBut the polarization of our official political institutions and our political parties has become even more acute than in the Clinton days,\u201d he added.\n\nPhoto\n\nThat argument absolves Mr. Clinton of his own part in the scandals of the 1990s, several historians said. \u201cThey\u2019re different situations because there were criminal allegations\u201d against Mr. Clinton, said Ken Gormley, the author of \u201cThe Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr,\u201d about the investigation led by Kenneth W. Starr.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama has attracted a lot of attacks when it\u2019s hard to point to something exactly he has done that warranted them,\u201d Mr. Gormley added.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome of the venom directed at Mr. Obama has a racial component that Mr. Clinton, a relatable white Southerner, never had to deal with, said Douglas G. Brinkley, a presidential historian and professor at Rice University. \u201cThe Clintons created huge problems of their own making,\u201d Mr. Brinkley added, while \u201cObama\u2019s problem is that he bullheadedly pushed Obamacare, and he happens to be African-American.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get more personal than questioning a person\u2019s veracity for where he was born,\u201d said Mr. Galston, the former Clinton aide, referring to the \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy theories about Mr. Obama\u2019s birth certificate.\n\nMr. Clinton\u2019s reminders about how bitter things were in Washington when he was in the White House might not be the best message as Mrs. Clinton eyes an attempt at getting back there, as president herself this time.\n\nSenator Rand Paul, a potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate, has already seized on the Lewinsky scandal as a way to remind voters that the Clinton years were not just \u201cpeace and prosperity,\u201d as Mrs. Clinton often characterized her husband\u2019s presidency during her 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nMr. Clinton is not the only president who weathered harsh attacks. Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, called former President George W. Bush a \u201cliar\u201d and a \u201closer,\u201d and protesters depicted him as Hitler.\n\n\u201cEvery president probably thinks he had it worse than all his predecessors,\u201d said Kenneth L. Khachigian, a Republican strategist who served as a speechwriter for Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon. \u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cthose of us in the Nixon years would have gladly traded places with Bill Clinton\u2019s White House.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141024125239, "twitter": {"description": "The former president argues that the personal attacks were even harsher when he was in the White House, raising the question of whether a bitter atmosphere should be an excuse for political gridlock.", "title": "Toxic Partisanship?
