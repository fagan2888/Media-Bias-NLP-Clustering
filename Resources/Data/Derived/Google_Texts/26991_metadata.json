But after several years of living with a restraining order on flash, consumers are sick already of subdued.\n\nI know I am.\n\nThat\u2019s why I was so excited to see a bright bullish color \u2014 one I had not seen since the opulent 80s \u2014 tumble onto fashion runways last year. Since mood drives fashion, and fashion drives decorating, this meant it was only a matter of time before this fancy, splashy color hit homes.\n\nIt\u2019s gold, baby.\n\nMove over tight-fisted silver and poor-cousin nickel. We\u2019re having a gold rush. It\u2019s back with a fervor, and looking lavish.\n\nLast year\u2019s runways, which trotted out 2014 fashions, were awash with gold. Tuned-in interior trend types took note. One of them was Los Angeles designer Nikki Chu.\n\n\u201cIt only takes one little shift like that for the light bulb to go off and tell me that\u2019s the direction I have to go,\u201d said Chu of her reaction to the gold accents and apparel she saw on Paris catwalks.\n\nAs a result, her new luxe and heavily-metal home d\u00e9cor line will launch at the end of July. The collection has gilded tables, mirrors, stools, candlesticks, vases and more. (See it at NikkiChuHome.com, and buy through Wayfair.com.)\n\nAbout 85 percent of the line is metallic, mostly gold, said Chu, who has been designing home fashions for 10 years.\n\n\u201cBut wait a minute,\u201d I said, checking my enthusiasm for practical reasons. \u201cHow is gold going to go over in homes today? Most are silver.\u201d\n\nThis may seem a minor sticking point to those who live in a more ethereal world than I do, but there is no getting around the fact that after those brassy gold fixtures, faucets, knobs and handles popular in the affluent \u201980s fell out of favor, a humbler brushed nickel has been the hardware of choice for decades.\n\n\u201cPeople have been living with that for a long time,\u201d Chu said. \u201cThey are ready for something different.\u201d\n\n\u201cI get that,\u201d I said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a ripple effect. It\u2019s like when pants go from high-rise to low-rise and suddenly you not only need new pants, you need new belts and underwear and longer shirts. It gets expensive.\u201d (More problems men will never have.)\n\nChu gets it, and has solutions along with these suggestions for how to infuse a little gold at home:\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid. Unlike those bachelor-party secrets, metallic furnishings don\u2019t need to stay in Vegas. If placed well, they give every home edge and glamour, Chu said.\n\nStart in your closet. After years of wearing mostly silver jewelry, I busted out last month and bought a gold purse \u2014 it goes with everything \u2014 and a big, shiny gold necklace that looks positively trashy in the best sense. It made me realize how much I\u2019d missed gold, and warmed me up to the idea of trying some at home.\n\nSuit your style. Although metallic accents slide effortlessly into high-end or modern interiors, they also work in more humble or traditional homes. The trick is to add traditional items, such as a lamp or serving tray, that have a metallic finish. Save that gold-framed octagonal mirror for a contemporary setting.\n\nMix your metals. A lot of people have a one-metal rule: all silver, all gold or all copper. Not Chu. \u201cMy core concept is not to be afraid to mix metallics. That\u2019s what makes a look.\u201d Chu tells me about the bracelets she has stacked up her arm. They are gunmetal, brassy gold, shiny silver and antique bronze. They are matte and shiny, distressed and polished. Do the same in your home, she said.\n\nCreate a balance. When introducing gold items into a home where all the existing hardware \u2014 faucets, handles, hinges and knobs \u2014 are silver, the secret is to create balance. Just one gold jar against all that silver won\u2019t work, she said. You need to infuse a lot of the new color to balance what\u2019s there.\n\nGo ombre. Like the current hair fashion, where locks change from dark to light, d\u00e9cor items that blend silver and gold can create a visual bridge when mixing in a new metallic. Chu\u2019s new line has ombre vases and candlesticks. Fabrics that weave silver with other metallics can also marry tones.\n\nKeep it on top. Because of their reflective nature, metallics jump out. So don\u2019t put them in the background \u2014 they want to be out front. Chu\u2019s own home is furnished with muted grays and greens, but all the accents are metallic. Thus, rather than putting a black pillow on a gold chair, put a gold pillow on a black chair. Think gold purse with little black dress \u2014 and maybe a flashy gold necklace.\n\nSyndicated columnist and speaker Marni Jameson is the author of \u201cHouse of Havoc\u201d and \u201cThe House Always Wins\u201d (Da Capo Press).
