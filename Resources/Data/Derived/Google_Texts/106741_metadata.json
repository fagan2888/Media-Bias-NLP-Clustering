While American audiences know him best for Fox News and his subsequent purchase of the Wall Street Journal, Murdoch\u2019s properties in the U.K. are probably even more ubiquitous, despite the recent phone tapping scandal.\n\nFolkenflik talked to Salon about Murdoch\u2019s \u201cArchie Bunker\u201d mentality, his legacy and how competing with him has changed the New York Times. Readers can also find an excerpt from Folkenflik\u2019s book, about the birth of Fox News, here. This transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat about Rupert Murdoch would Salon readers find most surprising?\n\nHe\u2019s not as uniformly and as reflexively conservative as people often characterize him. He started out in college at Oxford as actually being pretty far left\u2013an idealistic kid on campus in Britain\u2013and had a bust of Lenin in his rooms\u2013somewhat for sport but, you know, showing his sympathies a little bit. He had what were considered to be fairly progressive views on, say, aboriginal people of Australia in the \u201960s and \u201970s.\n\nThe Australian newspaper, which was his creation in\u2013I believe\u20131964, has done some very intensive and thoughtful reporting on the treatment of aboriginals\u2013their conditions, their place in Australian life and culture\u2013in a way that Americans who think of Murdoch simply from the front pages of the New York Post or the top rated shows of Fox News might find hard to believe. He\u2019s more complex, I think, in terms of his own political instincts\u2013and at times more self-contradictory than people fully realize.\n\nHis business instincts don\u2019t seem that contradictory.\n\nHis business sense is based on his gut instinct. What he cares most about are the newspapers, even though they\u2019ve faded from their financial prominence. And his sense for the newspapers\u2013his insight\u2013was that he felt that a center-right, populism, punching-up-at-elites, identifying-targets-of-derision-and-trying-to-take-them-down would sell. [He mixed it with] a lively diet of entertainment news and all kinds of coverage of sports, and the treatment of politics often as sport\u2013at times as bloodsport\u2013in a way that people you might once have described as Reagan democrats found appealing. You know, the New York Post has never been a money maker, but there is certainly a sense that it appeals to what a former New York Post editor and publisher described to me as the \u201cArchie Bunker mentality\u201d in the outer boroughs of New York as well.\n\nWe\u2019re all familiar with the current media environment, and in the U.K. it\u2019s the same sort of thing with their tabloids\u2013but was this a revolutionary idea, or did he just execute better than everyone else?\n\nIn the U.S., Murdoch changed the very nature of the New York Post. He made all kinds of promises to Dorothy Schiff, the owner of the New York Post in the 1970s, when he sought to acquire it and did, and he convinced her it would be sort of a much more sedate, somewhat left of center publication. That all went out the window when he took it over. And who would think he would maintain and own it to be somebody else\u2019s publication, really?\n\nIn the States, there have always been gossip publications and tabloids and scandal rags, but there was really a division between what was seen as the \u201cproper press\u201d or the \u201cmainstream news media\u201d and tabloid journalism. In this country there\u2019s always been a split, and Murdoch\u2019s insight was to say there\u2019s something in the center of that that can do both\u2013you can cover enough of culture high and low, you can cover politics, you could cover business and finance\u2013you\u2019d get a lot of people in Manhattan that way\u2013and yet you\u2019d still go after the celebrities as though they are targets in a video game. That was, I think, his insight.\n\nThe New York Daily News had always been the photo newspaper, and so certainly gossip and crime and scandal were part of the media diet in big cities like L.A., like Chicago, like New York, like Boston\u2013if you think back to the years of Hearst and Pulitzer, competing a century ago, they certainly had times when they would descend to the lowest common denominator. So, I wouldn\u2019t say that Murdoch invented it; I would say that in some ways he purified and perfected the mix.\n\nIt sounds like you think he feels a lot of this sort of Archie Bunker populism, although he was born into comfortable circumstances and has obviously succeeded beyond imagination.\n\nHe was born into a very affluent, influential family\u2013his father had been an executive in newspapers in the second-largest city in Australia and was able to leave his mother this enormous estate outside Melbourne, and to leave him the small newspaper in Adelaide as a starting point. Now, Murdoch was always upset that he felt his father had been screwed out of a couple of papers that he\u2019d gotten an ownership stake in just before his death, and was always angry about that, and it was a moment of triumph when he was able to buy back those papers over the years.\n\nAnd, as you say, he absolutely built up an empire and a vision of what could be achieved far beyond what anyone could have imagined\u2013including his father. But if you read his Twitter feed, which his aides at times roll their eyes at \u2014 but their feeling is \u201cYou be the one to tell him not to tweet\u201d\u2013there\u2019s a real visceral personal expression of what he\u2019s thinking at any time.\n\nHe\u2019ll go off on the BBC and the Guardian in the U.K., and if Prime Minister Cameron meets with the family members of victims whose phones were hacked by his former tabloid, News of the World, he will often rail against what he calls the \u201ctoffs\u201d\u2013the wealthy, privileged types in Britain who are meeting to try and close down press freedoms. Now, there\u2019s a very legitimate argument to be had about the kind of regulation of the press that\u2019s being proposed by various figures in the UK in the wake of the hacking scandal. But the idea that Rupert Murdoch, the son of a successful newspaper executive, who\u2019s himself a billionaire many times over, a graduate of Oxford, and a guy who\u2019s got world leaders on speed dial, is somehow being shut out by the privileged and the wealthy and the elite \u2014 the idea that he has not created his own establishment that has forced these other guys to bend to his interests \u2014 is preposterous.\n\nI was struck by what you said about his promises to Dorothy Schiff about the New York Post. He made similar promises to the Bancroft family with the Wall Street Journal. Why would anybody believe what he says?\n\nIf you\u2019re asking why anybody would believe what he says, I would say, well, two things: There\u2019s nothing in his record to suggest that if he makes promises, that he will be hands-off in the running of a news organization, or particularly the running of a newspaper, that he would keep such promises. You can look back to the New York Post. You can look to the Times of London and the Sunday Times. You can look to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nEach and every time he has installed people who either slavishly adhere to how he looks at the world or are at least conscious enough of it that it works well. Now, he does have a different approach to his broadsheets\u2013to his prestige papers\u2013than to his tabloids. He\u2019s much more hands-on with his tabloids on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis. But there\u2019s no reason to believe any such promise; he\u2019s just proven time and again that he\u2019ll do what he needs to do to get the transaction done.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s not clear to me why people would want to believe such a promise. If somebody buys a newspaper he or she is entitled to have influence over how that newspaper is run. I don\u2019t understand really the concept behind it. The Bancrofts made a decision: they would solve a couple of decades of tension over ownership, over diminishing returns during terrible, wrenching times for the newspaper industry. They wanted to sell out, and yet they wanted to feel that they\u2019d still maintained the traditions of the Journal and of Dow Jones\u2013and they wanted it both ways.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NPR's media correspondent discusses the tycoon's politics, his broken promises and how he changed the media", "title": "David Folkenflik: Rupert Murdoch\u2019s rules", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "NPR's media correspondent discusses the tycoon's politics, his broken promises and how he changed the media", "title": "David Folkenflik: Rupert Murdoch\u2019s rules", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/10/27/david_folkenflik_rupert_murdochs_rules/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/rupert_murdoch2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "NPR's media correspondent discusses the tycoon's politics, his broken promises and how he changed the media", "title": "David Folkenflik: Rupert Murdoch\u2019s rules", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/rupert_murdoch2.jpg", "creator": "@alexhalperin", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Alex Halperin", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Australia, Books, Conservatism, Fox News, Journalism, Media, newspapers, Rupert Murdoch, U.K., Wall Street Journal, Writers", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Folkenflik talked to Salon about Murdoch\u2019s \u201cArchie Bunker\u201d mentality, his legacy and how competing with him has changed the New York Times.\nTopics: Australia, Books, Conservatism, Fox News, Journalism, Media, newspapers, Rupert Murdoch, U.K., Wall Street Journal, Writers, Media News, Business News, News, Politics NewsIn his new book, \u201cMurdoch\u2019s World,\u201d NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik takes on Rupert Murdoch, the Australian business magnate who is probably the most powerful media figure ever.\nI was struck by what you said about his promises to Dorothy Schiff about the New York Post.\nYou can look back to the New York Post.\nYou know, the New York Post has never been a money maker, but there is certainly a sense that it appeals to what a former New York Post editor and publisher described to me as the \u201cArchie Bunker mentality\u201d in the outer boroughs of New York as well."}
