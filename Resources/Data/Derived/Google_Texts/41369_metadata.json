As we consider their sacrifices, let us vow to live up to the promises that we\u2019ve made to them and their families.\n\nWe cannot rest until our veterans have the 21st-century health care system they deserve. It is the least a grateful nation can do. (Scroll down for full video of these remarks.)\n\nThis is also a time to consider the line in Scripture that says, \u201cto whom much is given, much is expected.\u201d Republicans are humbled by the trust the American people have placed in us.\n\nWe\u2019ll honor that trust by listening to you, by making your priorities our priorities.\n\nThat means focusing first on helping middle-class families still struggling to pay the bills and find good-paying jobs.\n\nWe\u2019ll start by debating and voting on the many jobs bills the House has acted on with bipartisan support. We\u2019ll work to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which will mean lower energy costs for families and more jobs for American workers.\n\nWe\u2019ll advance the Hire More Heroes Act, which will encourage employers to hire more of our nation\u2019s veterans.\n\nAnd we\u2019ll take on ObamaCare regulations that threaten the 40-hour workweek and the pay and peace of mind of so many Americans.\n\nThese types of common-sense solutions, so long ignored by the outgoing Senate majority, offer a good starting point. They\u2019ll help break the logjam here in Washington, and establish a foundation of certainty and stability that both parties can build on.\n\nFrom there, more good ideas will follow, and with them, a chance to address some of the most pressing challenges that we face, whether it\u2019s a broken tax code that\u2019s driving jobs overseas, health care costs that continue to rise, or an education system that leaves too many of our young people unprepared for the future.\n\nThis is a time for solutions to get our economy moving again, and we\u2019re eager to get to work.\n\nYour priorities will be our priorities. That\u2019s our pledge to you, the people we serve. ####\n\nPrevious Weekly Remarks by both parties are available by clicking here.\n\nRELATED:\n\nObama: Let\u2019s pay higher wages\n\nAmericans agree now: Guns make homes safer\n\nMidterm GOP election results for the history books\n\nOf course: Obama ducks responsibility for Dems\u2019 midterm disaster", "article_metadata": {"description": "Speaker John Boehner gives the Republican Party's Weekly RemarksThis is the time of year when we pause to pay tribute to America\u2019s veterans \u2014 the", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Speaker John Boehner gives the Republican Party\u2019s Weekly RemarksThis is the time of year when we pause to pay tribute to America\u2019s veterans \u2014 the ones who gave all a person can gi\u2026", "title": "John Boehner: Keeping faith with vets and voters", "url": "http://www.investors.com/politics/andrew-malcolm/john-boehner-veterans-day-republican-remarks/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7.png", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@IBDInvestors"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7-270x270.png", "date": "2014-11-08 06:24:00:-08:00", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-08T06:24:00+00:00", "modified_time": "-001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc898\"", "article_summary": "Speaker John Boehner gives the Republican Party\u2019s Weekly RemarksThis is the time of year when we pause to pay tribute to America\u2019s veterans \u2014 the ones who gave all a person can give so that we may live free.\nWe\u2019ll honor that trust by listening to you, by making your priorities our priorities.\nThat means focusing first on helping middle-class families still struggling to pay the bills and find good-paying jobs.\nWe cannot rest until our veterans have the 21st-century health care system they deserve.\nAs we consider their sacrifices, let us vow to live up to the promises that we\u2019ve made to them and their families."}
