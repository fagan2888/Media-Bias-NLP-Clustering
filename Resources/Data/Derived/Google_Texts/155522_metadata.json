Bradford, who is wearing a brace on his left knee, walked gingerly to the sideline, was examined by medical personnel behind the Rams\u2019 bench before being escorted to the locker room for further medical tests.\n\nThe Rams provided little information on Bradford\u2019s injury, saying only he has a knee injury and will not return to the game.\n\nBradford was playing his second preseason game after making his exhibition debut last week against Green Bay. Fisher had hoped to play Bradford for most of the first half. He went 4 of 9 for 77 yards before leaving.\n\nBradford has made 49 career starts since he was drafted with the No. 1 overall pick by St. Louis in 2010. He was replaced by Shaun Hill.\n\nThe knock on Bradford is that he has not been able to stay healthy. He played in just 10 games in 2011.\n\nSt. Louis lost two other players in the opening quarter as defensive tackle Kendall Langford and guard Rodger Saffold went out with leg injuries.\n\nTwo more Rams were injured on the same play in the second quarter. Left cornerback Trumaine Johnson and defensive tackle Michael Brockers went down, but Brockers walked off under his own power.\n\nJoyner\u2019s injury appeared to be serious. He was taken off the field on a cart, and several teammates wished him well before he was driven away.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bradford missed the final nine games last season after surgery to repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his knee.
