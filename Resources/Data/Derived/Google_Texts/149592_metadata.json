In all the reporting about the threatening texts and voicemails sent to Martin, allegedly by Incognito, there is no use of gay slurs.\n\nI bring this up because over the past week, as this story grew, I heard from a half-dozen friends who thought I had some insight in the Martin story. They all wondered if Martin was gay and this was the reason for him being bullied. I admit this thought had occurred to me, even though I knew nothing about Martin other than he was a second-round draft pick out of Stanford. He did attend the same high school \u2014 Harvard Westlake in Los Angeles \u2014 as Jason Collins, but that is just a coincidence.\n\nMartin has taken a leave from the Dolphins and the team has suspended Incognito (he\u2019s likely done in Miami) after these texts and voicemails were reported by ESPN:\n\nRichie Incognito left this VM for Jonathan Martin in April 2013: \u201cHey, wassup, you half n\u2014\u2013 piece of (expletive)\u2026 \u201cI saw you on Twitter, you been training ten weeks. (I want to) (expletive) in your (expl) mouth\u2026. \u201c(I\u2019m going to) slap your (expletive) mouth. (I\u2019m going to) slap your real mother across the face (laughter). Incognito to Martin, all on same VM in April 2013: \u201c(Expletive) you, you\u2019re still a rookie. I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d\n\nThese are appalling and racist and it\u2019s easy to see why Martin felt threatened enough to report them. What they aren\u2019t is homophobic and that\u2019s noteworthy because bullying has become so closely tied to LGBT people. It\u2019s understandable why \u2014 nearly 9 out of 10 LGBT youths say they have been verbally harassed by their orientation. There also have been way too many tragic stories of bullied LGBT youth killing themselves. And bullying is not confined to high school. Adults can be bullied too, so when the Martin story first broke, it was understandable that people wondered whether there was a gay angle.\n\nIf there is a connection to be made with this incident and gay issues, it is the idea of someone not fitting in because they are \u201cdifferent.\u201d Martin\u2019s nickname on the Dolphins was \u201cBig Weirdo,\u201d for reasons not entirely clear. It seems like he never fit in with the team\u2019s culture (which included veterans shaking down rookies for expensive meals and trips). Martin is a \u201cclassics major who attended Stanford and is the son of two Harvard graduates, the New York Times reports.\n\nIn contrast, Incognito has long been a troublemaker, going back to his days at Nebraska. From the New York Times:\n\nIncognito revealed glimpses of his locker room behavior on Twitter. In April, he posted a photograph of Martin squeezing into a go-kart. \u201cBig weirdo barely fits in the go kart,\u201d Incognito wrote. At question is whether Incognito wandered past the loose parameters of locker-room decorum. But current and former players did not seem surprised that Incognito, 30, would be at the center of this type of incident. Throughout his collegiate and professional career, Incognito has had an image as an energetic player who will do anything to win, even if he has to cross the line into dirty play. A New Jersey native, Incognito excelled at the University of Nebraska, but in 2004, he was suspended because of incidents off the field. That did not deter the St. Louis Rams from drafting him in the third round the next year. He built a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that included games with multiple personal fouls and a $50,000 fine for head-butting. He was also fined for three incidents in one game, including verbally abusing a game official.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He's been bullied, yes, but it's irresponsible to use him as a case study for how an out player might be treated", "title": "This isn\u2019t about Jonathan Martin\u2019s sexual orientation", "og": {"url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/11/09/footballer_jonathan_martin_wasnt_bullied_because_he_was_gay_but_that_doesnt_make_it_ok_partner/", "site_name": "Salon", "type": "article", "description": "He's been bullied, yes, but it's irresponsible to use him as a case study for how an out player might be treated", "title": "This isn\u2019t about Jonathan Martin\u2019s sexual orientation"}, "twitter": {"description": "He's been bullied, yes, but it's irresponsible to use him as a case study for how an out player might be treated", "title": "This isn\u2019t about Jonathan Martin\u2019s sexual orientation", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@salon"}, "author": "Jim Buzinski", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Discrimination, Football, gay slurs, MIami Dolphins, outsports", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6b54\"", "article_summary": "There also have been way too many tragic stories of bullied LGBT youth killing themselves.\nThey all wondered if Martin was gay and this was the reason for him being bullied.\nIt\u2019s understandable why \u2014 nearly 9 out of 10 LGBT youths say they have been verbally harassed by their orientation.\nTopics: Discrimination, Football, gay slurs, MIami Dolphins, outsports, Media News, NewsThis article originally appeared on OutsportsAs details continue to emerge surrounding the apparent bullying and harassment of Miami Dolphins offensive lineman Jonathan Martin by teammate Richie Incognito, one thing this doesn\u2019t seem to be about is sexual orientation.\nIn all the reporting about the threatening texts and voicemails sent to Martin, allegedly by Incognito, there is no use of gay slurs."}
