Yet there is still resistance to using medication to treat it.\n\nTym Rourke, who chairs the New Hampshire Governor\u2019s Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention, Intervention and Treatment, says that some substance-abuse programs refuse to use methadone or Suboxone.\n\n\u201cI have friends and allies and partners in the recovery community who do feel it\u2019s replacing one drug for another,\u201d Rourke says, \u201cand who define recovery as recovery from everything.\u201d\n\nRelated story: As N.H.'s Opioid Crisis Grows, Primary-Care Doctors are Slow to Treat Addiction\n\nBut research dating back decades has consistently shown that programs that rely solely on behavioral therapy have a poor success rate when it comes to opioid addiction. For example, two studies that followed long-term addicts, one in 1943 and another 30 years later, found relapse rates as high as 80 percent within two years of discharge from intensive residential treatment.\n\nVideo: Hear the medical staff at one local community health center talk about their decision to start offering Suboxone to patients, and what they've learned along the way.\n\nMore recently, a 2009 review of 11 studies by the Cochrane Collaborative, an independent research network, found methadone \"significantly more effective\" than abstinence, or drug-free, models in keeping patients in treatment and preventing relapse.\n\nThe introduction of Suboxone in 2002 was considered a major advance in medication-assisted treatment, or MAT. The drug \u2013 buprenorphine, plus naloxone as an abuse deterrent \u2013 is safer than methadone, which can cause overdose. And because it has a longer half-life and stays in the system longer than methadone, patients don\u2019t suffer withdrawal if they miss a dose.\n\nSuboxone has been found to be as just effective as methadone at reducing opioid use, although the evidence suggests methadone might keep people in treatment longer.\n\nCindy Parks Thomas, with the Heller School for social Policy and Management at Brandeis University, conducted a review of studies on buprenorphine in 2014. She said the research, which involved an analysis of 16 clinical trials, was commissioned by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA, the federal agency that oversees the Suboxone program.\n\n\u201cThey wanted to get more information out there about the evidence to combat some of the preconceived notions that this was just another opioid that patients will get hooked on,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said one \u201csticky\u201d issue that hasn\u2019t been resolved is if and when to discontinue Suboxone treatment. Neither SAMHSA or leading addiction experts have settled on when a patient is considered stable enough to begin reducing, or tapering, the daily dosage.\n\nResearch on tapering versus long-term use is limited. But one 2011 study looked at two Suboxone protocols, including counseling, for patients with prescription opioid addiction.\n\nPhase one involved 12 weeks of treatment - two weeks on the drug, two weeks of dose reduction, followed by eight weeks of follow up. Only 43 of 653 patients \u2013 less than 7 percent \u2013 made it through the 12 weeks without using opioids.\n\nA second group of 360 patients underwent longer treatment: 12 weeks on Suboxone, four weeks of taper and eight weeks of follow up. Nearly half that cohort \u2013 177 patients \u2013 made it through the treatment period successfully.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still an open question,\u201d says Tym Rourke. \u201cBut ultimately it has to be in the best interests of the patient. There may be emerging science that tell us that there are some patients for whom a lifetime of [Suboxone] is required.\u201d\n\nExperts says more of these studies on duration of treatment are needed in the wake of the Affordable Care Act, which mandates that state Medicaid programs cover substance-abuse treatments,.\n\nRobin Clark, an associate professor at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, and director of research and evaluation at UMass\u2019s Center for Health Policy and Research, has studied state Medicaid policies on Suboxone, including lifetime limits on prescriptions imposed by nearly a dozen states.\n\nHe concludes there is no evidence that it reduces costs or cuts down on diversion of the drug onto the street.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people around the country who think of this as an acute problem, when it\u2019s really a chronic relapsing condition that for many people is a lifelong struggle,\u201d Clark says. \u201cIf you think of it that way, people might need to stay on it a lot longer and there might be some people who need to stay on it indefinitely.\n\n\u201cWhat we do know is that people tend not to die when they are using it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "NH News", "description": "Talk to people on the front lines of New Hampshire\u2019s opioid crisis, and most of them will agree that addiction is a chronic disease.
