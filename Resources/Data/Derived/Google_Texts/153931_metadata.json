Levin signed copies of, and discussed his youth-focused book Plunder and Deceit: Big Government\u2019s Exploitation of Young People and the Future.\n\nHe described this new project as a collection of pamphlets like those distributed during the pre-revolutionary period in America. Each one provides information on a topic such as radical environmentalism, illegal immigration, social security, education, Obamacare, national security and more. Each section is aimed at providing facts to equip Americans and help articulate the impact of a Leviathan-like government on the younger generation.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re Americans, we don\u2019t surrender our country, we don\u2019t surrender our children and our grandchildren to the left and to big government and their destructive forces,\u201d Levin told the energetic crowd. He began explaining that this project is intended to move away from the usual platitudes.\n\n\u201cWhen is the last time\u2026when is the first time our kids were discussed when we discussed immigration? How can it be that illegal immigrant kids are dreamers? Nobody talks about our kids as dreamers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the impact on kids that go to college and graduates in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM)?\u201d\n\nLevin cited U.S. Census Bureau statistics: \u201cAlmost 30 percent of young people who graduated in these majors can\u2019t get jobs in those positions and yet you will hear politicians including conservatives say we need tens of thousands more of these H1B visas to bring in more and more people who have these skills. But we have people who have these skills too.\u201d\n\n\u201cSilicon Valley among others, they want to pay them at a very cheap price,\u201d he said, backing his claim up with Census Bureau reports showing income in STEM fields having been flat since 2007.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile we have $1.3 trillion in student loan debt.\u201d\n\nHe points to two perspective groups: the parents and the grandparents, and the \u201940 years old and under\u2019 contingent.\n\n\u201cDo you want to live in freedom and prosperity?\u201d he asks of the younger generation. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, then you can continue to vote this way and support this way and follow what your Marxist professors tell you and what Hollywood tells you and so forth, but you\u2019re going to be the poorest generation in many generations.\u201d\n\nLevin suggests this generation could participate in \u201cprudential, civil protests.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe private sector isn\u2019t your enemy. Capitalism isn\u2019t your enemy. Big government is your enemy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think millions of people are suddenly going to change overnight,\u201d he remarked.\n\nIn the pre-revolutionary period, how did people communicate? \u201cThey communicated with pamphlets. I mean, Thomas Paine\u2019s pamphlets had an enormous impact on this country. Believe it or not they would read pamphlets about John Locke and Charles de Montesquieu. They were very well read. They didn\u2019t have TV and all the rest; they didn\u2019t have distractions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey read about the reformation and the enlightenment. They read about representative government. This stuff interested them.\u201d\n\nLevin referred to the late President Ronald Reagan, in whose administration he served: \u201cWe cannot expect the political parties or TV networks, cable networks or media or academia or any of these others to do our work for us. It\u2019s got to be from the bottom up. It\u2019s got to be families. It has to be the grassroots. It has to be communities, churches, synagogues and I want us to get back to that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThink about the left. They never give up,\u201d said Levin. \u201cFor a hundred years they wanted national healthcare. They finally got it, a hundred years later.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times-bestselling author went on to encourage the crowd, \u201cMy attitude is, I don\u2019t give up hope. I think the hour is late. But I don\u2019t give up hope that we, as parents and grandparents, press our case, tens of millions of us, we will have a bigger effect than any college or university, any media out there, if we stick to it and we push it.\u201d\n\nHe gave the example argument, \u201cIf the minimum wage is pushed up to $15 an hour, do you realize your kid\u2019s going to lose his job? Because most people on minimum wage are not middle class, middle aged people. There are young kids, first jobs, part time jobs who are unskilled or low skilled. Particularly in our urban areas that means all those kids are not going to get jobs. They\u2019re not worth $15 an hour in terms of productivity.\u201d\n\nLevin went on to discuss several of the other subjects covered in his book of pre-revolutionary-style pamphlets including some of the poignant arguments and tools useful to combat the deceit of the left.\n\nThe event was live streamed on the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Library website.\n\nTickets for Levin\u2019s Sunday evening event sold out 11 minutes after going on sale, a record for any author at the library according to the evening\u2019s moderator.\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mark Levin spoke Sunday at the Ronald Reagan Library on Plunder and Deceit: Big Government\u2019s Exploitation of Young People and the Future", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Mark Levin spoke Sunday at the Ronald Reagan Library on Plunder and Deceit: Big Government\u2019s Exploitation of Young People and the Future", "title": "Mark Levin: Immigrant Kids Are Dreamers, Nobody Says Our Kids Are", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1281, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/IMG_1159-Version-2.jpeg", "height": 960}, "updated_time": "2015-08-17T06:36:08-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2015/08/17/nyt-best-seller-mark-levin-immigrant-kids-are-dreamers-but-nobody-says-our-kids-are-dreamers/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mark Levin spoke Sunday at the Ronald Reagan Library on Plunder and Deceit: Big Government\u2019s Exploitation of Young People and the Future", "creator": "@michellediana", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/IMG_1159-Version-2.jpeg", "title": "Mark Levin: Immigrant Kids Are Dreamers, Nobody Says Our Kids Are", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "author, bestseller, Education, healthcare, immigration, Mark Levin, minimum wage, New York Times, obamacare, plunder and deceit, radio, the left,Big Journalism, Breitbart California,Mark Levin", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-08-17T03:19:25-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/michdimoo", "section": "Big Journalism", "modified_time": "2015-08-17T06:36:08-07:00", "tag": "the left", "categories": "Big Journalism,Breitbart California"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "There are young kids, first jobs, part time jobs who are unskilled or low skilled.\nHow can it be that illegal immigrant kids are dreamers?\nThe event was live streamed on the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Library website.\nBelieve it or not they would read pamphlets about John Locke and Charles de Montesquieu.\nParticularly in our urban areas that means all those kids are not going to get jobs."}
