Mealtime exchanges between parent and child decreased because, \u201cthe mother\u2019s gaze and/or attention was directed at a device,\u201d study co-author Dr. Jenny Radesky, clinical instructor in developmental-behavioral pediatrics at Boston University School of Medicine, said in a university news release.\n\nOverall, Radesky\u2019s team found that the use of cellphones and other devices during meals was tied with 20 percent fewer verbal and 39 percent fewer nonverbal interactions with their children.\n\nMothers with the highest use of mobile devices during meals were also much less likely to provide \u201cencouragement\u201d to their children, according to the study published online this week in the journal Academic Pediatrics.\n\nExperts weren\u2019t surprised by the findings.\n\n\u201cThis study documents what we clearly see to be true \u2014 that is, that everyone is connected to an electronic interface way too much and ignoring real-time human relations,\u201d said Dr. Ron Marino, associate chair of pediatrics at Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, N.Y.\n\n\u201cChildren must have the emotional, physical and verbal presence of a loving caretaker,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen a mother is distracted by electronic media, the opportunities to develop language and social cognition are diminished or lost.\u201d\n\nDr. Andrew Adesman is chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at Cohen Children\u2019s Medical Center of New York, in New Hyde Park, N.Y. He said that, \u201cjust as we would not want parents intermittently reading a newspaper or glimpsing a TV program during family meals, parents should make a conscious effort to put away their mobile devices during mealtime. Most text messages and e-mails can wait the 20 minutes or so that families spend together at the dinner table.\u201d\n\nThe study involved 225 mother-and-child pairs, all from low-income households. Radesky\u2019s team videotaped the mom/child pairs when the kids were 6 years old, in a setting where the children were being presented with unfamiliar foods at the family dinner table.\n\nAccording to the researchers, being introduced to new foods can be stressful for young children, but mothers who used mobile devices had 26 percent fewer verbal and 48 percent fewer nonverbal interactions with their youngsters during meals that featured the new foods.\n\nThis suggests that these mothers were less \u201cavailable\u201d to help their children through this new experience, Radesky\u2019s team said.\n\n\u201cAlthough this study looked at low-income families in an experimental setting, there is no reason to think that these findings don\u2019t reflect what goes in households across America during family meals at dinnertime,\u201d Adesman said.\n\n\u201cCommon sense suggests that parents should make a concerted effort to be \u2018device-free\u2019 during family dinners,\u201d he added. \u201cThis will likely not only have immediate benefits on the family unit, but it will also set a positive example for children since it will just be a matter of time before these kids as teens likewise have mobile devices with their potential to distract.\u201d\n\n-Robert Preidt\n\n###\n\nMore information\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics offers tips for effective parenting.\n\nSOURCES: Ron Marino, M.D., associate chair of pediatrics, Winthrop-University Hospital, Mineola, N.Y.; Andrew Adesman, M.D., chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics, Cohen Children\u2019s Medical Center of New York, New Hyde Park, N.Y.; Boston University, news release, Dec. 9, 2014.
