"I think overall, Republicans want us to hold the line on spending and increasing the debt. That's why I start out disappointed because increasing the spending and increasing spending caps is the wrong way to go," Paul told CNN Tuesday afternoon. "I haven't met a Republican outside the beltway who is for raising the debt ceiling and raising the spending caps. So I think we've started out on a bad foot."

Ryan met with Senate Republicans for the first time as speaker Tuesday and hashed out ways the two sides could push more conservative priorities to President Barack Obama's desk.

Paul's comment stood out because many congressional Republicans, even members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, who have slammed the budget deal have chosen not to rip the new speaker over his vote for it.
