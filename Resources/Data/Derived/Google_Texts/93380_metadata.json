The White House has lied about so many things, why wouldn\u2019t they lie about this? They lied about Benghazi. They lied about IRS corruption. They lied about not spying on Americans.\u201d\n\nOn last night\u2019s \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor,\u201d Fox News pundit and Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer tamped down the rhetoric, though just by a smidgen: \u201cAnd these numbers that they are touting are phony numbers. What you\u2019re getting is them telling you 6 or 7 million have signed up. That\u2019s like saying, anybody who goes on Amazon, orders a nifty stereo set and puts it in the shopping cart has purchased the stereo set.\u201d\n\nAnd on \u201cThe Kelly File\u201d last night, White House correspondent Ed Henry said, \u201cCan we believe the 7 million number? Because you\u2019ll remember back in October and November, they were saying, \u2018Oh, look, you know, in order to get accurate numbers we have to give you monthly numbers, because they\u2019re just trickling in.'\u201d\n\nThat would be correct. As the Erik Wemple Blog pointed out in a previous post, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has gotten awfully selective with its release of sign-up tallies. On March 17, for instance, it posted a note about hitting the 5 million mark, and news organizations promptly spread the word. It did something similar on Feb. 25, at the 4 million mark. All this despite protestations last fall that it couldn\u2019t give rolling indications of sign-ups.\n\nAs for Krauthammer\u2019s critique about how many folks have paid, HHS says that such information from insurers \u201cis neither final nor complete. When we have accurate and reliable data regarding premium payments, we will make that information available.\u201d Another consideration: Those who signed up after March 15 don\u2019t get their coverage until May 1, and so their premiums aren\u2019t due until later in April.\n\nInstead of cycling through such details, however, it\u2019s more convenient to allege deception.\n\nOn March 11, HHS announced that 4.2 million people had signed up through March 1, a tally that reflected some sluggishness in signups. Bad news, in other words, for Obamacare. That night on Fox News, the integrity of Obamacare\u2019s enrollment number got a gentler treatment. On the March 11 Fox News program \u201cSpecial Report,\u201d for example, White House correspondent Ed Henry stated, \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s team is making progress on sign-ups but still well short by two key measurements. Secretary Kathleen Sebelius revealing late today through the end of February, 4.2 million people have signed up in the health insurance marketplace, so they need 2.8 million more by the end of enrollment on March 31st to meet the original goal of 7 million enrollees or even the recently revised goal of 6 million.\u201d\n\nOn that night\u2019s \u201cOn the Record\u201d with Greta Van Susteren, former New Hampshire governor John Sununu mis-predicted: \u201cThey have got about two weeks left, two and a half weeks. At the pace they have gotten the last two weeks, they will probably be a little under 4.5 million. So they will be short 2.5 million.\u201d And the \u201cWeekly Standard\u2019s\u201d Stephen Hayes, also on Fox News\u2019s air, ventured this prediction: \u201cJanuary is slower than December, and they need to have a huge March. They\u2019re not gonna have it. They are not going to hit their mark.\u201d\n\nThose folks had better hope that this 7.1 million number is \u201cphony.\u201d But when the enrollment numbers are low, well, they have a tendency to be more credible on a certain cable-news network.\n\nThe lesson here is that Obamacare is jumble of exposed flanks for critics. If the demographics in the sign-up figures don\u2019t look right, you can scream about the actuarial \u201cdeath spiral.\u201d If the raw figures aren\u2019t high enough, you can scream about the millions of Americans left out in the cold. If HHS is changing its policy on the release of numbers, you can scream about transparency. If premiums are headed in the wrong direction, you can scream about Americans struggling to make ends meet.
