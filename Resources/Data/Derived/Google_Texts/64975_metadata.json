It really depends on what data set you pull, how you view the data in that data set, or if you are really looking for the truth (and not just trying to \u201cprove\u201d Obamacare is good or bad).\n\nGoing back to Professor Krugman\u2019s now infamous statement:\n\nThe health exchanges are off to a famously rocky start, but many, though by no means all, of the cost-control measures have already kicked in. Has the curve been bent? The answer, amazingly, is yes. In fact, the slowdown in health costs has been dramatic.\n\nIf one is trying to convince you that health care costs are falling \u2013 the \u201cgo to\u201d place is the health sector data in the Consumer Price Index.\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Change in Medical Care Costs \u2013 Index (blue line, left axis) and Year-over-Year Change (red line, right axis)\n\nFigure 1 \u201cproves\u201d that the rate of growth of medical care prices have been decelerating \u2013 although it also proves health care prices are still rising. One pundit, using the medical care components of the PPI and PCE, argued the opposite:\n\n\u201cHealthcare inflation has begun to accelerate,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank\u2019s Joe LaVorgna pointing to the new producer price index numbers. \u201cThe price of \u201cselected health care industries\u201d rose +0.3% in January following gains of +0.2% in December and +0.3% in November.\u201d These numbers are likely to have an amplified effect when we get an updated reading on the PCE deflator, the preferred inflation measure of the Federal Reserve.\n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Graph Accompanying above quote\n\nI am at a loss why one would use change in price to argue that medical care costs are falling or rising. We are not talking about coffee here where the usage is relatively stable. The more procedures performed and the more pills popped \u2013 the more money will be spent on medical expenses. For medical expenditures, it does not matter that the costs for a particular pill or procedure are inflating slower or faster \u2013 as medical expenditures are more sensitive to the NUMBER of procedures performed or pills popped.\n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Indexed Health Care Expenditures (blue line) vs Indexed Personal Income (red line)\n\nIn the 21st century \u2013 health care expenditures for Joe and Jane Sixpack have been taking more and more of their income. It just keeps growing at about the same rate. Unfortunately, income is not growing at the rate of medical expenditures.\n\nWorse, Figure 3 is AVERAGE personal income (influenced heavily by the 0.1%). Here is the same data set for health care expenditures versus MEDIAN income.\n\nFigure 4- Indexed Health Care Expenditures (red line) vs Indexed Personal MEDIAN Income (blue line)\n\nWhether Obamacare eventually starts effecting the rise in medical expenditures or not, a crisis in medical expenditures is already underway. The root causes for the rise in consumer expenditures are yet to be addressed, and may be much more urgent than fixing the defects in Obamacare.\n\nOther Economic News this Week:\n\nThe Econintersect Economic Index for March 2014 is showing a moderate growth deceleration. There are soft data points we watch outside of our index which bears watching. Nothing at this time is pointing to real economic contraction, but there is enough data sets in the warning track to let you know that the economy is far from running on all cylinders.\n\nThe ECRI WLI growth index value has been weakly in positive territory for over four months \u2013 but in a noticeable improvement trend. The index is indicating the economy six month from today will be slightly better than it is today.\n\nCurrent ECRI WLI Growth Index\n\n/images/z weekly_indexes.PNG\n\nInitial unemployment claims went from 336,000 (reported last week) to 348,000 this week. Historically, claims exceeding 400,000 per week usually occur when employment gains are less than the workforce growth, resulting in an increasing unemployment rate. The real gauge \u2013 the 4 week moving average \u2013 marginally worsened from 338,250 (reported last week as 338,500) to 338,250. Because of the noise (week-to-week movements from abnormal events AND the backward revisions to previous weeks releases), the 4-week average remains the reliable gauge.\n\nWeekly Initial Unemployment Claims \u2013 4 Week Average \u2013 Seasonally Adjusted \u2013 2011 (red line), 2012 (green line), 2013 (blue line), 2014 (orange line)\n\n/images/z unemployment.PNG\n\nBankruptcies this Week: Cayman Islands-based Suntech Power Holdings Co.\n\nWeekly Economic Release Scorecard:", "article_metadata": {"google-site-verification": "81mKPeNoK2AdXUzIIgladUq0VieusTnqUAUxuRpnjes", "blogcatalog": "9BC9564332", "description": "A new economics based website.
