A seventh, Connecticut, extended the deadline until Friday for those who started the process by Monday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdding to call volume in Massachusetts: Monday was the first day consumers could make changes to applications. They needed to call customer service to ask that their accounts be unlocked. Before Monday, only those with a major life change affecting their ability to qualify for assistance \u2014 a job loss, for instance \u2014 could make alterations.\n\nMeanwhile, by Sunday, 180,844 people had used the Connector website to determine the coverage for which they were eligible. Of them, 84,019 were enrolled in MassHealth, the state\u2019s Medicaid program. The rest needed to select private insurance on the Connector, and 41,757 \u2014 43 percent \u2014 had taken that crucial step by Sunday night.\n\nThe Connector did not have up-to-date numbers on how many people had taken the final step necessary to enroll and pay the first month\u2019s premiums. By the middle of last week, 6,989 had paid, representing 8.7 percent of those deemed eligible for coverage.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing enrollments start to increase the way we envisioned,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cI would imagine we\u2019re going to see many more payments this week.\u201d\n\nSusan Feinberg, a self-employed consultant in West Dennis, said she has paid for her health insurance but still can\u2019t determine with certainty whether she will be covered.\n\nA cancer survivor who recently started her own business, she said she is grateful that state and federal laws ensure that she can buy insurance despite her health history. But she\u2019s also anxious to make sure there is no gap in her coverage.\n\nThe 55-year-old said she chose a plan Nov. 18 but never received a bill, despite requesting one and calling to follow up when it didn\u2019t arrive. When she realized she could pay online, she did. But, unnervingly, the website did not confirm receipt.\n\nOn Dec. 10, the premium was withdrawn from her checking account. But when she called the insurance company, it had no information about her. \u201cThey way they\u2019re set up, no one can reassure me that, yes, I will be covered on Jan. 1,\u201d Feinberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s so frustrating. I did everything right. I did it early. . . . Right now, it\u2019s causing me so much stress.\u201d\n\nRichard Pask of North Truro is another anxious customer. He was among the 10 percent of applicants who needed to submit additional information to verify their identity and citizenship. When that process was completed, he said, he had to mail in his property tax bill \u2014 twice \u2014 to verify his residency. Finally, he selected a plan. But Pask said he never received an invoice and cannot find out his account number.\n\nPask said that a call center representative advised him to mail in the check, even though he doesn\u2019t have an account number. He plans to do so, but he\u2019s worried it won\u2019t be credited to the right account in time.\n\n\u201cCome Dec. 24, if they say, \u2018You didn\u2019t get your check in time,\u2019 I\u2019m going to have no recourse,\u201d Pask said. \u201cThey say everything\u2019s going swell. It\u2019s not going swimmingly for me.\u201d\n\nThe Connector\u2019s Cohen said that, despite a smattering of such complaints on social media, there were no widespread billing delays. But completing the process takes time, he said.\n\nDell, the company handling the billing, needs to verify consumers\u2019 information, withdraw money from their bank accounts, and communicate with the insurance company \u2014 meaning it can take seven to 10 days between placing a payment and receiving an insurance card.\n\nConsumers paying online need to go to Dell\u2019s website to process the payment. Some found this frustrating because Dell then asks for account numbers available only on the Connector website. Cohen urged consumers to keep the Connector page up in one tab and open Dell in a separate tab.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.0.800441267", "eomportal-id": 228641, "description": "A deluge of phone calls greeted the Massachusetts Health Connector on the one-month anniversary of its new website Monday, mostly \u2014 officials said \u2014 from people misinformed about the deadline to buy insurance.
