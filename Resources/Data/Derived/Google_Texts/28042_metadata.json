Eric Piermont/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPredicting modest growth for the country in 2015, U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas Donohue on Wednesday denounced excessive regulation and called for bipartisan cooperation among lawmakers to further boost the U.S. economy and labor market.\n\nThe U.S. is in its greatest period of job growth since 2006, and the economy will likely improve \u201cmoderately\u201d this year following signs of increased hiring, bolstered consumer spending and a housing sector that \u201ccontinues to improve in fits and starts,\u201d Donohue said during a speech laying out his group\u2019s policy priorities for the next year.\n\nBut the country is \u201cnot out of the woods yet,\u201d he warned, citing a recent Labor Department report showing 17.7 million Americans are unemployed or underemployed, and that the 62.7 percent labor participation rate is the lowest since 1978.\n\n\u201cThe chamber expects to see growth at 3 percent to 3.5 percent at least through the middle of the year,\u201d Donohue said. \u201cInterest rates, energy prices and inflation should remain low for the time being. There's no reason to think that another recession is lurking out there on the near-term horizon.\u201d\n\n[READ: Economy Ends 2014 Adding 252,000 Jobs in December]\n\nHoping Congress will move past progressive and conservative leanings, Donohue called on lawmakers to find a \u201cgoverning center\u201d that would help them \u201cget things done\u201d to improve the economy.\n\nThe chamber has sided with Republicans in pushing for approval of the proposed $5.4 billion Keystone XL pipeline extension from Canada to the U.S. and has called for changes to the Dodd-Frank Act regulating Wall Street, so the group has high ambitions for the new Republican majority during this session of Congress.\n\nThe U.S. economic outlook is less optimistic in the long term due to slowing growth in China and the potential of a recession in Japan, Donohue said. But boosting international trade is a major pillar of the chamber\u2019s agenda, so the group has supported President Barack Obama\u2019s move to normalize relations with Cuba and his efforts to increase trade with China.\n\n\u201cNinety-five percent of the people we want to sell something to live outside the United States,\u201d Donohue said.\n\n[MORE: Cheap Oil Isn't Great News for Everyone]\n\nFearing that regulations like the Affordable Care Act will add potentially burdensome health care expenses to businesses, Donohue said the chamber will continue to push to remove fines mandated by the act, including the medical device tax. Donohue also said the chamber will support any chance of tax reform, but not if it would lead to increased taxes on businesses.\n\n\u201cSome 4,000 new regulations will pour out of the regulatory pipeline this year,\u201d he said. \u201cSuccessful financial regulatory reform can't be measured by the sheer number of new regulations or the size of the fines extracted from financial firms.\u201d\n\nCiting the tech sector and the Internet as major drivers of U.S. growth, Donohue said the chamber\u2019s new Center for Advanced Technology and Innovation will spearhead an effort to \u201cdefend technology companies and advance their policy interests\u201d around the world. Supporting the tech industry matches the chamber\u2019s call to ease immigration restrictions to attract foreign workers.\n\n\u201cIt is in the best interests of both parties to act [on immigration] before the next election,\u201d he said.\n\n[MORE: Why 2015 Is a Great Year to Travel to Europe]\n\nThe chamber opposes net neutrality rules being proposed by the Federal Communications Commission, which is expected to vote on a proposal next month. Net neutrality on principle aims to ensure all websites can compete and have equal access to Internet speeds, but Republicans broadly claim new FCC rules would discourage investment in the tech sector by adding regulatory uncertainty.\n\nRecent hacks of companies like Sony Pictures Entertainment and JPMorgan Chase also highlight the vulnerability of business networks and the need for cybersecurity legislation. Obama on Tuesday discussed his proposal for legislation to boost cybersecurity enforcement, including a bill that would ease data-sharing lability and enable companies to better collaborate with the government on network threats.\n\n\u201cWe are calling for the Congress to pass a new cybersecurity information-sharing bill without delay,\u201d Donohue said.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "U.S. Chamber of Commerce", "title": "U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Calls for Cooperation in 2015", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "In his State of American Business address, the group's president calls for less regulation, more trade.", "title": "U.S. Chamber Calls for Cooperation to Boost Economy in 2015", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/01/14/us-chamber-of-commerce-president-calls-for-cooperation-in-2015", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/db/3a/7cdebd194460a0471c676b4e43cc/150114-donahue-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In his State of American Business address, the group's president calls for less regulation, more trade.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Calls for Cooperation in 2015"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Jan. 14, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Tom Risen,Pulse,picks,business,economy,U.S. Chamber of Commerce", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "In his State of American Business address, the group's president calls for less regulation, more trade."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb4f7\"", "article_summary": "The U.S. economy is expected to \"moderately\" improve in 2015, U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas Donohue says.\nEric Piermont/AFP/Getty ImagesPredicting modest growth for the country in 2015, U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas Donohue on Wednesday denounced excessive regulation and called for bipartisan cooperation among lawmakers to further boost the U.S. economy and labor market.\n\u201cThe chamber expects to see growth at 3 percent to 3.5 percent at least through the middle of the year,\u201d Donohue said.\nDonohue also said the chamber will support any chance of tax reform, but not if it would lead to increased taxes on businesses.\n\u201cWe are calling for the Congress to pass a new cybersecurity information-sharing bill without delay,\u201d Donohue said."}
