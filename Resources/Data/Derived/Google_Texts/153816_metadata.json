He was recently killed in the uncreatively named series \u201cThe Death of Wolverine.\u201d\n\nThe question: When will he be brought back, and in how ridiculous a manner?\n\nDeath in comic books is notoriously silly, a stunt used to grab publicity and spike sales. Sure, some comic deaths are sacred\u2014like Bruce Wayne\u2019s parents and Peter Parker\u2019s Uncle Ben\u2014but they weren\u2019t superheroes. Most superhero deaths are as temporary as a rash. Even if you\u2019re dead for decades\u2014like the Flash and Bucky\u2014your return is assured. This is probably the best reason to be a superhero. If you don the spandex and sell enough comics, you\u2019re pretty much guaranteed immortality.\n\nIn recognition of Wolverine\u2019s inevitable return and the crass and goofy tradition of superhero deaths and resurrections, here\u2019s a look at some of the most preposterous demises and returns ever, which include clones, magic guns, alternate realities and brain-swapping octobots.\n\nPhoenix\n\nAfter \u201cX-Men 137,\u201d this would have been the death least likely to be considered ridiculous. Jean Grey bravely sacrificed her life so the Phoenix force couldn\u2019t possess her anymore. That was a reasonable, wise decision: during one possession, Jean wiped out an inhabited planet. If genocide and suicide sound a little heavy for superhero comics, you\u2019re right, but back in the \u201980s, Chris Claremont and John Byrne could do little wrong on this engrossing and popular series. The death of Jean Grey was one of the noblest things that ever happened in comics, and also one of the most tragic. So, of course, Marvel reversed it, coming up with a cockamamie explanation that the Jean Grey who died wasn\u2019t the real Jean Grey, who had been napping in an undersea cocoon all this time. By the hammer of Thor, this was bad. To add insult to inanity, Jean has died again since then.\n\nRobin\n\nThe death of the second Robin\u2014Jason Todd\u2014is unique to say the least. Though he was beaten with a crowbar, and then blown up, by the Joker in \u201cDeath in the Family,\u201d the true perpetrators were fans. DC had phone lines set up where fans could decide whether or not to kill the unpopular character, and they voted for death. No elections were held regarding the inevitable return of Jason Todd, which occurred thanks to DC\u2019s most commonly used resurrection McGuffin, the Lazarus Pit.\n\nBucky\n\nCaptain America\u2019s World War II partner Bucky Barnes was long considered one of those deaths you couldn\u2019t/shouldn\u2019t reverse\u2013until Ed Brubaker and Steve Epting\u2019s remarkable run on Cap. Their revival story was elaborate, but not cheap. It turns out Bucky was found by the Russians after he plummeted from the exploding plane that also sent Captain America into the drink. Bucky was resuscitated, brainwashed, given a metal arm and used to carry out assassinations throughout the Cold War. Between missions, he went back on ice to preserve his youthful looks and girlish figure. This story was the basis of \u201cCaptain America: The Winter Soldier,\u201d which I reckon is one of the three best superhero flicks ever. The return of Bucky is a rarity: a great story rather than a desperate stunt.\n\nInvincible\n\nIssue 99 of \u201cInvincible\u201d is an enormous brawl between the title character and his nemesis/partner Dinosaurus: an absurdly named lizard-type villain who just melted some glaciers in an attempt to flood the world and reduce the population to a number healthier for the planet. On page 1 of issue 100, Dinosaurus smushes Invincible\u2019s head. On page 2, he rips Invincible\u2019s body in half. (FYI, these gross acts are drawn in typically amazing, gory style by Ryan Ottley.) How did Invincible survive that? Through a time-worn gimmick: Dinosaurus actually killed a clone. When in doubt, break glass, use clone.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the superhero world, just because your body was ripped in half doesn't mean you can't make a comeback", "title": "The spandex-clad undead: Why comics love ridiculous resurrections", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In the superhero world, just because your body was ripped in half doesn't mean you can't make a comeback", "title": "The spandex-clad undead: Why comics love ridiculous resurrections", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/08/the_spandex_clad_undead_why_comics_love_ridiculous_resurrections/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/batman_robin.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In the superhero world, just because your body was ripped in half doesn't mean you can't make a comeback", "title": "The spandex-clad undead: Why comics love ridiculous resurrections", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/batman_robin.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mark Peters", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Batman, Comics, Death, resurrections", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Batman, Comics, Death, resurrections, Entertainment NewsIf you\u2019re not up on your comic plots, I have some bad news: Wolverine is dead.\nSo, of course, Marvel reversed it, coming up with a cockamamie explanation that the Jean Grey who died wasn\u2019t the real Jean Grey, who had been napping in an undersea cocoon all this time.\nIf you don the spandex and sell enough comics, you\u2019re pretty much guaranteed immortality.\nIf genocide and suicide sound a little heavy for superhero comics, you\u2019re right, but back in the \u201980s, Chris Claremont and John Byrne could do little wrong on this engrossing and popular series.\nThe death of Jean Grey was one of the noblest things that ever happened in comics, and also one of the most tragic."}
