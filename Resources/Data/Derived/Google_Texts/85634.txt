"There is a link with the Paris attacks but for now we have to let the Belgian police do their job and complete the operation, which is ongoing," Hollande told reporters after an EU summit.

"We don't have confirmation at the moment, and all information that is premature would go counter to what we are trying to do ... to arrest and neutralize this individual."

Belgian media reported that Salah Abdeslam had been wounded and caught by police in an operation on Friday afternoon in the Brussels quarter of Molenbeek.
