Other legislation addresses the Second Amendment, the federal prohibition of hemp and marijuana, common core, the use of drones for surveillance, the Affordable Care Act, and even federal grant programs that arm local police with battlefield-ready military equipment.\n\nTenth Amendment Center founder and executive director Michael Boldin said the sheer number of bills indicates just how mainstream state action to block federal power has become.\n\n\u201cThis is unprecedented,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom mass spying, to gun control, property rights, militarized police, the drug war and everything in between, we\u2019ve never seen so much activity to push back on a state level.\u201d\n\nSome say all of this state action merely represents a right-wing movement and backlash against President Obama. Boldin bristles at this notion.\n\n\u201cThe great misconception is that this is a right-wing movement that is trying to oppose federal power,\u201d he said. \u201cWith some issues, like the Second Amendment and the ACA, that\u2019s certainly true, But we\u2019re tracking more than 200 bills, and many of the most successful \u2013 like marijuana, hemp farming, \u201cright to try\u201d bills, and stopping NSA spying \u2013 lean strongly left or are totally bipartisan. Anyone claiming this is a partisan fad is either not paying attention, or lying.\u201d\n\nA broader understanding of the legal basis many of these bills rest on also helped spur the movement. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the anti-commandeering doctrine, a legal principle declaring that the federal government cannot require or force states to expend resources or manpower to help it carry out its acts or programs.\n\n\u201cState governments are learning they can simply say to the feds, \u2018You want this program, you do it, we aren\u2019t going to help,'\u201d Boldin said. \u201cThe beauty of this strategy is in many situations, the feds just don\u2019t have the manpower or resources to get the job done without help from the states. They depend on the states for pretty much everything,\u201d\n\nBoldin said the states have the power to virtually shut down most federal programs within their borders simply by saying, \u201cNo!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe generally call these acts nullification. Some disagree. But we don\u2019t really care what you call it, though, as long as the end result is the same \u2013 stopping the federal government from doing things they shouldn\u2019t be doing,\u201d he said.\n\nMost state legislative sessions for 2015 just got underway in January, with others states starting in the coming weeks.
