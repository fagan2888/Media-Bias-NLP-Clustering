Diagnoses likely to cause a drop from MCC status include hepatic encephalopathy, sepsis and acute respiratory failure, according to The Advisory Board.\n\nIn one example of how greater detail can drive a change in payment, in a patient coded for hepatic encephalopathy, only the presence of a coma will uphold MCC status for the ICD-10 code.\n\nThe ICD-9 code for hepatic encephalopathy includes no detail about coma status.\n\nThe difference in reimbursement is $2,800, according to the authors.\n\nLike Healthcare Finance on Facebook\n\nSome downgrades are due to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid reevaluating severity levels. For example, an ICD-9 diagnosis code 4010, malignant hypertension, no longer confers MCC status and has been downgraded to the lower CC severity tier, which is reimbursed at a lower amount.\n\nFor example, extracranial procedures with CC under ICD-9 reimbursed at $9,270. But under ICD-10, according to the authors, it has been downgraded to extracranial procedures without CC/MCC, and reimburses at $6,320.\n\n\"This example highlights the vulnerability of cases where a single secondary code is the sole reason for an MCC or CC status,\" the authors said. \"Comprehensive documentation can provide a coder with additional details that may support coding for MCC status where appropriate.\"\n\nTwitter: @SusanMorseHFN", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/coding-productivity-new-secondary-diagnoses-could-cost-healthcare-big-after-icd-10", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/medical-record-feature.png", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "As ICD-10 approaches, healthcare providers are worried that lapses in coder productivity could cost them money, according to an Advisory Board Company report published Tuesday.", "title": "Coding productivity, new secondary diagnoses, could cost healthcare big after ICD-10"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/medical-record-feature.png"}, "title": "Coding productivity, new secondary diagnoses, could cost healthcare big after ICD-10", "description": "As ICD-10 approaches, healthcare providers are worried that lapses in coder productivity could cost them money, according to an Advisory Board Company report published Tuesday.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "As ICD-10 approaches, healthcare providers are worried that lapses in coder productivity could cost them money, according to an Advisory Board Company report published Tuesday.&#13; Providers refer to a 50 percent initial drop in productivity when Canada moved to ICD-10 in 2003, said the Advisory Board, citing a study done by Humber River Regional Hospital in Ontario.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "As ICD-10 approaches, healthcare providers are worried that lapses in coder productivity could cost them money, according to an Advisory Board Company report published Tuesday.\n\"Comprehensive documentation can provide a coder with additional details that may support coding for MCC status where appropriate.\"\nDiagnoses likely to cause a drop from MCC status include hepatic encephalopathy, sepsis and acute respiratory failure, according to The Advisory Board.\nProviders refer to a 50 percent initial drop in productivity when Canada moved to ICD-10 in 2003, said the Advisory Board, citing a study done by Humber River Regional Hospital in Ontario.\n[Also: Top ICD-10 stories you don't want to miss]Unfortunately, in a study it released earlier this summer, the Advisory Board found greater specificity can lead to payment reductions."}
