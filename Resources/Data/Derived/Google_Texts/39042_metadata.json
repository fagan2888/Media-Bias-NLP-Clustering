The new hepatitis C drug is apparently an effective treatment for the debilitating and potentially deadly liver disease. However, Gilead Sciences, Sovaldi\u2019s patent holder, charges $84,000 for a three-month course of treatment.\n\nThere are an estimated 3 million people with hep C in the United States. This puts the tab to treat them at more than $250 billion. That would be a major cost to private insurers and public-sector programs such as Medicaid. This is the basis for the hand wringing: Should we require private insurers to pick up the tab for Sovaldi for hep C sufferers? Does everyone get treated or just the very sick? And should already stretched state Medicaid programs have to bear this additional burden?\n\nThe answers to these questions, however, are much easier for anyone who doesn\u2019t mind bucking the drug companies. Sovaldi is expensive in the U.S. because the government gives Gilead Sciences a patent monopoly on the drug. It uses this monopoly to charge a price that is far above the free-market rate: A generic version is already available in Egypt for $900 per treatment. Indian generic manufacturers believe that they can produce the drug for less than $200.\n\nThis presents a simple and obvious way around the $84,000 problem: Send people to Egypt or India for a treatment that costs 1 percent as much or less. The U.S. could pay for family members to go as well, stay a full three months and still come out tens of thousands of dollars ahead. Certainly this can be presented as an option to people, perhaps throwing in a $5,000 or $10,000 incentive to make the trip worth their while.\n\nThe savings states could net from opting for this solution are enormous. They will all have large numbers of hep C sufferers, many of whom are covered by state Medicaid programs. For example, with a bit less than 12 percent of the country\u2019s population, California, if it has a proportional number of people with hepatitis C, has about 350,000 sufferers. If one-third are on Medicaid and the total cost for treating someone in another country is $20,000, the state could save more than $7 billion by offering the option to be treated abroad. For Texas the potential savings by this calculation would be about $4.8 billion and for New Jersey some $1.7 billion.\n\nThese huge potential savings present a great opportunity for California\u2019s Jerry Brown, Texas\u2019 Rick Perry, New Jersey\u2019s Chris Christie and other governors to show themselves as tough guys who are willing to do what it takes to save taxpayers\u2019 money. That is, unless they are scared to stand up to the drug industry.", "article_metadata": {"description": "States can save money by sending liver-disease sufferers overseas to receive treatment", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/8/patent-hepatitiscsovaldigileadsciencesmedicaid.html", "image": {"width": 1460, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/opinions/2014/8/patent-hepatitiscsovaldigileadsciencesmedicaid/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.sovaldi_080114.1407166151064.jpg", "height": 911}, "type": "article", "description": "States can save money by sending liver-disease sufferers overseas to receive treatment", "title": "OPINION: Patent for hepatitis C drug costs US billions of dollars"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/opinions/2014/8/patent-hepatitiscsovaldigileadsciencesmedicaid/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.sovaldi_080114.1407166151064.jpg", "description": "States can save money by sending liver-disease sufferers overseas to receive treatment", "site": "@AJAM", "card": "summary", "title": "OPINION: Patent for hepatitis C drug costs US billions of dollars"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Pharmaceuticals, Medicare & Medicaid, Medical Industry, Economy, Health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdae40\"", "article_summary": "The new hepatitis C drug is apparently an effective treatment for the debilitating and potentially deadly liver disease.\nThey will all have large numbers of hep C sufferers, many of whom are covered by state Medicaid programs.\nThere are an estimated 3 million people with hep C in the United States.\nThis is the basis for the hand wringing: Should we require private insurers to pick up the tab for Sovaldi for hep C sufferers?\nAnd should already stretched state Medicaid programs have to bear this additional burden?"}
