Persistent to the end, he received the galleys of his final article just a few days before he died of cancer in his Cambridge home early Tuesday, on his 91st birthday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring more than a dozen years editing the New England Journal, he expanded the reach of the august research publication and made it a forum where a rapidly evolving field\u2019s top writers debated the day\u2019s most important economic, ethical, and public policy issues.\n\n\u201cWe should not allow the medical-\n\nindustrial complex to distort our health care system to its own entrepreneurial ends,\u201d he wrote in an early editorial. The response in the health care world was mixed, with some praising Dr. Relman and others suggesting he did not grasp the market forces at work.\n\nDr. Jerome Kassirer, who succeeded Dr. Relman as editor and is now a distinguished professor at the Tufts University School of Medicine, said that \u201cby publishing an enormous number of important studies of the health care system, he helped to formulate the debate. In his time, there were no other strong sources that you could go to for discussion of these issues. The New England Journal was it.\u201d\n\nDr. Relman began editing the Journal in 1977, and wrote elsewhere, too, particularly after becoming editor emeritus. He and his wife, Dr. Marcia Angell, received a 2002 George Polk Award for their New Republic article that examined how pharmaceutical companies spend more of their profits on advertising and lobbying than on drug research and development.\n\nGEORGE RIZER/Globe Staff/File 1996 Dr. Arnold Relman in 1986.\n\nIn February, he published a piercing account in the New York Review of Books about what happened when he fell in his home 10 days after his 90th birthday and nearly died after breaking his neck. As he recovered, Relman wrote he \u201clearned some things about the US medical care system that I had never fully appreciated, even though this is a subject that I have studied and written about for many years.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis article had enormous readership and was much admired,\u201d said Robert Silvers, editor of the New York Review of Books. \u201cHe wrote it under extreme conditions and I admired tremendously his vision of medicine, his spirit in writing about it, and his stoicism about what happened to him.\u201d\n\nDr. Relman and Angell, who was also the former top editor of the Journal, were in many ways Boston\u2019s preeminent power couple in medical circles, celebrated for their intellect, their writing, and their clear affection for one another.\n\n\u201cHe believed in medicine as primarily a profession where doctors and patients make their decisions without any financial incentives other than to do what was best medically for the patients, a bold philosophy,\u201d said Angell, who added, \u201cI will miss him more than I can possibly say.\u201d\n\nA respected researcher and professor early in his career, and a professor emeritus of medicine and of social medicine at Harvard Medical School at the end, Dr. Relman in the late 1970s helped launch what became the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, which makes recommendations about conduct, reporting, and editing.\n\n\u201cHe was really an extraordinary editor,\u201d said Robert Kuttner, a longtime friend who wrote for Dr. Relman at the Journal and later became cofounder and coeditor of The American Prospect. \u201cHe was also an utter gentleman. He was a mentor, he was courtly, he was courteous, and he never lorded his extraordinary knowledge over anybody.\u201d\n\nFounded in 1812, the New England Journal of Medicine is the oldest continuously published medical journal in the world and is owned by the Massachusetts Medical Society. After Dr. Relman became editor, circulation increased and profits soared. Along with continuing the journal\u2019s influential role publishing research findings, he made it a forum for exploring economic and social issues in medicine, such as health care rationing and ethics.\n\nDuring his tenure, the publication was the first medical journal to require authors to disclose potential conflicts of interest if they owned stock in biomedical companies when they published research that might benefit those firms.\n\n\u201cHe demanded just total perfection in every detail,\u201d said Tad Campion, senior deputy editor and online editor of the Journal. \u201cWhen it came to the controversial issues, and especially matters of health care and ethics, he was absolutely tenacious and fearless in saying what he believed, and spoke with the power and the certainty of an Old Testament prophet.\u201d\n\nThe younger of two children, Arnold S. Relman grew up in Far Rockaway, in Queens, N.Y. His sister, Dr. Muriel Straetz, was a psychiatrist and died last year. Their mother, Rose, was a cellist who in later years organized a tenants association. Their father, Simon, was known as Sam. A businessman, he read constantly and inspired his son\u2019s love of philosophy, which Dr. Relman studied as an undergraduate at Cornell University.\n\nDr. Relman\u2019s mother called him Buddy and, disliking Arnold, he went by Bud the rest of his life, using his nickname as a filter for callers. Anyone who asked for Arnold, he surmised, did not really know him.\n\nSkipping grades in his youth, he graduated from Cornell at 19 and was 22 when he received a medical degree from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.\n\nHe arrived in Boston in 1949 as a National Research Council fellow in medical sciences at Boston University School of Medicine. Joining the faculty two years later, he became the Conrad Wesselhoeft professor of medicine and edited the Journal of Clinical Investigation. In 1968, he moved to the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, where he was the Frank Wister Thomas professor of medicine and chaired the Department of Medicine.\n\nIn 1953, Dr. Relman married Harriet Vitkin, with whom he had three children. Their marriage ended in divorce 40 years later. \u201cHe was a wonderful father,\u201d said their son Dr. David Relman of Palo Alto, Calif. \u201cHe was an incredible role model in so many ways and did it in a fashion that never felt imposed. He was just the kind of person who was inspiring to be around, even as a kid.\u201d\n\nDr. Relman returned to Boston in 1977 to become the New England Journal of Medicine\u2019s top editor. Eleven years later, when the Affordable Care Act still sat far beyond the horizon, Dr. Relman told the Globe that \u201cwe\u2019ll have to have some kind of federal umbrella for health care \u2014 some kind of nationally subsidized health insurance system. We\u2019ll have no peace, no equity, until we get some kind of system in place.\u201d\n\nDr. Relman met Angell when she was a student at Boston University School of Medicine who sought his advice on a student project. That led to their first scholarly collaboration, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1968. She joined the Journal\u2019s staff in 1979 and later served as executive editor until, in 1999, she was the first woman to be named editor.\n\nA couple for 20 years, Dr. Relman and Angell married in 2009. \u201cFive years ago he said, \u2018They\u2019re having a special at Cambridge City Hall,\u2019 \u201d she recalled with a laugh, and they were married by a justice of the peace, but only after each edited the boilerplate civil marriage text to next to nothing. \u201cBud and I both had a terse style of writing: the shorter the better.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his wife and son, Dr. Relman leaves another son, John of Washington, D.C.; a daughter, Margaret Batten of West Newton; two stepdaughters, Dr. Lara Goitein of Santa Fe, and Elizabeth Goitein of Washington; six granddaughters; and four step-grandsons.\n\nA private gathering for family and friends will be announced.\n\nDiagnosed in January with aggressive melanoma, Dr. Relman chose to keep working until his final days.\n\n\u201cWhen he found he had a fatal illness, he said, \u2018I just want to die the way I lived, sitting at my desk writing,\u2019 \u201d Angell said. \u201cHe was dignified and brave the whole time. He said, \u2018Look, I got 90, maybe 91 years. Not many people get that. I\u2019ve had a wonderful life and I have no regrets.\u2019 \u201d\n\nRelated:\n\n\u2022 Dr. Arnold Relman on becoming the patient\n\n\u2022 New England Journal of Medicine\u2019s most surprising, groundbreaking events\n\n\u2022 Journal celebrates 200 years of service\n\n\u2022 Special section: The Mass. health care law", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.2.4269353241", "eomportal-id": 507591, "description": "Dr. Arnold Relman, who as editor of the New England Journal of Medicine took an august research publication and expanded its philosophical reach to make it a forum where a rapidly evolving field\u2019s most intricate financial and ethical debates were argued, died early Tuesday morning on his 91st birthday.", "eomportal-instanceid": 14, "og": {"city": "Boston", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "Dr. Arnold Relman, who as editor of the New England Journal of Medicine took an august research publication and expanded its philosophical reach to make it a forum where a rapidly evolving field\u2019s most intricate financial and ethical debates were argued, died early Tuesday morning on his 91st birthday.", "title": "Dr. Arnold Relman, 91; former New England Journal of Medicine editor was a forceful voice in health care debate - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/06/17/arnold-relman-former-new-england-journal-medicine-editor-was-forceful-voice-health-care-debate/k4Flrz8z2xgWyilyMB555I/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2014/06/17/BostonGlobe.com/Metro/Images/Arnold%20Relman%202-1346911.jpg", "longitude": "-71.0597732", "state": "MA", "latitude": "42.3584308", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "Dr. Arnold Relman,Dr. Marcia Angell,New England Journal of Medicine,New York Review of Books,Boston University School of Medicine, Marcia Angell, Robert  Silvers, Robert  Kuttner, Arnold S  Relman,New England Journal of Medicine", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Thu May 26 19:33:08 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "Dr. Arnold Relman,Dr. Marcia Angell,New England Journal of Medicine,New York Review of Books,Boston University School of Medicine, Marcia Angell, Robert  Silvers, Robert  Kuttner, Arnold S  Relman,New England Journal of Medicine, Tufts University, New Republic, New York Review of Books, Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts Medical Society, Cornell University, Columbia University, College of Physicians, National Research Council, Boston University, University of Pennsylvania, City Hall, Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "704f6530-f61f-11e3-96f2-8f55f80d122e"}, "article_summary": "Dr. Relman also was one of the nation\u2019s foremost writers about the rising cost of health care.\nThe New England Journal was it.\u201dDr. Relman began editing the Journal in 1977, and wrote elsewhere, too, particularly after becoming editor emeritus.\nThe response in the health care world was mixed, with some praising Dr. Relman and others suggesting he did not grasp the market forces at work.\nThat led to their first scholarly collaboration, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1968.\n\u201cWe should not allow the medical-industrial complex to distort our health care system to its own entrepreneurial ends,\u201d he wrote in an early editorial."}
