At the price that it's at, we can't give it to everyone, so let's make sure we prioritize this.'\u201d\n\nMedicaid directors, as well as private insurance company executives, have for decades made decisions about what to cover and for whom.\n\nThat's not new, but Sovaldi is different both because of its high price\u2014$84,000 for a 12-week treatment\u2014and because the majority of people with Hepatitis C are on some type of government insurance, putting the burden to pay for the drug on taxpayers. And thanks to Obamacare's expanded Medicaid program, more people than ever will be eligible for a drug everyone wants but no one can afford.\n\nSalo expects that states will have to choose which patients are sick enough to receive treatment.\n\nShould it be patients with stage-four liver damage? Stage three?\n\nAnd if a line is drawn, and states refuse treatment to some until their liver is in worse shape, is it ethical?\n\n\u201cI think rationing, which is what people are talking about doing, is not an ethical and viable approach,\u201d said Brian Edlin, an associate professor of public health and medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College and a senior principal investigator at the Institute for Infectious Disease Research at the National Development and Research Institutes.\n\nImagine, he said, telling people they have an infection but they have to wait until their liver is really shot before they can be treated.\n\n\u201cThat, to me, is, I don't know the word to describe it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's just horrendous.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that at the end of this month, an advisory committee of physicians will consider a recommendation by Oregon Medicaid staff to narrow the eligibility criteria to include only patients with stage-four fibrosis, the point at which liver damage starts to become irreversible, or cirrhosis. State officials say that treating all 1,450 Oregon Medicaid beneficiaries would cost $160 million.\n\nIt would cost California $6.7 billion to treat its Medicaid population. A state panel recommended giving Sovaldi to those with advanced disease but delay it for others.\n\nPolitics will naturally play into these calculations, and in fact it already has. States that have expanded their Medicaid programs are on the hook to treat more patients.\n\nNew York has a history of offering generous Medicaid benefits and if it chooses to serve a greater number of Hep-C patients, it could attract people from less generous states.\n\nThe true cost of Sovaldi is tough to figure. For starters, sick people are less productive than healthy people and that can have a long-term impact on the economy. And liver transplants can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nLike dealing with a leaky roof or malfunctioning brakes, long-term maintenance can be far more expensive than fixing it right the first time.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal cited a report from PricewaterhouseCoopers, which predicted a spending increase in the first two years but lowered costs over the next half-decade as older treatments are rendered unnecessary.\n\nThen, there is the fact that of the estimated 3.2 million Hep-C patients, only about half know they are infected, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of those who do know they are infected, many may choose to avoid treatment, at least for a bit, Edlin said.\n\nWhat we are talking about, Edlin said, is spending $50 billion over five years, a far more affordable proposition.\n\n\"The answer is not rationing,\" he said.\"Rationing is the most irrational answer to the problem. That's just saying the drug companies can have what they want and the payers can spend what they want and the patients can die. It's outrageous that's the way this thing is going.\"\n\nThere has been some talk about negotiating with Gilead for a better price. Florida got a small discount on the drug. And other states may well follow suit. But the incentives to reach a deal are not in the taxpayers' favor.\n\nFirst, Gilead knows that, for now, it has a monopoly. The state must buy the drug and there is no competition.\n\nSecond, Gilead knows the window to make money could be small.\n\n\u201cOn some level the manufacturers have to be thinking about the long range on this,\u201d Salo said. \u201cAnd because there is this public health push to eradicate a public health scourge, these companies know if all goes well the market for these drug goes away. Their window to make back their research and development money is fairly narrow.\u201d\n\nFinally, Salo said, Gilead knows that wherever the state draws a line, the patients on the wrong side can sue.\n\nLast month, three Arkansas Medicaid recipients suffering from Cystic Fibrosis sued the state when Medicaid refused to pay for a $300,000 treatment.\n\n\u201cThere is a public health sense we should be covering everyone,\u201d Salo said. \u201cGilead knows that at the end of the day, to the extent lines get drawn and people are on the wrong side of the line, they will sue and when the courts get involved they will win.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2014/07/8549620/sovaldi-dilemma", "image": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/sites/default/files/a%20-%20Sovaldi_2.png", "type": "article", "title": "The Sovaldi dilemma"}, "robots": "all", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Sarah Palin's"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbb6d\"", "article_summary": "Sovaldi, the breakthrough Hep-C drug from Gilead Sciences, has focused the nation's attention on that uncomfortable truth.\n\u201cAnd because there is this public health push to eradicate a public health scourge, these companies know if all goes well the market for these drug goes away.\n\"Not just Sovaldi, but they are thinking of other high cost drugs that are out there.\"\n\u201cThere is a public health sense we should be covering everyone,\u201d Salo said.\nA state panel recommended giving Sovaldi to those with advanced disease but delay it for others."}
