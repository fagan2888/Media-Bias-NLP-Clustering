The three were accused of sexually assaulting her in the backyard of their Oak Street home in the Bradley Gardens section of the township after a party, then killing her.\n\nWilson pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to 45 years in prison. DiTaranto pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit aggravated sexual assault.\n\nKatharine Errickson, Granskie\u2019s lawyer, concluded her 3 \u00bd-hour summation Tuesday morning in Superior Court Judge Robert Reed\u2019s packed courtroom. Somerset County Assistant Prosecutor Timothy Van Hise finished his summation before the lunch break and Reed began to deliver the 45 pages of jury instructions in the afternoon.\n\nVan Hise argued that the jury should not accept the defense\u2019s claim that Granskie\u2019s confession was caused by his withdrawal from heroin.\n\nVan Hise said the jury should study the DVD of the confession made to Bridgewater police detectives and determine if they can see signs of Granskie\u2019s \u201cdistress\u201d during the questioning.\n\nVan Hise discounted the testimony of Dr. Clarence Watson, a defense expert on false confessions, who pointed to Granskie\u2019s runny nose during the interrogation as a sign of withdrawal.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the evidence other than other than Dr. Watson pointing out the sniffles?\u201d Van Hise asked the jury, adding that Granskie did not show signs of \u201csignificant physical distress\u201d either at Bridgewater Police Headquarters or the Somerset County Jail.\n\nVan Hise also criticized the defense\u2019s contention that Granskie would say anything in order to be released from police custody in order to score heroin.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence that David Granskie\u2019s opioid withdrawal affected his ability to reason,\u201d Van Hise said.\n\nHe pointed to Granskie\u2019s statement, after he gave the confession, that he would be going to jail for the rest of life as an example of Granskie\u2019s \u201cclear, rational and logical\u201d thought.\n\n\u201cIt suggests a reasonable understanding of what he has done,\u201d Van Hise said.\n\nBut Errickson argued that the prosecution had not presented any evidence to corroborate Granskie\u2019s confession.\n\n\u201cWhere is the evidence to show the confession is credible?\u201d she asked the jury. \u201cNo way is it credible.\u201d\n\nErrickson told the jury that no DNA evidence links Granskie to the crime scene.\n\nThe defense attorney said the police and the prosecution \u201ccherry-picked\u201d the evidence. She also said the police had \u201ctunnel vision\u201d in their questioning of Granskie.\n\n\u201cThere is zero physical evidence connecting David Granskie to anything,\u201d she said. \u201cIf that\u2019s not overwhelming reasonable doubt, I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d\n\nErrickson repeated her argument from Monday\u2019s court session that Wilson alone murdered Stone by dropping a cinderblock on her head because she was laughing at him because he could not sustain an erection.\n\n\u201cThis case is simple,\u201d Errickson said. \u201cGary Wilson snapped.\u201d\n\nStaff Writer Mike Deak: 908-243-6607; mdeak@mycentraljersey.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1wiVRqq", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "After more than a month of testimony, jury to decide whether to believe murder confession", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "After more than a month of testimony, jury to decide whether to believe murder confession", "title": "Bridgewater murder trial in hands of jury", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/somerset-county/2014/10/21/bridgewater-murder-trial-hands-jury/17686569/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After more than a month of testimony, jury to decide whether to believe murder confession", "title": "Bridgewater murder trial in hands of jury", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d3b2bed5f8e8b8abbc2d93e13b9f5792ec380533/c=447-0-2553-2106&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Bridgewater/2014/10/21/vanhise.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Bridgewater, murder, Granskie,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9a72\"", "article_summary": "Van Hise argued that the jury should not accept the defense\u2019s claim that Granskie\u2019s confession was caused by his withdrawal from heroin.\n\u201cIt suggests a reasonable understanding of what he has done,\u201d Van Hise said.\n\u201cThere is no evidence that David Granskie\u2019s opioid withdrawal affected his ability to reason,\u201d Van Hise said.\nGranskie, Gary Wilson and Rocky DiTaranto, all Bridgewater residents, were charged with Stone\u2019s murder.\nSomerset County Assistant Prosecutor Timothy Van Hise finished his summation before the lunch break and Reed began to deliver the 45 pages of jury instructions in the afternoon."}
