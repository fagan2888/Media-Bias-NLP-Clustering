A Texas man was stopped at a polling station during early voting Tuesday because of guns—namely, the ones referenced on his t-shirt.

Chris Driskill was on his way to the voting booth when, he said, “I heard a gentleman’s voice over my shoulder say ‘he can’t vote with that shirt on. You’ll have to either turn it inside out our you’ll have to leave.'”

Driskill at first thought that his shirt, which read “2nd Amendment: America’s Original Homeland Security,” had offended the polling workers’ politics. “I didn’t quite understand it at first,” he said. “I was thinking they just didn’t like something about the Second Amendment.”

But he had actually run afoul of a Texas law prohibiting electioneering with 100 feet of a polling place. With a proposition on the ballot about concealed carry, Driskill’s pro-Second Amendment shirt fit the bill.

Driskill was offered a coat by a local Republican candidate standing outside the voting station (one hopes more than 100 feet away) and returned to successfully complete his ballot. “I guess I can kind of see where their reaction came from,” he told KVUE. “If you have to turn around and go change shirts, you know, so be it. But get out and vote.”
