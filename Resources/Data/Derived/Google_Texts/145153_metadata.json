Seems everyone\u2019s going, wants to go or just got back. And while classic American cars and magnificent, crumbling buildings inspire the tourism boom, the Third World island offers a First World bonus: Visitors who get sick here are in good hands.\n\nDuring a 10-day trip to Cuba in January, I never once worried about my health, and I\u2019ve had a kidney transplant and three hip replacements. Given such pre-existing conditions, I have health insurance only thanks to Obamacare. Here, I got a glimpse of Castrocare.\n\nI accompanied my world-famous orthopedic-surgeon uncle to Havana, where we spent an afternoon with his longtime colleague, Dr. Rodrigo Cambras, chief of the Frank Pais Orthopedic Hospital, the largest of its kind in the Americas. Back home, I looked more deeply into the healthcare system the world variously admires and criticizes, so I spoke with Dr. Kari Koch, a Hendersonville internist who earned her tuition-free degree in Cuba, and Dr. Sergio Arce, who now teaches at Greenville\u2019s medical school after defecting from his native Havana.\n\nTogether, the three physicians offer widely divergent and fascinating perspectives on the curious infrastructure that delivers often-impressive results, including its infant-mortality ranking, which falls between the United States and the European Union, according to the World Health Organization. While WHO consistently rates Cuba\u2019s healthcare in the top third globally, the regime\u2019s system is not without problems: chronic shortages of medicines, devices and equipment and money. Moreover, Havana often invites controversy for exporting the doctors it trains.\n\nAs an elder statesman and architect of Cuba\u2019s medical system, Cambras may be one of its biggest beneficiaries. But you wouldn\u2019t know that from his humble home, a tiny, 1,000-square-foot, single-story house a block from the Caribbean.\n\nCambras, 81, is a walking history book straight out of Fidel\u2019s 1959 Revolution. The two played ball together at University of Havana before Cambras joined Cuba\u2019s now-mythologized physician-turned-guerilla Che Guevara in Brazzaville-Congo, where Cambras delivered Africa\u2019s first polio vaccine.\n\nCambras\u2019s squat, pastel-yellow home, with a lush garden in the back, sits in one of Havana\u2019s most fashionable neighborhoods, about 10 minutes from the heart of the dilapidated capital. The home stands as a testament to Cambras\u2019s swashbuckling life, packed with a museum\u2019s worth of mementoes from the 62 countries he has visited: a scimitar from Yemen; a tablecloth from Syria; an eagle-headed cane from a Saudi Arabian prince. Before Castro overthrew Fulgencio Batista, Cambras was jailed three times and was shot in the ankle.\n\nDespite that, he lives comfortably\u2014somehow; physicians here earn $67 a month, up from $26 a month, thanks to a recent raise.\n\nHe shies away from talking politics, though he and his son, also a physician named Rodrigo, decry that US embargo, which they both condemn as \u201cblockade,\u201d a semantic distinction all Cubans make because a blockade, under international law, is considered an act of war.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just a doctor who\u2019s done 10,000 surgeries,\u201d Cambras says, preferring to talk instead about how he fishing, \u201cjust once,\u201d with Ernest Hemingway; how he repaired one of Saddam Hussein\u2019s herniated discs; and how he\u2019s busy planning a major orthopedics conference in September. The meeting will be held at Varadero, the gorgeous white-sand-beach resort area about 85 miles east of Havana.\n\nThe younger Cambras sees the global symposium as a natural extension of long and friendly relations with the American medical community, which, he hopes, will change now that President Obama normalized relations with Cuba last year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working since 1991 to improve the relationship with Cuba and the US,\u201d he says.\n\nMeanwhile, back in the States, Koch and Arce offer decidedly different takes on the regime\u2019s universal healthcare, which is guaranteed in Cuba\u2019s constitution.\n\nKoch, 32, obtained her degree in 2014 from the Latin American School of Medicine, a Cuban government-run behemoth with nearly 20,000 students from 110 countries. Now the internal-medicine resident in Hendersonville, N.C., owes not one penny in student loans.\n\n\u201cI wanted to go to medical school and come out as a family physician without a significant amount of debt that could hinder where you go because you have to go for a job where you\u2019d get paid more,\u201d she says during a 10-minute break in her day at the Mountain Area Health Education Center.\n\nShe\u2019s one of only about 100 Americans who annually attend the school on a scholarship through the New York-based Interreligious Foundation for Community Organization/Pastors for Peace, which encourages graduates to pay their free education forward. Koch serves North Carolina\u2019s apple-growing migrant-farmer community.\n\n\u201cThe quid pro quo is that you come back to the United States and serve people who need medical care,\u201d IFCO spokeswoman Emily Thomas says of the scholarship that demands no formal obligation. \u201cThe Cubans will not come and knock on your door.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re being trained to be a revolutionary doctor. Your goal is to not make as much money as you can but to serve people. It\u2019s a moral commitment, but it\u2019s a very real commitment,\u201d she says.\n\nAfter spending six years in Havana, Koch is sticking to the deal.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s passionate about medicine and social justice,\u201d she says. \u201cThose are the kind of people I wanted to be around. The work in the country there was really interesting, the integration of the school with the public-health system. Everything really appealed to me: learning Spanish, the focus on family medicine.\u201d\n\nNot everyone buys into the economy that hardly compensates its doctors, although it does provide (mostly) free housing and food rations.\n\nSergio Arce is one of them. The Havana-trained physician, who, at 48, is a child of the Revolution, left his hometown in the late \u201990s. He moved to Greenville in 2012 after a six-year stint at Eastern Carolina University in North Carolina. Before that, he worked in Buffalo, NY, and in Europe. He got his American citizenship around the time he moved here as a clinical immunologist on the faculty at University of South Carolina School of Medicine Greenville.\n\n\u201cI got a good medical education, I can\u2019t deny that, and I\u2019ve used it,\u201d Arce says, echoing Koch. \u201cBut since I\u2019ve been out of Cuba for a while, I can say I\u2019ve had a quality improvement of life.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not a stretch to imagine Arce earns more than his colleagues in Cuba do. \u201cEveryone gets paid pretty much the same there,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not only that, but there\u2019s a point in your life where you believe that you need to make a jump. I have experience, and I decided to move out of Cuba. I\u2019m a researcher, and I have a ton more opportunities out of there.\u201d\n\nArce likely would have found himself caught in a practice that has earned Cuba simultaneous praise and criticism for trading its doctors to generate revenues for the country\u2019s chronically cash-strapped treasury. Reuters earlier this year reported that Havana has sent 30,000 medical professionals to Venezuela, its hardcore socialist ally, in exchange for more than 100,000 barrels of oil a day. And reminiscent of Cambras\u2019s anti-polio effort in Africa in 1965, the government sent 256 doctors in 2014 and 2015 to fight Ebola.\n\nAs for fast-thawing relations with the United States, including relaxed travel restrictions that include 110 commercial flights daily now underway to the island, the norteamericano embargo will remain until Congress lifts it. Observers say that\u2019s unlikely any time soon.\n\nThat hits Cuba\u2019s healthcare system particularly hard, say all the doctors interviewed for this story. Still, they remain optimistic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a politician,\u201d Arce says, but he adds: \u201cTo me, I wish the relationships between Cuba and the us were better. I mean, we are not going to do anything just being in the place where we\u2019ve been in the last 50 years.\u201d\n\nFor more information about Cambras\u2019s Ortodepdia 2016 conference, which runs from Sept. 26 to Oct. 1, email eventos@fpais.sld.cu; congreso@fpais.sld.cu; correointernacional@fpais.sld.cu; or commercial@fpais@sld.cu.
