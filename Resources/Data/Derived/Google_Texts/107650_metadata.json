The so-called Hobby Lobby decision, named for the chain of craft stores that brought the case, has been both praised and condemned for expanding religious rights and constraining Obamacare. But beneath the political implications, the ruling has significant economic undertones. It expands the right of corporations to be treated like people, part of a trend that may be contributing to the rise of economic inequality.\n\nThe notion that corporations are people is ridiculous on its face, but often true. Although Mitt Romney was mocked for saying it on the campaign trail a few summers ago, the U.S. Code, our national rule book, defines corporations as people in its very first sentence. And since the 19th century, the Supreme Court has ruled that corporations are entitled to a wide range of constitutional protections. This was a business decision, and it was a good one. Incorporation encourages risk-taking: Investors are far more likely to put money into a business that can outlast its creators; managers, for their part, are more likely to take risks themselves because they owe nothing to the investors if they fail.\n\nThe rise of corporations, which developed more fully in the United States than in other industrializing nations, helped to make it the richest nation on earth. And economic historians have found that states where businesses could incorporate more easily tended to grow more quickly, aiding New York\u2019s rise as a banking center and helping Pennsylvania\u2019s coal industry to outstrip Virginia\u2019s. The notion of corporate personhood still sounds weird, but we rely upon it constantly in our everyday lives. The corporation that published this column, for instance, is exercising its constitutional right to speak freely and to make contracts, taking money from some of you and giving a little to me.\n\nSince the 1950s, however, the treatment of corporations as people has expanded beyond its original economic logic. According to Naomi Lamoreaux, a professor of economics and history at Yale University, the success of incorporation led states to broaden eligibility to advocacy groups, like the N.A.A.C.P. and the Congress of Racial Equality, which then became \u201cthe first corporations to convince the Court that they deserved a broader set of rights.\u201d Ever since, the court has intermittently extended the logic of those rulings, and in 2010 it ruled that an advocacy group called Citizens United had the right to spend money on political advertising \u2014 and that every other corporation did, too. Last month, it added religious rights to the mix.\n\nThe basic justification is that corporations, owned by people, should have the same freedoms as people. And in many ways, of course, they already do. Chick-fil-A does not sell sandwiches on Sundays. Interstate Batteries tells prospective employees, \u201cWhile it is not necessary to be a Christian to be employed, it is a part of the daily work life for Interstate team members.\u201d In 1999, Omni Hotels said its new owner, a Christian, had made a \u201cmoral decision\u201d to stop selling pay-per-view pornography.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut corporations, as F. Scott Fitzgerald might have put it, are not like you and me. Those special legal powers, which allow them to play a valuable role in the economy, can also give them the financial power to tilt the rules of the game by lobbying for particular legislation, among other things. \u201cThose properties, so beneficial in the economic sphere, pose special dangers in the political sphere,\u201d Justice William Rehnquist wrote in a dissenting opinion from a 1978 ruling that is a precursor to Citizens United. \u201cIndeed, the States might reasonably fear that the corporation would use its economic power to obtain further benefits beyond those already bestowed.\u201d\n\nThe danger is not only that corporations can act at the expense of society, but also that the people who control them can act at the expense of their own shareholders, employees and customers. While the Hobby Lobby decision ostensibly addresses only a narrow set of circumstances \u2014 a corporation with relatively few owners, a religious objection to particular kinds of birth control \u2014 these sorts of limited rulings have a history of becoming more broadly cited as precedent over time. Also, the logic of this particular decision was so expansive and open-ended. \u201cA corporation is simply a form of organization used by human beings to achieve desired ends,\u201d Justice Samuel Alito wrote. \u201cWhen rights, whether constitutional or statutory, are extended to corporations, the purpose is to protect the rights of these people.\u201d Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg argued in her dissenting opinion that a corporation might object on religious grounds to paying for blood transfusions, vaccinations or antidepressants. Other scholars say the same logic could justify a right to privacy as a shield against regulatory scrutiny, or a right to bear arms.\n\nMinority shareholders have little power to influence the choices that corporations make. Benjamin I. Sachs, a law professor at Harvard University, notes that while federal law lets union members prevent the use of their dues for political purposes, shareholders do not have similar rights. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to say that collectives have speech rights, then we should treat unions and corporations the same,\u201d Sachs told me. Employees are even more vulnerable. When companies like YUM! Brands, which owns KFC and Taco Bell, campaign against minimum-wage increases, they are effectively using the profits generated by their employees to limit the compensation of those same employees. And of course, some of Hobby Lobby\u2019s 13,000 workers will now need to pay for contraception.\n\nShareholders can sell their shares, sure, and employees can find new jobs. But every increase in corporate rights is a potential limitation on the menu of available jobs and investments. \u201cThe idea that if you don\u2019t like what the corporation is doing you should sell your stock, or find a different job, has a certain amount of appeal,\u201d said Darrell A.H. Miller, a professor of law at Duke University. \u201cBut it also assumes that people are able to just fish and cut bait. Capital is easier to move around than your body and your family.\u201d\n\nIf the court follows the logic of its Hobby Lobby decision in the decades to come, it\u2019s not so hard to imagine a job market where people must interview employers about their religious and political views. Or where people who need to make a living may just feel compelled to accept a work environment increasingly shaped by their employers\u2019 beliefs.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "feature", "ptime": 20140722050014, "twitter": {"description": "Corporations, it turns out, really are people.
