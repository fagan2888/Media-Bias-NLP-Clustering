But much about the economic picture that will frame the 2016 presidential race will come into the focus in the next two weeks as the Federal Reserve prepares to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade and the job market improves to levels not seen since 2007. \u2026 The overall backdrop \u2013 an economy that is strong enough for the Fed to start hiking rates \u2013 should favor Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cBut the first Fed move, which is widely expected to come on December 16th, presents a potential wild card that could roil global markets, slow U.S. job growth and provide an opportunity for Republicans in an economy that retains significant structural problems that have left many voters deeply frustrated and casting about for tough-talking outsiders like Donald Trump.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOUT OF THE EMERGENCY ROOM; STILL IMPAIRED \u2013 \u201cBack in 2008, the U.S. economy was in the emergency room and we have slowly emerged. We can walk pretty fast now but we are still structurally impaired and cannot run,\u2019 said Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz. \u2018And the Federal Reserve action likely to come in December presents risks of both a policy mistake and a market accident.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe policy mistake would see the Fed tightening the U.S. money supply while Europe, Japan and China are all easing credit, creating a global \u201cdivergence\u201d which further drives up the U.S. dollar, hurting U.S. exporters and possibly creating big corporate defaults abroad for companies whose debt is held in dollars. The \u2018market accident\u2019 would see big stock price declines as investors decide profits can\u2019t hold up without the Fed pumping easy money into the system.\n\nNO STOPPING THE FED \u2013 \u201cBut none of these potential problems are likely to hold up the Fed, which is bordering on desperate to exit from its current emergency footing and to start the process before the 2016 election year begins. The dawn of the new economic age will begin this week as Fed Chair Janet Yellen speaks to the Economic Club of Washington on Wednesday and testifies before the Senate Joint Economic Committee on Thursday.\n\n\u201cYellen is widely expected to lay further ground work for a rate hike next week in both appearances. Analysts say she is likely to argue that with the unemployment rate at 5 percent, job growth strong and wages starting to rise, it no longer makes sense to have rates below zero, an emergency policy born of the financial crisis. \u2026 \u2018She has two opportunities now to set expectations for a rate hike in December,\u201d said Megan Greene, chief economist at Manulife.\n\n\u2018And Fed members have been tripping all over themselves to say they would like to normalize policy. They have been laying down sign posts everywhere.\u2019 Greene added that the Fed very much wants to get out of the way before the election. \u2018They don\u2019t like to talk about it, but I think they will be moving more for political reasons than economic ones.\u2019\u201d\n\nFED TIME TABLE \u2013 Via Morgan Stanley: \u201c[W]e've removed one hike from our expected path of tightening after December, and following a lengthy pause, we expect the Fed to next move in June 2016. \u2026 While a relatively low bar set by Fed officials for liftoff in December was met by the strong October employment report, the case for hiking rates now is not especially compelling from a dual mandate perspective\n\n\u201cIn particular, it\u2019s hard to see how any policymaker could claim to be \u2018reasonably confident\u2019 at this point that inflation is now on the way to 2 percent after core PCE has missed on the downside for eight straight years and has been nearly immobile at 1.3 percent all this year\u201d\n\nHAS THE CREDIT CYCLE ALREADY TURNED? \u2013 FT\u2019s Stephen Foley: \u201cDear future historians: Janet Yellen did not cause the late-2010s recession. If a Federal Reserve interest rate rise in December is followed in short order by an economic slowdown, the temptation will be to blame the central bank and its chair for a premature tightening of monetary policy. But there are a growing number of red flags that suggest the US credit cycle has already turned, with consequences for the real economy next year, even before the Fed makes its move. \u2026\n\n\u201cSmart money investors have positioned themselves for a rise in corporate defaults, a pullback in lending, and contagion across asset classes. The question is whether this is the start of a self-reinforcing downward spiral. The answer depends in part on the complex chain that links the deepest recesses of the credit markets to the real economy\u201d\n\nhttp://on.ft.com/1NjQzk9\n\nNEW ROLL BACK TUCKED INTO HIGHWAY BILL \u2013 Via a close watcher: \u201cThere is an amendment that was added to the Federal Highway Bill that will be voted on this week and the amendment attempts to repeal the Trust Indenture Act, a law that has been in place since 1939 and protects minority investors from majority investor groups ganging up on them and forcing them to take bad deal terms in the case of a bankruptcy or distressed situation\u201d\n\nREACT \u2013 Andrew Milgram, Managing Partner of Marblegate Asset Management: \u201cWe were very concerned to learn that Senators working on the federal transportation bill have added a completely unrelated financial amendment that would retroactively overturn 76 years of legal precedent established under the Trust Indenture Act (TIA), directly impact several high-profile court cases pending adjudication and remove vital protections for minority investors for which the law was created. This amendment directly undermines legal due process and Constitutional procedure.\u201d\n\nThe Amendment: http://politi.co/1NjLt7v\n\nNEWS FROM ACROSS THE POND: POLITICO PRO EUROPE BRIEF \u2014 POLITICO Pro, POLITICO\u2019s premium subscription service, has teamed up with POLITICO Europe to bring you POLITICO Pro Europe Brief.

One of these riders would block or delay the Department of Labor's (DOL) fiduciary rule. The other is Sen. Richard Shelby's (R-AL) banking bill, which includes a change to the automatic designation of banks with over $50 billion in assets as systemically important financial institutions.\n\n\u201cKBW analysts do not expect that the financial services-related policy riders will be included in the omnibus spending bill because they think Republicans have other policy riders that are higher priorities for them than the Shelby bill and the DOL policy rider, and analysts expect Republicans will push harder for these riders that are not related to the financial services sector. In KBW\u2019s view, Republicans would prefer to add policy riders on Syrian refugees and environment and energy-related riders like blocking the EPA's coal and Waters of the United States rules\u201d\n\nBUSINESS INVESTMENT STALLS OUT \u2013 WSJ\u2019s Eric Morath: \u201cBusiness investment across the U.S. is fizzling out. Companies appear reluctant to step up spending on the basic building blocks of the economy, such as machines, computers and new buildings. The broadest measure of U.S. business investment advanced 2.2 percent from a year earlier in the third quarter \u2026 marking one of the worse performances of the six-year-old economic expansion.\n\n\u201cOther measures show an even gloomier picture. A gauge of capital expenditures \u2014 orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft \u2014 declined 3.8 percent through the first 10 months of the year compared with the same period in 2014, according to government estimates. Weak investment restrains economic output, one key reason the economy has struggled to grow faster than 2 percent in recent years. The weakness also saps the economy\u2019s future potential\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1NmMJeD\n\nRENMINBI GOES GLOBAL \u2013 FT\u2019s Shawn Donnan in Washington and James Kynge in New York: \u201cThe IMF on Monday gave a major vote of confidence to China and its reform efforts, giving the renminbi greater weighting than the yen or pound as it included the currency in its elite basket of reserve currencies. \u2026 The vote by the board to make the renminbi the fifth currency in the basket used to value the IMF\u2019s own de facto currency followed months of deliberation at the fund and years of lobbying by a Beijing eager for the recognition. \u2026\n\n\u201cThe Rmb\u2019s elevation to the club of elite global reserve currencies is a big step for China and a significant one for the international monetary system,\u2019 said Eswar Prasad, professor of economics at Cornell University and a former IMF China mission chief. The renminbi will become the third biggest currency in the \u2018special drawing rights\u2019 basket when it takes effect on October 1. The move is largely symbolic but Christine Lagarde, IMF managing director, called it a \u2018milestone\u2019 in China\u2019s economic reform \u2018journey\u2019 and its integration into the global financial system\u201d http://on.ft.com/1Qab2gD\n\nCUOMO EYES NEW LIMITS ON BANKS \u2013 IMF\u2019s Ben Protess: \u201cAs authorities around the globe grapple with the threat of terrorism, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is preparing to impose new regulations on New York State banks to prevent illicit money from flowing through Wall Street and into the hands of militants and criminals. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, plans to propose rules this week that would clarify and expand the responsibility of New York State banks to thwart money laundering and the financing of terrorist groups \u2026\n\n\u201cThe rules \u2014 a jolt to New York banks as well as to the federal regulators who typically police such transactions \u2014 would force a chief compliance officer to certify that a bank maintains systems to \u2018detect, weed out and prevent illicit\u2019 money transfers. If compliance officers file an \u2018incorrect or false\u2019 certification, they could face criminal charges under the rules, a rare effort to hold financial executives criminally liable. At its core, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s proposal aims to block terrorists from using the New York financial system, the center of dollar-based finance and global capitalism. The effort, though, could prove challenging, as New York banks process billions of dollars in payments on behalf of clients who often hide behind layers of legitimate front groups.\u201d http://nyti.ms/1Qaaw24\n\nWARREN A NO-SHOW FOR CLINTON \u2013 WP\u2019s Anne Gearan and Mike DeBonis: \u201cThe tableau surrounding Hillary Clinton on Monday was impressive: 13 female Democratic senators endorsing the Democratic 2016 presidential front-runner en masse. The evening fundraising event on Capitol Hill brought in a chunk of campaign cash ahead of an often difficult fundraising month in December. But it was also meant to underscore Clinton\u2019s near-monopoly among Democratic lawmakers who have declared a preference, and her appeal as the first woman with a strong shot at becoming president.\n\n\u201cBut one particularly influential female Democratic senator didn\u2019t join her colleagues: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) \u2014 the anti-Wall Street crusader who was courted to run as the darling of very liberal Democrats \u2014 has not endorsed Clinton, nor has she promised she will. Her absence served as an awkward reminder of Clinton\u2019s enduring struggle to generate support and enthusiasm among an influential segment of her party\u2019s most liberal members\u201d http://wapo.st/1YEOAip\n\nMORGAN STANLEY CUTS JOBS \u2013 WSJ\u2019s Justin Baer: \u201cMorgan Stanley plans to slash hundreds of jobs from its debt and currencies division, people familiar with the matter said, revealing that the Wall Street firm believes that a months-long slump in trading revenue may persist. Morgan Stanley company could eliminate as much as a quarter of the business\u2019s workforce \u2026 The cuts will occur across all of the division\u2019s offices, and on each of the firm\u2019s trading desks, though London is expected to bear a slightly bigger brunt than New York, the people said.\n\n\u201cThe potential cuts reflect Morgan Stanley\u2019s acceptance that a slowdown in client activity that took root during the summer months may not reverse any time soon. The New York firm also faces pressure from investors to lift its returns on equity that have often languished below a 10% target set by James Gorman, Morgan Stanley\u2019s chairman and chief executive. New capital rules have penalized big banks for holding vast inventories of bonds and other debt securities, forcing them into difficult decisions on how big their trading businesses can remain in the postcrisis era\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1Pq5y2G\n\nFED TO RESTRICT LOANS \u2013 NYT\u2019s Peter Eavis: \u201cIn the lead-up to the financial crisis of 2008, the Federal Reserve had the ability to make huge emergency loans to almost any entity it chose, a power it used to help save Wall Street firms from possible collapse. Now, seven years later, the Fed, under the direction of Congress, has adopted a new rule that would place restrictions on its extraordinary financial powers. The restrictions, which stem from the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, aim to ensure that the Fed\u2019s emergency loans are not used to shore up insolvent firms.\n\n\u201cThe five members of the Fed\u2019s board on Monday voted to approve the rule, which takes effect on Jan. 1. The Fed\u2019s emergency loans point to a quandary at the heart of the financial system. Many specialists say central banks, so-called lenders of last resort, need to have a free hand to lend liberally in a crisis to keep panics from taking down healthy firms. But others say the availability of emergency loans encourages banks to pursue habits \u2014 like making excessive use of short-term borrowing to finance their activities \u2014 that make the system unstable in the first place.\u201d\n\n** A message from the American Bankers Association: What would regulatory relief mean for your hometown?

Home, auto, and business insurers are committed to assisting policyholders in need, quickly and efficiently. Insurers have a strong track record following even the most devastating of natural disasters. In the wake of Superstorm Sandy, insurers settled more than 130,000 flood claims, with only one percent of claims going to litigation. The private insurance sector paid more than 1,500,000 million Sandy claims from all other insured losses, with less than one percent going to litigation. But there is still work to be done. Insurers are looking at new tools and methods to improve our response after natural disasters. The industry also is working with Congress to make improvements to the flood insurance system.
