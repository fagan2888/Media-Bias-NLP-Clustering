The White House on Monday warned Republican presidential hopefuls that promising to repeal President Obama’s signature healthcare reform law is a proven political loser.

“There was a presidential candidate who ran in 2012 promising to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and that campaign pledge didn’t work out very well for him,” press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters.

The comments came on the same day Sen. Ted Cruz Ted CruzEleven states sue Obama over transgender bathroom directive Poll: Clinton leads Trump in Wisconsin by double digits GOP senators propose sending ISIS fighters to Gitmo MORE (R-Texas) launched his presidential campaign pledging to roll back Obama’s agenda, including repealing “every word” of ObamaCare.

Earnest was reluctant to speak in depth about the 2016 campaign, but he did allude to 2012 GOP candidate Mitt Romney, who also promised to repeal the healthcare law.

Earnest, however, said he does not have a “direct response” to anything proposed by Cruz or any of the other potential presidential hopefuls seeking to replace Obama. He also declined to weigh in on Cruz’s desire to abolish the IRS.

"There will be a robust debate about the future of the country,” Earnest said. “The president is certainly pleased about the substantial progress that has been made over the last six years. There is a lot more the president hopes to get done in his remaining two years in office.”
