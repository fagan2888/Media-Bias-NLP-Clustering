I hope that somewhere on Rector Street there can be some recognition of its connection to Rutgers-Newark.\n\nTed Einhorn, Rockaway\n\nGay marriage isn\u2019t the court\u2019s issue\n\nThe gay marriage decision by Superior Court Judge Mary Jacobson (\u201cJudge: N.J. must let gay couples marry,\u201d Sept. 28) violated many of the prongs of the \u201cpolitical question doctrine\u201d set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in Baker vs. Carr.\n\nSame-sex marriage, without question, is a political question and therefore beyond the jurisdiction of the courts. There is a bill returning to the Legislature from Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s veto on this very matter. The issue remains in the political arena.\n\nCourts do not have the authority to create rights. This was made clear at our country\u2019s founding when Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist No. 78, observed: \u201cThe legislature not only commands the purse but prescribes the rules in which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated.\u201d\n\nSo our Legislature should consider impeachment proceedings against Jacobson because she violated the U.S. and New Jersey constitutions, and therefore her oath of office, in her ruling. It\u2019s time our elected officials speak out on the court\u2019s trespassing into the political domain, not only on gay marriage, but also on issues such as school funding and affordable housing \u2014 all political questions.\n\nDouglas Wicks, Basking Ridge\n\nBirchers are back\n\nInstead of sanctimoniously wrapping themselves in the Constitution at every turn, today\u2019s congressional Republicans should consider reading it. The presidential candidate who opposed the Affordable Care Act lost. \u201cObamacare\u201d was passed by the legislative branch and upheld by the judicial branch. The minority\u2019s opposition was constitutionally defeated.\n\nHaving exhausted their constitutional options, Republicans are down to holding the economy hostage to achieve their goal of overturning the ACA, which by the way is established U.S. law.\n\nBut why stop there? As long as bypassing the Constitution is on the table, why not eliminate other established laws that their predecessors, the John Birch Society, couldn\u2019t overturn: Social Security, unemployment, welfare, NASA, federal funding for highways and bridges, civil rights and all those pesky regulations.\n\nFortunately, our grandparents ignored the small-government types. With the help of government investment, we went to the moon, made investments in technologies that would later lead the world and created a prosperous society where all, and not just the few, prosper.\n\nBob Verbeek, Leonia\n\nWhat will cut costs?\n\nNo matter how much lipstick The Star-Ledger attempts to put on the Affordable Care Act, common sense and history have shown us that another bloated government program will do little to solve health care problems.\n\nI keep looking for what is in the law that will actually reduce health care costs, and I come up empty. The only thing I see is more government programs that will add to the tax burden and place the future of health care in jeopardy.\n\nReducing premiums to doctors, who already are leaving the profession, is hardly a solution to decrease health care costs. If the government truly wanted to reduce costs, it should ask health care professionals, who will tell them to look at items such as tort and liability reform.\n\n\u201cObamacare\u201d is a political ploy for the government to obtain more control of our lives.\n\nGregory Borsinger, Chatham\n\nBlame for a shutdown\n\nThe government has shut down at great risk to our country. Do you think our Republican senators and House representatives care when Democrats call? Of course not. They only care about your vote.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act passed both houses of Congress, the president signed it and the Supreme Court affirmed it. That is all three branches of the government. The people re-elected President Obama, who campaigned for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDo you really want the government to shut down to prevent the evils of:\n\n\u2022 Adult children in their 20s staying on their parents\u2019 medical plan;\n\n\u2022 Making insurance available to people with pre-existing conditions;\n\n\u2022 Rewarding hospitals for lowering costs while improving health care;\n\n\u2022 Permitting people to buy insurance coverage in a competitive environment;\n\n\u2022 Bringing efficiency and accountability to a notoriously unaccountable system; and\n\n\u2022 Saving the country money?\n\nPolls say people will blame Republican legislators for the shutdown. Perhaps they should blame Republican voters who didn\u2019t make their voices heard.\n\nJane Reynolds, Madison", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "news", "title": "Letters: Shaquille O'Neal, gay marriage, Obamacare, federal shutdown", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Letters: Shaquille O\\u0027Neal, gay marriage, Obamacare, federal shutdown\", \"link\": \"http://blog.nj.com/ledgerletters/2013/10/letters_shaquille_oneal_gay_ma.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/star-ledger/photo/2013/09/-510f3e34cf246e9a.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11348599\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-02T10:30:44Z\", \"author\": \"Letters to the Editor | The Star-Ledger\", \"tags\": [] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/star-ledger/photo/2013/09/-510f3e34cf246e9a.jpg", "description": "Former NBA star Shaquille O'Neal puts his arm around Mayor Cory Booker during the groundbreaking ceremony for One Riverview on Rector Street in Newark.
