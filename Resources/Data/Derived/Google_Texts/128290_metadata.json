Now the paralyzing virus is endemic to only three countries \u2014 Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria. And there were just 223 cases globally last year.\n\nThere have been setbacks recently, including reports of suspected cases inside Syria and an outbreak in Somalia.\n\nThis timeline explores how polio went from one of the most feared illnesses in the world to a disease on the ropes.\n\nDuring the past few decades, governments, foundations and nonprofits have joined forces to train thousands of health workers, immunize millions of kids and develop stronger vaccination systems that are also reaching children with other health services.\n\nUntil the transmission of poliovirus is stopped in endemic countries, the threat of outbreaks in other areas of the world remains. Nevertheless, health leaders are aiming to eradicate polio completely by 2018.\n\nAuthor and historian David Oshinsky is the Director of Medical Humanities at the New York University School of Medicine. He won the 2006 Pulitzer Prize for his book Polio: An American Story.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "description": "Just a few decades ago, polio was crippling more than a thousand children each day.
