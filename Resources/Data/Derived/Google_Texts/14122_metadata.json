The firm has since been fighting allegations that it turned a blind eye to massive cyber fraud.\n\n\n\nThousands of Americans have filed their \u201cpaperwork\u201d online this year only to find someone else already filed for them. Resolving the issue can take up to 10 months, Levin said.\n\n\n\nCapitol Hill has taken notice, launching investigations on both the Senate and House side as lawmakers prepare for hearings in March.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are assiduously working on it,\u201d Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch Orrin HatchOvernight Defense: VA chief 'deeply' regrets Disney remark; Senate fight brews over Gitmo Senate GOP gears up for fight over Gitmo transfers House Republicans press case for impeaching IRS commissioner MORE (R-Utah) told The Hill. \u201cWe\u2019re always naturally concerned about people who defraud the government and there\u2019s too much of that going on.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut it\u2019s a problem with no easy solution, experts say.\n\n\n\nElectronic filing is becoming ubiquitous \u2014 86 percent of taxpayers filed online last year. It\u2019s created a quick and simple way to file fake tax returns, churning out huge revenues with little danger or risk of imprisonment, experts say.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to stop,\u201d said Verenda Smith, deputy director of the Federation of Tax Administrators (FTA). \u201cThey don\u2019t ever get caught. They\u2019re not going to jail. All they\u2019re doing is making money.\u201d\n\n\n\nStreet gang violence is even down in cities like Tampa, Florida, as criminals shift to digital tax fraud, said Steven Weisman, a professor at Bentley University, lawyer and author of several books on identity theft.\n\n\n\nCorey Williams, one former member of a cyber crime ring that racked up millions in e-tax fraud, recently explained how simple the process was to CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnybody who knew about it, you\u2019d be a fool to not try to get involved with making some money,\u201d said Williams, now one of the few tax fraudsters serving time in prison. \u201cI could wake up in the comfort of my own home, and just get on a laptop, do about 15 returns a day. Fifteen times $3,000 a return, that\u2019s $45,000 a day.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd the personal information exposed when major companies are hacked has only made the process easier, security experts explain. In the past year, hundreds of millions of Americans\u2019 sensitive data have been compromised through hacks at retailers like Home Depot, banks like JPMorgan Chase and federal agencies like the U.S. Postal Service.\n\n\n\nThe recent data breach at health insurer Anthem, which exposed nearly 80 millions consumers\u2019 information, is \u201ccase in point,\u201d Levin said. The cache of PII that hit the black market after the hack was a goldmine for tax fraudsters.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s everything \u2014 name, phone number, medical ID, Social Security number, email address,\u201d he said. \u201cYou name it, they got it.\u201d\n\n\n\nArmed with all that, \u201csuccess is pretty much almost guaranteed,\u201d Levin said.\n\n\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which oversees federal tax filings, got relatively high marks from experts for being attuned to the threat of e-fraud.\n\n\n\nAlthough the agency reported it paid $5.2 billion in fraudulent tax refunds during last year\u2019s filing season, it also said it thwarted another $24.2 billion in attempted fraud, a noted improvement from previous years.\n\n\n\nThe agency has more than doubled the number of employees working on identity theft since 2011 and also said it bolstered security measures this year to better suss out fraudulent electronic filings.\n\n\n\nDarkTrace\u2019s Penrose called the steps \u201cpretty substantial.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"We closely monitor incoming tax returns, watching for fraud indicators and adjusting our systems as necessary,\" the IRS said in a recent statement.\n\n\n\nBut lawmakers believe the agency might be able to do better.\n\n\n\nHatch pointed to the recent HealthCare.gov glitch that caused roughly 800,000 taxpayers to receive incorrect tax forms for their government health insurance subsidy. Fifty thousand people filed returns based on the inaccurate data before the problem was caught.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow that\u2019s minuscule compared to the total number of taxpayers, but it\u2019s still, it indicates that they may not be on top of things like they should be,\u201d Hatch told The Hill.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been chatting with the IRS head on a regular basis to see what we can do to solve problems like that,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re working behind the scenes on everything involving taxes and we\u2019re going to continue to do so.\u201d\n\n\n\nHatch\u2019s committee is investigating e-tax fraud more generally and plans to hold hearings soon on the issue, but the chairman did not give a specific timeline.\n\n\n\nSeveral tax experts agreed the department is trying to curb fraud \u201cwith one hand tied behind their back,\u201d as the FTA\u2019s Smith put it.\n\n\n\nFrom general budget constraints to the amazing ease of committing e-tax fraud, \u201cthey're fighting a difficult battle,\u201d Weisman said.\n\n\n\nRegardless of the steps the IRS takes, many believe e-tax fraud will continue unabated until the private sector ups its cyber defenses and slows the growth of mega breaches.\n\n\n\nCongress is considering several bills that industry groups argue would help the private sector better thwart cyberattacks. The measures would increase the data flow between the public and private sectors to give companies a better picture of their cyber threats.\n\n\n\nBut lawmakers have struggled to come to consensus on the details of such a bill and many wonder how effective it would actually be.\n\n\n\nIt all adds up to more years of growing e-tax fraud, experts agreed.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, Weisman recommended two steps for consumers to help lower their risk of tax fraud. One, be judicious in giving out your Social Security number. Two, file your taxes early to reduce the chances a fraudster beats you to it.\n\n\n\nWeisman acknowledged the protections are minimal.\n\n\u201cI do think it will get worse before it gets better,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Nineteen states have recently noticed spikes in electronic filing fraud.", "description": "Nineteen states have recently noticed spikes in electronic filing fraud.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Nineteen states have recently noticed spikes in electronic filing fraud.", "title": "Data breaches fuel new era of tax fraud", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/234190-data-breaches-fuel-new-era-of-tax-fraud", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/taxfraud_022715getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T03:29-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/234190-data-breaches-fuel-new-era-of-tax-fraud", "dcterms.date": "2015-03-01T08:00-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Ben Goad", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Orrin Hatch,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-01T08:00:04-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/234190-data-breaches-fuel-new-era-of-tax-fraud", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Nineteen states have recently noticed spikes in electronic filing fraud.", "card": "summary", "title": "Data breaches fuel new era of tax fraud"}, "dcterms.title": "Data breaches fuel new era of tax fraud"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda559\"", "article_summary": "The rash of massive data breaches across the United States is driving a new era of electronic tax fraud that has caught Congress\u2019s attention and left consumers wondering if their tax information is safe.\nIn the meantime, Weisman recommended two steps for consumers to help lower their risk of tax fraud.\nThe firm has since been fighting allegations that it turned a blind eye to massive cyber fraud.\nFrom general budget constraints to the amazing ease of committing e-tax fraud, \u201cthey're fighting a difficult battle,\u201d Weisman said.\nIt all adds up to more years of growing e-tax fraud, experts agreed."}
