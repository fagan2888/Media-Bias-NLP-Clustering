Humana covers about 42,000 people and Magnolia about 20,000. The federal government, under the Affordable Care Act, subsidizes a substantial portion of the premiums paid by those insured through the exchange.\n\nFor people insured on the exchange by Magnolia, premiums are expected to go down by 25 percent. Humana\u2019s Mississippi exchange customers can expect to pay 6.5 percent more on premiums.\n\nMississippians on group plans outside of the exchange can count on higher premiums as well. For instance, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mississippi is proposing a 9.7 percent increase in premiums, according to Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney. The commissioner reviews the group rates but has no authority to approve or reject them.\n\nHumana has applied to continue coverage in 40 of the state\u2019s 82 counties. Magnolia Health, which administers a 77,000-member Medicaid network around the state, serves the remaining counties. CEO Jason Dees said Thursday Magnolia has applied to add two more counties but declined to identify them.\n\nCommissioner Chaney said several factors led Magnolia to ask for a decrease in rates. The chief cause, he said, was Magnolia\u2019s \u201cMedical Loss Ratio,\u201d which requires that 80 percent to 85 percent of each premium dollar be spent on medical care. \u201cTheir (insured) population was relatively healthy,\u201d which limited the portion of premiums spent on care, Chaney said. \u201cThey needed to lower their rates.\u201d\n\nMagnolia was not in the penalty range the ACA sets for Medical Loss Ratio, Chaney said. In fact, the insurer was \u201cclose\u201d to meeting the federal ratio.\n\nAnother reason for the rate drop: Magnolia needs to approximately double its number of insured through the exchange. Otherwise, according to Chaney, it will continue to have difficulty giving its customers an adequate care network.\n\nAnother cause of Magnolia\u2019s lagging number of insured compared to Humana is the state\u2019s refusal to expand Medicaid to people with incomes from 100 percent to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. About 100,000 Mississippians fall into that category by either making an income too high for current Medicaid edibility but too low to qualify for the health care exchange.\n\nMagnolia is also counting on a rate decrease to help attract Mississippians who are slightly better off financially than others on the exchange. This means targeting people have incomes within 200 percent to 400 percent of the federal poverty rate, according to Chaney. \u201cThe tax subsidies (from the ACA) decrease dramatically when you get above 200 percent\u201d of poverty level, he added.\n\nHumana\u2019s \u201ccheaper rates\u201d put Magnolia at a disadvantage in attracting this category of insured, Chaney noted.\n\nHumana spokesman Mitch Lubitz said the insurer exceeded its enrollment projections in Mississippi. Most of the 40,000 it signed up did not have coverage before implantation of the ACA, he said.\n\nNew enrollment for the Mississippi exchange begins Nov. 15.\n\nHumana expects to charge its new and current customers premiums 6.5 percent higher than 2014 rates \u201cprimarily because of the health conditions of those who enrolled in Mississippi,\u201d Lubitz said.\n\nHe also cited an increased use of health care and medical services by its exchange members, along with higher medical claims.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Mississippi Business Journal", "description": "Mississippians on the state\u2019s federally run health insurance exchange will see both increases and de...", "title": "Higher rates for Humana, lower for Magnolia ahead on health exchange", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://msbusiness.com/files/2013/09/healthcare-reform_rgb-300x300.jpg", "url": "http://msbusiness.com/2014/08/higher-rates-humana-lower-magnolias-ahead-health-exchange/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/mbjournal", "section": "Health", "tag": "Obamacare", "published_time": "2014-08-22T15:09:13-05:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mississippians on the state\u2019s federally run health insurance exchange will see both increases and decreases in premiums starting Jan. 1.
