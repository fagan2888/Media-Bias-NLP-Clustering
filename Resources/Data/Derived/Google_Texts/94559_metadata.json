Jim Butler told Ohio Watchdog.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so important for the patient to be able to make that decision for themselves, because the alternative is the government making the decision,\u201d he added.\n\nButler, an Oakwood Republican, sees price transparency as a critical ingredient to fighting \u201cthe unrelenting inflation of medical costs\u201d without government rationing.\n\nInsurance policies requiring co-pays for routine medical procedures give Ohioans an incentive to take more control of their care; price transparency could provide the information to make that possible.\n\nRequiring price transparency will make Ohio\u2019s private insurance market function closer to the way an insurance market should, Butler said.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a catastrophic event you\u2019re covered, but for day-to-day stuff we really need to have skin in the game,\u201d he asserted.\n\nButler hopes price transparency will have a big impact on Medicaid spending, too, when coupled with his Healthy Ohio Program to incorporate private health savings account features into Medicaid.\n\nBased on the Healthy Indiana Plan, HOP will put Medicaid funding into individual HSAs enrollees can use to pay for medical costs. Each enrollee will be required to contribute the lesser of $99 a year or 2 percent of their income to their HSA.\n\n\u201cWith Healthy Ohio, we\u2019re able to have Medicaid patients \u2014 just like commercial insurance patients now \u2014 have an element of cost-sharing so they care what they\u2019re spending, as well,\u201d Butler said.\n\nHOP and health care price transparency were introduced in April as part of a package of health care reforms bundled in House Bill 157, but both proposals were enacted in separate bills at the end of June.\n\nRELATED: Ohio House bill could save billions in medical costs each year\n\nButler told Ohio Watchdog he was pleased to see two of HB 157\u2019s major provisions adopted through the state\u2019s 2016-17 budget negotiations.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re the most significant things that are in the budget,\u201d he said.\n\nHOP passed in House Bill 64, the general operating budget. Butler\u2019s price transparency proposal passed as part of House Bill 52, the Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation budget.\n\nButler and several other House conservatives voted for HB 64 \u2014 which included billions in Obamacare Medicaid expansion spending \u2014 to ensure health care price transparency and HOP became law.\n\nStarting Jan. 1, 2017, Ohio health care providers will be required to give each patient an estimate of the amount their insurance company will be billed, the amount their insurance company will pay and their out-of-pocket cost for each service.\n\nBetween now and then, the Ohio Department of Medicaid will develop detailed rules and guidelines in an effort to ensure the law works effectively without adding unreasonable overhead for insurers and providers.\n\nHOP, meanwhile, will require approval of a Medicaid waiver from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Republican Gov. John Kasich\u2019s administration has already expressed skepticism that a waiver request will be granted.\n\nButler anticipates support from House leadership for medical malpractice reform and the other remaining measures in HB 157, which is sponsored by Republican State Rep. Terry Johnson and 22 Republican cosponsors.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jaw-dropping bills for routine medical care will be a thing of the past for Ohioans if a new state law works as intended.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Jaw-dropping bills for routine medical care will be a thing of the past for Ohioans if a new state law works as intended.", "title": "Ohio looks to be a pioneer in health care price transparency - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/07/jim-butler-ohio-house-floor.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-01T15:27:03+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/226966/ohio-price-transparency/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Jaw-dropping bills for routine medical care will be a thing of the past for Ohioans if a new state law works as intended.", "title": "Ohio looks to be a pioneer in health care price transparency - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/07/jim-butler-ohio-house-floor.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Health Care", "published_time": "2015-07-02T04:00:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-01T15:27:03+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "jim butler, price transparency, health price transparency, healthy ohio program, ohio medicaid, ohio health reform, ohio health care reform, ohio health care price transparency, ohio house bill 157"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfca8\"", "article_summary": "HOP and health care price transparency were introduced in April as part of a package of health care reforms bundled in House Bill 157, but both proposals were enacted in separate bills at the end of June.\nRequiring price transparency will make Ohio\u2019s private insurance market function closer to the way an insurance market should, Butler said.\nButler and several other House conservatives voted for HB 64 \u2014 which included billions in Obamacare Medicaid expansion spending \u2014 to ensure health care price transparency and HOP became law.\nButler\u2019s price transparency proposal passed as part of House Bill 52, the Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation budget.\nButler, an Oakwood Republican, sees price transparency as a critical ingredient to fighting \u201cthe unrelenting inflation of medical costs\u201d without government rationing."}
