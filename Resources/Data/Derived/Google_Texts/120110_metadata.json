These lawyers face fierce competition in persuading clients to hire them, participating in a not-so-glamorous competition known in the industry as a \u201cbeauty contest.\u201d At these lawyerly pageants, attorneys competing to take the case make their pitch and try to persuade the client that their firm is the best suitor.\n\nIn my new book, Unprecedented: The Constitutional Challenge to Obamacare (affiliate link), I go backstage and look at two of the most high-profile beauty contests in Supreme Court history: who would represent (1) the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) and (2) twenty-six states in their respective challenges to the constitutionality of Obamacare.\n\nHow did these litigants go about choosing their counsel? Which lawyers and law firms got passed over?\n\nNFIB hosted their beauty contest first, after it became clear that they would likely win in federal court in Florida. They sought to hire a firm that would represent their interests, separate from the twenty-six states, in the Court of Appeals and eventually in the Supreme Court. Several leading appellate firms in Washington, D.C., were in contention, including Gibson, Dunn, & Crutcher; King & Spalding; Jones Day; and others. Initially, I was told by lawyers involved in making the selection, the case was \u201cpresumptively\u201d going to Gibson, but after Jones Day\u2019s pitch, which approached the case from the \u201cground floor,\u201d NFIB changed its mind.\n\nKaren Harned, executive director of NFIB\u2019s legal center, told me she \u201cdidn\u2019t really know the attorneys at Jones Day\u201d before the interview, but was \u201cblown away at the level of thought they had already given the case \u2014 a lot more than from other firms.\u201d Harned was also impressed by the breadth of experience at Jones Day, which had recently hired a large number of Supreme Court clerks from both conservative and liberal justices.\n\nNFIB did consider Paul Clement, who at the time was working at King & Spalding but would soon depart for Bancroft. Clement was \u201cfantastic,\u201d but \u201cJones Day had more resources,\u201d Harned recalled. Ultimately, NFIB hired Jones Day, led by partners Michael Carvin, Gregory Katsas, and C. Kevin Marshall, and associates Hashim Mooppan and Yaakov Roth.\n\nThe second beauty contest would be held by Florida\u2019s newly-elected Attorney General Pam Bondi, who had taken the lead for the twenty-six states challenging Obamacare. For Bondi, NFIB\u2019s hiring of Jones Day \u201caccelerated the decision to\u201d hire new counsel.\n\nAt its beauty contest, Florida interviewed over a dozen potential Supreme Court advocates. Florida did not consider Ted Olson of Gibson, Dunn, & Crutcher, who was President Bush\u2019s solicitor general and had argued Bush v. Gore and dozens of other cases before the Court. Despite his prolific record for conservative legal causes, Olson\u2019s work in challenging the constitutionality of Proposition 8 and supporting same-sex marriage was a red flag and cause for concern among the Republican attorneys general. Otherwise, I was told, Olson \u201cwould have certainly been in the running.\u201d Florida also considered Maureen Mahoney and Gregory Garre of Latham & Watkins, as well as Bartow Farr (who would ultimately be appointed by the Supreme Court to argue an issue the government abandoned).\n\nEventually, the contest came down to three finalists: Paul Clement of Bancroft PLLC; Miguel Estrada of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher; and Chuck Cooper of Cooper & Kirk. Thankfully there was no swimsuit competition, so they went straight to the talent portion. Bondi flew to Washington to personally interview Clement. She \u201creally liked [Clement\u2019s] demeanor\u201d and thought he \u201chad it all.\u201d With fifty arguments before the Court and an \u201cincredibly eloquent\u201d style, he was the \u201cpackage deal.\u201d There was \u201cno question\u201d that Clement, and his superlative associate Erin Murphy at Bancroft, would be the team. And he came with an attractive price tag: a flat fee of $250,000, to be shared by the twenty-six states.\n\n* * * * *\n\nOn Monday, September 16, 2013 at 6:00 p.m., the Georgetown Supreme Court Institute will be holding a panel discussion on how these high-powered Supreme Court litigators developed and presented their arguments to the Nine.
