I\u2019m talking, of course, about the man California just re-elected, Jerry Brown. The man who took California from broke and ungovernerable as it was said to be under Governor English-as-a-Second Language-took it to flush and leading the nation in job creation. If jerry brown was 55, that accomplishment in this giant state would have Democrats hyping him for president. But they\u2019re not, because he\u2019s 76 and ageism is the last acceptable prejudice in America. Well, that and Asian drivers.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nMaher added, \u201cJerry Brown may be 76 but he runs three miles every day and he does yoga, whereas the only exercise [Gov.] Chris Christie (R-NJ) gets is pumping the nacho cheese dispenser. Four years ago, CNN replaced Larry King with the man who disproved the adage that all English people are smart [Piers Morgan]. And Larry wasn\u2019t let go because he got worse at what he did. He does a web show now, and he\u2019s exactly the same. i.e., better than the rest of the news folk on TV, and he\u2019s not better in spite of being 80. He\u2019s better because he\u2019s 80.\u201d\n\nHe concluded, \u201c78 should not be too old to be president. Wisdom isn\u2019t something you can just Google, and governing is where we need wisdom. A concept that wise, ancient cultures already know, Chinese people would no more disrespect their elders than they would use the left-turn signal.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Maher: Jerry Brown for President", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Maher: Jerry Brown for President", "title": "Maher: Jerry Brown for President - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-TV/2014/11/08/Maher%20Jerry%20Brown%20Thumbnail.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2014/11/08/maher-jerry-brown-for-president/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Maher: Jerry Brown for President", "title": "Maher: Jerry Brown for President - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-TV/2014/11/08/Maher%20Jerry%20Brown%20Thumbnail.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Jerry Brown, Piers Morgan, Twitter,Breitbart TV,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "Twitter", "published_time": "2014-11-08T06:55:00-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde92c\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERHBO\u2019s \u201cReal Time\u201d host Bill Maher stumped for California Governor Jerry Brown (D) and urged Democrats to nominate him for president on Friday.\nIf jerry brown was 55, that accomplishment in this giant state would have Democrats hyping him for president.\nI\u2019m talking, of course, about the man California just re-elected, Jerry Brown.\nWell, that and Asian drivers.\u201dSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERMaher added, \u201cJerry Brown may be 76 but he runs three miles every day and he does yoga, whereas the only exercise [Gov.]\nHe\u2019s better because he\u2019s 80.\u201dHe concluded, \u201c78 should not be too old to be president."}
