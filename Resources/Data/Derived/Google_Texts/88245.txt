Aledade says its Delaware-based accountable care organization nearly doubled in size to 24 doctors in the first four months of 2015.

After beginning with 13 physician practices and 10,500 attributed Medicare patients on Jan. 1, the Aledade Delaware Accountable Care Organization (ACO) has recruited 11 more practices and now covers more than 18,000 attributed Medicare patients, the group announced last week.

Founded by Maryland-based Aledade, the ACO's day-to-day operations are managed by Quality Insights of Delaware.

"Our success so far – and the interest in our model since we launched on Jan. 1 – speaks to a recognition that value-based health care is here to stay and Delaware physicians are willing and eager to embrace changes taking place across the health care industry," said Aledade CEO and co-founder Dr. Farzad Mostashari in a statement.

ACOs are groups of doctors, hospitals and other health care providers who unite voluntarily to give coordinated care to Medicare patients. ACOs are characterized by a payment and care delivery model that ties provider reimbursements to quality metrics and reductions in the total cost of care. The Affordable Care Act includes a provision that allows Medicare to reward ACOs with bonuses for delivering care more efficiently.

Founded in 2014, Aledade has created ACOs in New York, Maryland and Arkansas, as well as Delaware. The company recently announce partnerships to form additional organizations in West Virginia, Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana, Kansas and Florida.
