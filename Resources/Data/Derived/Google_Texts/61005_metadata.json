Richard Burr, R-N.C., Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and House Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton, R-Mich.\n\nThe proposal calls for a repeal of President Obama\u2019s signature law; however, it retains so many of the same provisions found within the Affordable Care Act that the Washington Post has dubbed it \u201cObamacare Lite.\u201d\n\nRepublicans attempt to defend this fact by stating that the goal is to avoid regression. Senator Hatch wrote in a statement,\n\nWe agree we can\u2019t return to the status quo of the pre-ObamaCare world, so we equip patients with tools that will drive down costs while also ensuring those with pre-existing conditions and the young are protected.\n\nThe Republican alternative reduces federal regulation of insurance policies, entrusting the states with the authority to specify the \u201cessential health benefits\u201d that are required to be provided by insurance. Unlike ObamaCare, the Republican plan does not include a federal exchange, but permits the states to run such marketplaces at their discretion.\n\n\"We can lower costs and expand access to quality coverage and care by empowering individuals and their families to make their own healthcare decisions, rather than having the federal government make those decisions for them,\" Senator Burr said.\n\nThe proposal outlines provisions for targeted tax credits to individuals and families up to three times the poverty level in an effort to encourage people to purchase plans in the marketplace. Large subsidies would still be offered to low income individuals and families, but would be less than the current ones, which have been estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to cost a total of $1 trillion over the next decade.\n\nLike ObamaCare, the Republican alternative would permit young people to stay on their parents\u2019 health plan until the age of 26, but it would also allow states to opt out of that provision. The \"blueprint\" also states that \u201cno one can be denied coverage based on a pre-existing condition,\u201d though that provision would apply only to those who have been continuously covered by insurance. For the previouslyy uninsured, the new proposal allows for a \u201cone-time open enrollment period in which individuals would be able to purchase coverage regardless of their health status or pre-existing conditions.\u201d\n\nUnder ObamaCare, premiums for older Americans cannot be more than three times what younger people are charged. The Republican proposal changes that ratio to five to one, and allows states the authority to set increased or decreased restrictions.\n\nUnder the Republican plan, employers are still incentivized to provide coverage to their employees through tax deductions.\n\nRepublicans included provisions they\u2019ve long been advocating, which would permit insurers to sell plans across state lines and limit the amount of monetary damages awarded in medical malpractice suits.\n\nThe GOP plan notably repeals both the individual and employer mandates. A document outlining the plan states, \u201cIf consumers do not want to buy coverage, they don\u2019t have to.\u201d Likewise, the proposal would repeal dozens of new taxes and fees under ObamaCare.\n\nDemocrats have panned the Republican alternative to ObamaCare, stating that it does not provide the coverage offered under the Affordable Care Act. The GOP blueprint will likely also provoke criticism for its method of paying for the plan. The New York Times reports:\n\nTheir plan includes a potentially explosive proposal: Workers would have to pay federal income tax on the value of employer-provided health benefits that exceed certain annual thresholds \u2014 $12,000 for individuals and $30,000 for families. Health benefits above those levels would be treated and taxed as regular income for the employee. The thresholds would increase over time.\n\nMedia outlets note that the GOP's latest healthcare proposal is similar to those they have submitted in the past. But an aide familiar with the plan explains why:\n\nOne of the reasons that you don't see massive changes is we thought we had a decent product last year based on feedback as we've talked with governors, with industry. A lot of industry frankly thinks this is a very durable, sustainable, credible alternative from a market perspective, and they think it's operationally viable.\n\nRepublican aides state that GOP leaders are awaiting further input from governors and legislators before moving forward on any particular plan, says Fox News.\n\nIt seems that many Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill have in common the notion that the Constitution is merely a guidebook for policies that can be accepted or refuted depending on the scenario.\n\nHowever, not all Republicans support the GOP \"alternative\" to ObamaCare. Potential 2016 GOP presidential contender Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky.) suggested something that has become a radical idea when he joined Greta Van Susteren on Fox News\u2019 On The Record and discussed repealing the Affordable Care Act. Van Susteren asked what Americans would be left with regarding their healthcare options if ObamaCare were to be repealed. \u201cWe could try freedom for a while,\" Paul replied. \"We had it a long time. That\u2019s where you sell something and I agree to buy it because I like it.\u201d He added that that is how most marketplaces already operate. \u201cI think it might work. It works everywhere else,\u201d he noted.\n\nOther constitutionalists have concurred with Senator Paul that the best solution would be for the federal government to actually follow the U.S. Constitution and stay out of healthcare entirely. Government meddling \u2014 particularly at the federal level \u2014 in the healthcare markets, is what has caused many of the problems that have led to calls for \"reform\" in the first place. True free market healthcare, where individuals can work directly with their doctors and where prices are transparent and competitive, would be far better for all Americans, including those who have difficulty affording insurance under today's system.\n\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court is preparing to oversee a challenge to ObamaCare\u2019s subsidies for private insurance for those who do not have access to them through their jobs. If the high court strikes down that provision, millions of consumers would lose coverage.\n\nAnd Republicans are looking to the Supreme Court for further guidance, according to an aide:\n\nAs soon as we get feedback we are going to keep updating our proposal because now there is a different sense of urgency being in the majority to try to put something together, especially as we are headed to 2017. Not to mention what the Supreme Court may decide on June 30.\n\nMost are not expecting a final version of the Republican plan to come up for a vote until after the presidential election in 2016. One GOP aide commented,\n\nLet's all be realistic. The president, who the law is named after \u2014 he's not repealing his bill. So what we are doing is putting a very credible idea out there because what our bosses were sick and tired of hearing is the Republicans have no ideas..\n\nWill this whole thing happen before 2017? I find that hard to believe, but we're going to prepare for 2017.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Republicans, GOP, alternative, ObamaCare, blueprint", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/health-care/item/20058-republicans-unveil-proposal-for-obamacare-alternative", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/20bb5986e7d5b0b9403caa70641a80e6_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "On Wednesday, Republicans unveiled their work-in-progress alternative to ObamaCare, but the \u201cblueprint\" mirrors much of what is found in the Affordable Care Act. by Raven Clabough", "title": "Republicans Unveil Proposal for ObamaCare Alternative"}, "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/20bb5986e7d5b0b9403caa70641a80e6_XL.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce594\"", "article_summary": "Media outlets note that the GOP's latest healthcare proposal is similar to those they have submitted in the past.\nThe Republican proposal changes that ratio to five to one, and allows states the authority to set increased or decreased restrictions.\nUnlike ObamaCare, the Republican plan does not include a federal exchange, but permits the states to run such marketplaces at their discretion.\nMost are not expecting a final version of the Republican plan to come up for a vote until after the presidential election in 2016.\nDemocrats have panned the Republican alternative to ObamaCare, stating that it does not provide the coverage offered under the Affordable Care Act."}
