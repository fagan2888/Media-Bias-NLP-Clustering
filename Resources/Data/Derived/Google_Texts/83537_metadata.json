Here are five of them that will continue to develop during the next year.\n\nObamacare\n\nIn 2013 healthcare was a major concern for many South L.A. residents. With the implementation of the Affordable Care Act residents rushed to the front of the lines to enroll. Prior to the act\u2019s approval one could find health clinics and health care workshops popping up all over the city. Though there were some complications with enrollments in the beginning, the Affordable Health Care Act is shaping up to be beneficial for the community.\n\nCrenshaw/LAX Metro Line\n\nBack in June the Crenshaw/LAX rail line was approved for construction after years of dispute. The light-rail line will run though South L.A. and promises to create hundreds of jobs. Local businesses came together to host a summit for those interested in working for the rail line in October. Though the production of this railway may bring transportation benefits, some worry about the effect it will have on Leimert Park\u2019s historic role as a hub for African American arts and culture.\n\nGang injunctions\n\nThis past year there has been a new gang injunction plan for Inglewood, Echo Park and the San Fernando Valley. Gang injunctions seek to make communities safer by drastically restricting the activities of known gang members. Some people believe this new policy will help while others feel it merely promotes the schools to prison pipeline.\n\nFracking\n\nOne of the main issues concerning the people of South L.A. this year was oil fracking at the oil fields of Kenneth Hahn State Recreation Area. Many complained of the damage the fields were having on their homes while others were more concerned with the health risk they face living next to an oil field. Despite the community\u2019s pleas to cease oil fracking in the area it seems federal funds are still being pumped into production.\n\nThe Forum\n\nThis past year the Forum in the \u201cCity of Champions,\u201d Inglewood, was taken over by entertainment power house Madison Square Garden and renovated from the inside out creating hundreds of jobs for people in the community. The Forum will kick off it\u2019s grand opening with a series of shows performed by the iconic band the Eagles in January 2014.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Intersections South LA", "description": "In 2013, policy makers and community members alike took a stand on a variety of issues affecting daily life in South Los Angeles.
