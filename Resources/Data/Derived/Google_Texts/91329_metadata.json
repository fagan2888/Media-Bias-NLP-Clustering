Some are wondering why this has happened after President Obama promised Americans \u201caffordable\u201d health insurance.\n\nDuring an interview last week, Maria Bartiromo, host of CNBC\u2019s Closing Bell, asked Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini about some of the insurance premium horror stories that she and others in the media are hearing and asked what exactly is causing the cost of plans to necessarily skyrocket.\n\n\u201c[W]e spoke with two people yesterday who so upset. Intitially, her plan cost her, I think it was $250 a month. It\u2019s gone up to $600 a month, the new plan. And then the other, it was costing her $500, it went up to $2,000,\u201d noted Bartiromo. \u201cI mean, the numbers are skyrocketing in terms of what these new plans are costing. Is it just because there\u2019s just a lot more things in there, and many of these things, they don\u2019t even want?\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, they said, \u2018I don\u2019t need this, I don\u2019t need that. I don\u2019t need child care, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m looking for.\u2019 How come it\u2019s so much more expensive, the new plans?\u201d she asked.\n\nBertolini explained that there are three factors that are behind the skyrocketing premiums, taxes and fees, Obamacare\u2019s \u201cminimum essential benefits.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe largest factor is that the essential benefits requires a minimum of a 60% actuarial benefit,\u201d noted Bertolini. \u201cFor most Americans and more than half of Americans who buy individual coverage, there current benefit plan is below 50%. So if you just move up to 60%, that\u2019s a 20% increase out of the box.\u201d\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know, the actuarial benefit is the share of medical expenses for which the insurance company is responsible. The insured pays the remainder through copayments, deductibles, and coinsurance. The higher the actuarial benefit, the lower the out-of-pocket cost to the insured.\n\nPart of Bertolini\u2019s comment on this particular point can also be read as a dig at President Obama, who had promised Americans could keep their health insurance plan if they liked it. He subtly pointed out that \u201cmost Americans and more than half of Americans who buy individual coverage\u201d don\u2019t have a health plan that meets the actuarial benefit requirements mandated by Obamacare.\n\n\u201cSecondly, there\u2019s anywhere from 4% to 5% in taxes and fees associated with the new Affordable Care Act,\u201d Bertolini continued, adding later that Aetna will pass $1 billion in taxes and fees in Obamacare to consumers. \u201cAnd there are changes, the third thing is there are changes in rating. There are more benefits required. There are changes, you know, in preexisting conditions.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo all those things add up to an average increase we\u2019ve seen across the United States, depending on the market, of anywhere from 30% to 40%, ranging anywhere from low single digits, all the way over 100% increases,\u201d he added.\n\nThere were some other good parts of this interview. Bertolini would later dive into the impact that Obamacare is having on the job market based on what Aetna is seeing in its large group accounts. He does note that they are seeing decreases in overall employment and more part-time employment.\n\nPresident Obama has insisted that the cost of coverage is cheaper and that the benefits are better than plans that many people have had in the past. The problem with that statement is that a health insurance plan is only substantially cheaper if you qualify for subsidies (people with incomes of up to 400% of the poverty level, or up to $94,000 of income for a family of four in 2014).\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that 48% of Americans who purchase coverage on the exchange will have access to the subsidies. Those who don\u2019t qualify, because they make to much money, will have to pay the full cost of health insurance coverage on the exchanges.\n\nEven with the subsidies, the costs for health insurance coverage are still extraordinarily high for young people, a segment of the population desperately needed to make the math behind Obamacare work. Some may even choose to go uninsured, rather than have to pay substantially more for coverage than they did in the past.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "actuarial benefit,Aetna,Affordable Care Act,Barack Obama,Closing Bell,CNBC,Essential Health Benefits,exchanges,Health Insurance,insurance premiums,job market,jobs,Maria Bartiromo,Mark Bertolini,minimum", "description": "Many Americans who have been pushing into Obamacare&#8217;s health insurance exchanges have experienced sticker shock at the cost of health insurance plans available to them.
