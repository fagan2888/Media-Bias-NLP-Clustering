They differ in height, weight, charisma, and personality, but there's hardly any distance between them when it comes to what they believe about government and public policy. On a scale of one to ten -- with ten being the most reactionary -- every candidate rates an eight or above.\n\nHere's where Cruz and those ex-rivals who now support him stand on the major issues facing the country:\n\nObamacare -- against\n\nRaising the minimum wage -- against\n\nRaising taxes on the super-rich -- against\n\nOverturning Citizens United -- against\n\nAbortion and Planned Parenthood -- against\n\nSame-sex marriage -- against\n\nPresident Obama's executive actions to protect Dreamers and the parents of children who are citizens or legal permanent from deportation -- against\n\nStrengthening regulations on Wall Street -- against\n\nTightening gun control laws -- against\n\nAllowing Syrian refugees to enter the U.S. -- against\n\nEliminating the death penalty -- against\n\nPromoting green jobs -- against\n\nReducing military spending -- against\n\nMaking voter registration easier -- against\n\nLabor unions -- against\n\nThe \"full spectrum\" of Cruz supporters covers an extremely narrow ideological niche that is out of sync with the vast majority of the American public.\n\nPeter Dreier teaches politics and chairs the Urban & Environmental Policy Department at Occidental College.
