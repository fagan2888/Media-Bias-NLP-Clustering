That included representatives of the chancellor's office, the defence, foreign and economy ministries.\n\nA spokesman for the German government declined to comment on the report.\n\nThe report is a further embarrassment for Angela Merkel's government which faces accusations of hypocrisy because of its outrage over allegations of widespread surveillance by the United States on Germans, including the tapping of the chancellor's phone.\n\nHowever, conservative lawmaker Hans-Peter Uhl told Focus there were \"good reasons\" for the BND to bug Turkey. He cited human trafficking, drugs and terrorism as issues of concern and his comments chime with the views of many German politicians.\n\n\"We need to know what is coming to us from EU-applicant Turkey,\" Focus quoted him as saying.\n\nGermany is Turkey's largest trading partner in the European Union and home to at least three million Turks. But relations are not always smooth. Merkel's conservatives are sceptical about Turkish EU membership.\n\nDer Spiegel quoted Turkey's former deputy head of government Ertugrul Yalcinbayir as saying his country had long suspected they were being spied on by Germany and other nations.\n\n\"Now we need a no-spy deal,\" he said.\n\nGermany had demanded a no-spy agreement with the United States after media reports about U.S. spying in Germany but so far Washington has resisted.\n\nMerkel has also said spying among friends is \"not at all acceptable\".\n\nIn a public spat which chilled relations between Berlin and Washington, Germany told the top U.S. spy in Germany to leave earlier this year after a double agent at the BND was unearthed.\n\nDer Spiegel magazine reported that the BND has also targeted Albania, another member of NATO, for surveillance.\n\n(Reporting by Madeline Chambers; Editing by Stephen Powell)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Germany's foreign intelligence agency has been spying on Turkey for nearly four decades, Focus magazine said on Saturday in a report which could raise tensions further between the NATO allies.", "title": "Germany has spied on Turkey since 1976: Focus magazine", "image": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140823&t=2&i=966468033&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEA7M09Y", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
