Outward. Upward. Downward. Backward. But ultimately, forward. Like life itself, former Rilo Kiley frontwoman Lewis\u2019s third album is a rich travelogue of experience and emotion. The magical joys of love and devotion, the soul-hardening disappointments of infidelity and breakups, insomnia and the ticking of her biological clock, the struggle for independence and transcendence \u2014 they\u2019re all fodder for the former child star-turned-singer-songwriter. And offered up with a narrative vision as focused and clear as her gorgeous voice. Wisely, she counterbalances that lyrical weight with musical lightness, spinning her revelations and reminiscences in the warm, dreamy gauze of classic \u201970s California pop-rock a la Rumors-era Fleetwood Mac, but updated with contemporary tones and textures. Confessional and compelling, pretty and sometimes pretty dark, Voyager reminds you that life is a magnificent journey \u2014 even if getting there isn\u2019t always half the fun.\n\nSong Reader: Twenty Songs by Beck\n\nVarious Artists\n\n4 stars out of 5\n\nThe book is always better than the movie. But not better than the album. At least not this time. More than 18 months after eclectic oddball Beck Hansen released his sheet-music collection Song Reader, an equally eclectic roster of artists \u2014 including Jack White, Jeff Tweedy, Jarvis Cocker, Norah Jones, fun., Sparks, Jason Isbell, David Johansen, Eleanor Friedberger, Loudon Wainwright III and the author himself \u2014 have finally converted all those dots and lines into notes and tunes. Unsurprisingly, many of the tracks retain the wide-eyed dudeness, laconic settings and woozy haze that are the hallmarks of Beck\u2019s work. But thankfully, several artists inject enough of themselves into the mix to elevate this beyond the usual tribute-disc reverence. Cases in point: The blistering southern blues-rock of Isbell\u2019s Now That Your Dollar Bills Have Sprouted Wings; the ominously orchestrated Brit-pop of Cocker\u2019s Eyes That Say \u2018I Love You\u2019; the lounge-lizard viper blues of Johansen\u2019s Rough on Rats and Marc Ribot\u2019s Last Polka; the country-honk of Jones\u2019 Just Noise; the weird Americana of White\u2019s I\u2019m Down; the synth-pop grandeur of Sparks\u2019 Why Did You Make Me Care?; the stirring soul of Swamp Dogg\u2019s America, Here\u2019s My Boy; and even the slow-burning Beatle-pop jangle of Beck\u2019s own Heaven\u2019s Ladder. It\u2019s a real page-turner.\n\nEric Clapton & Friends\n\nThe Breeze: An Appreciation of JJ Cale\n\n3.5 stars out of 5\n\nIf anyone should appreciate JJ Cale, it\u2019s Eric Clapton. Tulsa\u2019s titan of twang supplied Slowhand with at least two of his biggest hits \u2014 After Midnight and Cocaine \u2014 plus a handful of other tunes. They even joined forces on 2006\u2019s Grammy-winning Road to Escondido. So no wonder Clapton is behind this tribute disc to the late great singer-songwriter, who died of heart failure in July 2013. But as the handle above notes, he didn\u2019t do it alone. A roster of like-minded pickers and players \u2014 including Tom Petty, Mark Knopfler, John Mayer, Willie Nelson, Derek Trucks and more \u2014 drop by to help recreate the lazy, Dustbowl-blues minimalism of Cale classics like Lies, Cajun Moon, Don\u2019t Wait and others, along with a few leftovers Cale never released. Sure, it sounds exactly like what you expect. But why wouldn\u2019t it? After all, there ain\u2019t no changin\u2019 the weather, and there ain\u2019t no changin\u2019 JJ. Which is just as it should be.\n\nNOW HEAR THIS\n\nThe Raveonettes\n\nPe\u2019ahi\n\n3.5 stars out of 5\n\nWaves of emotion. And guitar. The shoegazing Dutch duo have seldom sounded heavier \u2014 both sonically and lyrically \u2014 than they do on their seventh disc. Reportedly inspired by the death of frontman Sune Rose Wagner\u2019s father, and taking its title from a Hawaiian surf mecca, the richly dymanic 10-song set melts their usual icy countenance with massive waves of distorted guitars that crash against the rocky shores of reality. Death and heartbreak should always sound so seductive.\n\n5 Seconds of Summer\n\n5 Seconds of Summer\n\n2.5 stars out of 5\n\nYes, they\u2019re a boy band \u2014 with all the teen-love tripe, sugary harmonies and silly hair it entails. But at least these Australian pretty boys are an actual band whose members play instruments, write at least part of their own songs and inject a dash of punk-pop grit into all that syrupy sweetness. So it could be worse. Hope they enjoy their moment in the sun while it lasts.\n\nLa Roux\n\nTrouble in Paradise\n\n3 stars out of 5\n\nMake that Trouble AND Paradise. La Roux\u2019s Elly Jackson has seen the former \u2014 since hitting big with her Grammy-winning 2009 debut, she\u2019s dealt with panic attacks, writer\u2019s block and the departure of partner Ben Langmaid. But to her credit, she still finds some heaven on her long-overdue second disc. Trading her icy \u201980s synth-pop for a sunnier reggae-disco vibe that recalls everyone from Bowie and Cyndi to Bananarama, the singer and multi-instrumentalist not only moves toward the light \u2014 she gets you moving too.\n\nCommon\n\nNobody\u2019s Smiling\n\n3.5 stars out of 5\n\nIt\u2019s a long way from the \u2019hood to the penthouse. But veteran rapper-turned-actor Common tries to bridge that gap with a concept disc about gun violence plaguing his Chicago hometown, voiced with grim intensity and peppered with cameos by up-and-coming homeboys. Depending on your view, these dark, starkly propulsive tracks \u2014 skillfully produced by No I.D. \u2014 are his most relevant and focused work in years, or an out-of-touch artist\u2019s flawed bid to re-up his cred. Either way, fitting title.\n\nMadlib\n\nRock Konducta\n\n3.5 stars out of 5\n\nLess a Konducta than a Kratedigga. Prolifically eclectic DJ Otis Jackson gets deep into a \u201970s groove, stringing nearly 90 minutes of audio oddities \u2014 from obscure prog, psyche and Krautrock instrumentals to National Lampoon comedy bits and movie samples \u2014 into one long, strange trip down a rabbit hole of head-nodding introspection. Get out the headphones.\n\nFreeman\n\nFreeman\n\n3.5 stars out of 5\n\nGener\u2019s gone straight. But he doesn\u2019t always play it straight. Aaron Freeman\u2019s first new songs since fleeing Ween find the recovering addict balancing the wonderfully weird wordplay of old for with frank confessions, self-help messages and odes to spirituality \u2014 all to the strains of sweet \u201970s folk-pop with Eastern overtones. Boognish would dig it. Ditto Donovan and Cat Stevens.\n\nEarthless Meets Heavy Blanket\n\nIn a Dutch Haze\n\n3.5 stars out of 5\n\nFour heads are better than one. Especially when one of them belongs to HB (and Dino Jr) guitarist J Mascis, whose rifftastic shredding drives the hour-long jam that results from this momentous meeting of \u201970s stoner-rock minds.\n\nDeke Dickerson & The Trashmen\n\nBringing Back the Trash\n\n3 stars out of 5\n\nHe\u2019s the L.A twangmeister guitarist. They\u2019re the Minnesota surf-garage legends. Together they bash out bare-bones rockabilly classics and originals full of the T-Men\u2019s outlandish vocals and echo effects, topped with Dekester\u2019s fretboard chops. Bird is still the word.\n\nAlvvays\n\nAlvvays\n\n3 stars out of 5\n\nToday\u2019s forecast: Mostly sunny with cloudy periods. The former is found in the summery melodies, breezy surf-pop jangle and gently rocking beats that dominate this Toronto quintet\u2019s debut. The latter surfaces in the layers of fuzz and noise that creep around the periphery, along with the bittersweet undercurrents that shade Molly Rankin\u2019s girly, chilled vocals. (And yes, she\u2019s one of those Rankins.) If you dig Best Coast, you\u2019ll love Alvvays. Rain or shine.\n\nOLDIES OF THE WEEK\n\nThe Beatles\n\nMeet the Beatles: The Japan Box\n\n4 stars out of 5\n\nIt\u2019s all about the packaging. And that\u2019s OK. In fact, it\u2019s actually fab. Beatlemaniacs, completists and collectors will say domo arigato for this five-CD box assembled to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the group\u2019s 1964 arrival in Japan. On the musical side, it\u2019s no big whoop \u2014 just Meet the Beatles, Second Album, A Hard Day\u2019s Night and Help!, along with the Japan-only release No. 5. And while some of the albums have different songs and sequencing than their British and North American counterparts, there\u2019s nothing you haven\u2019t heard a million times. The real appeal of the set is the presentation. To wit: Painstakingly authentic reproductions of all five original LPs, from cover art, Odeon Records labels and liner notes to inserts, lyric sheets and Japanese spine wraps \u2014 all enclosed in thick glossy cardboard sleeves, individual plastic bags, and a heavy duty slipcase (that comes in its own plastic bag). One quibble: The 96-page booklet is mostly in Japanese. Another quibble: The $130 price tag. But hey, it\u2019s not like anybody ever said the best things in life were free.\n\nJethro Tull\n\nA Passion Play: An Extended Performance\n\n3.5 stars out of 5\n\nSometimes you don\u2019t know what you want until you get it. Case in point: This four-disc upgrade of Ian Anderson and Jethro Tull\u2019s 1973 concept album A Passion Play. Structured as a four-act musical play that consists of a single shape-shifting song chronicling the afterlife of an unnamed protagonist, it was reportedly cobbled together over a couple of weeks after months of recordings were scrapped due to technical problems and bandmembers\u2019 dissatisfaction. They weren\u2019t the only ones; although it hit No. 1 in the U.S., APP is not seen as one of the art-proggers\u2019 high points. But that hasn\u2019t stopped them from giving it the deluxe treatment with this affordable $45 package, which includes the original album and the aborted sessions in stereo, high-fidelity audio and 5.1 surround \u2014 all refurbished by Porcupine Tree mastermind and go-to reissue helmer Steven Wilson. Toss in a whimsical video for the freaky fable The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles \u2014 along with an 80-page book of liner notes, lyrics and umpteen essays on the album, the tour, the studio, the remixes and just about everything else associated with the event \u2014 and it\u2019s clear this Passion Play was a labour of love.\n\nDream Theater\n\nThe Studio Albums 1992-2011\n\n3 stars out of 5\n\nWell, you can\u2019t accuse them of false advertising. This 11-CD box contains exactly what it says: The American progressive-metal stalwarts\u2019 entire studio output from their second disc Images and Words to their second-last album A Dramatic Turn of Events \u2014 more than 12 hours of Rush-like complexity and virtuosity in one simple box. But that simplicity is also the problem. The 10 albums (including the 2002 double-set Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence) come in bare-bones cardboard sleeves without any inserts, liner notes or lyrics. Nor do you get a book, a DVD or bonus tracks of any sort. So while the $70 package is an economical way to own the bulk of their back catalog, this is not a case where less turns out to be more.\n\nIN THE PIPELINE\n\nAug. 12\n\nKris Allen\n\nHorizons\n\nThe Byrds\n\nStraight for the Sun: 1971 College Radio Broadcast\n\nDilated Peoples\n\nDirectors of Photography\n\nGaslight Anthem\n\nGet Hurt\n\nGrant Hart\n\nEvery Everything: The Music, Life & Times of Grant Hart DVD\n\nEthan Johns\n\nThe Reckoning\n\nCaleb Johnson\n\nTestify\n\nLucero\n\nLive From Atlanta\n\nSin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor\n\nI\u2019m Not Bossy, I\u2019m the Boss\n\nThe Polyphonic Spree\n\nPsychphonic\n\nBrian Setzer\n\nRockabilly Riot!
