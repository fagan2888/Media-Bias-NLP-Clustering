A recent report from Leavitt Partners identified six core types of ACO structures, which the authors said can help policymakers understand how to improve ACOs in the future and help vendors develop better services and products.\n\n\"We believe that different types of ACOs have different opportunities to achieve the triple aim and that one size does not fit all when it comes to managing patient populations,\" the report authors said.\n\nMeanwhile, advocates for patient-centered medical homes (PCMH) suggest that PCMHs offer the best opportunity to improve care delivery and accountability.\n\nOne example is the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation's Comprehensive Primary Care Initiative, which requires participating practices to optimize health IT and provide access to and continuity of primary care and other key primary care functions.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the H&HN Daily article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n6 ACO types, 6 different ways to transition to value-based care\n\nMedical homes: A fix for our broken healthcare system\n\n$730 million available to states to test new care delivery models\n\nTwo-thirds of Americans have ACO access\n\nACO emerges as dominant care model despite challenges", "article_metadata": {"description": "With accountable care organizations achieving mixed results at best and population health management not yet attaining the desired results, efforts to improve accountability and drive innovation in the still-evolving healthcare world must embrace the ongoing transformation, two healthcare experts\u00a0write\u00a0in\u00a0H&HN Daily.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "With accountable care organizations achieving mixed results at best and population health management not yet attaining the desired results, efforts to improve accountability and drive innovation in the still-evolving healthcare world must embrace the ongoing transformation, two healthcare experts\u00a0write\u00a0in\u00a0H&HN Daily.", "title": "5 areas primed for healthcare innovation", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/5-areas-primed-healthcare-innovation/2014-06-11", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Accountable Care Organizations,Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Centered Medical Homes,Population Health Management,Siemens Health Services", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "Five areas \"ripe for further exploration and innovation,\" they say, include:Nontraditional collaborations and business model innovation between different healthcare players including pharmacists, providers and payers.\nUse of novel information technology that goes beyond transaction-oriented IT , with big data, technology innovation, lifestyle choices and economic evolution sparking \"endless creativity.\"\nDeeper relationships with patients based in part on the idea that healthcare requires service excellence to foster those relationships.\nbased in part on the idea that healthcare requires service excellence to foster those relationships.\n, with big data, technology innovation, lifestyle choices and economic evolution sparking \"endless creativity.\""}
