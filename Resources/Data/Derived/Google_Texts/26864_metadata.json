It was just one of 11 sessions packed with boldfaced names at the inaugural New Establishment Summit celebrating the \u201cAge of Innovation,\u201d and no one on the surprisingly friction-free panel really disagreed on much \u2014 try as Woodward did to prod them.\n\nA fast-forward through the onstage conversation, which might serve as a primer of Silicon Valley political opinions:\n\nRand Paul, U.S. Republican senator from Kentucky, on student-teacher ratios: \u201cI think we should go a million to one! Ten million to one!\u201d\n\nEric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google, seemed to agree with this, but added: \u201cGamify the lessons. \u2026 As jobs get automated away, the only thing we can do is have smarter people.\u201d\n\nThe panel agreed that we need more education entrepreneurs, and less regulation and less centralized authority around schools.\n\nPaul called out the Internet as a good model: \u201cNo one\u2019s in charge of the Internet, and look how good the Internet\u2019s going.\u201d\n\nExactly!\n\nDoerr, a Democratic donor and venture capitalist with Kleiner Perkins, said politicians and teachers tried to bring tech into schools, but it was the students and free market who really succeeded in it. He waved his smartphone to indicate how. He then talked about how 30 percent of teachers are now texting with their students.\n\n\u201cGovernments are very, very change-resistant, largely because laws are written by the incumbents,\u201d Schmidt said.\n\n\u201cDoes President Obama agree with this?\u201d Woodward asked.\n\n\u201cI would never try to channel the president,\u201d Schmidt demurred.\n\nWoodward pressed: \u201cIf Google had been in charge of the Obamacare website, would we have the trouble that we had?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the Google employees took a leave of absence to fix it,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cGovernment procurement is exactly pessimal for how software is built.\u201d\n\nRand chimed in for the free market here: \u201cThere\u2019s no feedback loop.\u201d\n\nDoerr concurred: \u201cThe feedback loop!\u201d\n\nWoodward seemed confused because Paul and Doerr were supposed to be in disagreement: \u201cYou sound like a Republican!\u201d he said to Doerr.\n\nPaul launched into a series of metaphors to explain Obamacare problems, and I couldn\u2019t quite follow, but he began with mouthwash, which led to eye surgery, and concluded with: \u201cObamacare creates an artificial market.\u201d\n\nMaybe the solution is \u2014 oh I don\u2019t know, more entrepreneurs?\n\n\u201cSo is the solution here to make the federal government into a big giant venture capital firm?\u201d Woodward asked.\n\n\u201cPartially, that is the answer,\u201d Paul concurred.\n\nYes and yes, Doerr said.\n\n\u201cWhat I would like to see is more entrepreneurs. More entrepreneurs everywhere. I\u2019m just in awe of entrepreneurs,\u201d Doerr said.\n\nWoodward continued to be shocked by Doerr\u2019s level of agreement with Paul.\n\n\u201cYou really are a Republican,\u201d he said.\n\nThe conversation turned sharply to immigration, and the bespectacled Schmidt got sassy.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine if we actually did that? If we actually had immigration reform? Oh my God! Wake me up!\u201d Schmidt said.\n\nAnd then, as the session was ending, Paul wanted to talk about the environment.\n\n\u201cThe way to make sure that the environment is always protected is to make it profitable,\u201d Paul opined. \u201cYou gotta make it profitable, and then it goes on and on forever.\u201d\n\nWoodward looked perplexed. No one really seemed to be going after this statement.\n\n\u201cToo much agreement here today,\u201d he said, wrapping up the session.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#ed2b23", "description": "\"What I would like to see is more entrepreneurs.
