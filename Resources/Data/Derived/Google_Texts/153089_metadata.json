But NSW Labor pointed to recent moves to offload parts of Hunter Water to the private sector, including the operation of treatment plants, warning that Sydney Water is next in line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA report to Sydney Water by Farrier Swier in late 2012 explored \u201cincreased private participation\u201d in wastewater plants such as those at Bondi, Malabar, North Head and Cronulla. Farrier Swier's director, Geoff Swier, was a key figure in the Kennett government's power privatisation reforms in the 1990s.\n\nThe discussion paper found private sector participation in treating Sydney's wastewater had \u201cno clear business case\u201d if it involved existing plants. But it said Sydney Water should look more broadly at private involvement, including new sewage plants in growth areas and services such as water supply.\n\nSeparate documents obtained by Labor under freedom of information laws show that in late 2012 the government wanted private wastewater options explored \u201cwithin [the] election cycle\u201d and that finance officials had been instructed to advise on the move.\n\nThose documents reveal that Sydney Water's sewage treatment plants had an implied value of up to $5 billion.\n\nInfrastructure Australia, which advises governments, has recommended that Sydney Water be sold. A NSW Commission of Audit in 2012 also said options for private participation in wastewater treatment should be investigated.\n\nThe consultants found there were \u201cno obvious drivers\u201d for such a move, because Sydney Water could afford any necessary investments in existing plants and there was little scope for efficiency gains.\n\nHowever it said there could be benefit in private involvement in new plants. Turning other water services over to the private sector should also be considered, especially if \u201cfreeing up government funding\u201d was a key aim, it said.\n\nHunter Water has recently contracted out operation and maintenance of 25 treatment plants, and sold its head office. It also reportedly intends to sell its subsidiary consultancy business.\n\nLabor leader John Robertson said Hunter Water was a \u201cproving ground\u201d for the government\u2019s \u201cprivatisation agenda\u201d and the Farrier Swier report showed the government\u2019s true intentions for Sydney Water. Mr Humphries denied the claim, accusing Labor of a \"scare campaign\".\n\nA Sydney Water spokesman said no further work had been carried out since the consultants report, which considered \u201casset ownership, not privatisation of an organisation\u201d.\n\nHe said most of Sydney\u2019s water was treated at privately owned plants, and over the past decade about 80 per cent of Sydney Water\u2019s expenditure had been outsourced to the public and private sectors, which helped cut costs and \u201ckeep customer bills affordable\u201d.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "NSW", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Baird government claims that Sydney Water will not fall into private hands have come under fire after it emerged the utility has been looking for ways to outsource sewage treatment to private operators.", "title": "Sydney Water looking at privatisation, documents reveal", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/sydney-water-looking-at-privatisation-documents-reveal-20140730-zyfsx.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/1/0/0/2/7/0/image.related.thumbnail.320x214.zyfsx.png/1407394349763.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@smh", "image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/1/0/0/2/7/0/image.related.thumbnail.320x214.zyfsx.png/1407394349763.jpg"}, "description": "Baird government claims that Sydney Water will not fall into private hands have come under fire after it emerged the utility has been looking for ways to outsource sewage treatment to private operators.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Sydney Water looking at privatisation, documents reveal"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "Baird government claims that Sydney Water will not fall into private hands have come under fire after it emerged the utility has been looking for ways to ..."}, "article_summary": "A Sydney Water spokesman said no further work had been carried out since the consultants report, which considered \u201casset ownership, not privatisation of an organisation\u201d.\nLabor leader John Robertson said Hunter Water was a \u201cproving ground\u201d for the government\u2019s \u201cprivatisation agenda\u201d and the Farrier Swier report showed the government\u2019s true intentions for Sydney Water.\nThose documents reveal that Sydney Water's sewage treatment plants had an implied value of up to $5 billion.\nState PoliticsInternal documents show Sydney Water considered outsourcing the treatment of water discharged into rivers and oceans, calling into doubt Baird government claims that it has \"no plans\" to privatise the utility.\nBut NSW Labor pointed to recent moves to offload parts of Hunter Water to the private sector, including the operation of treatment plants, warning that Sydney Water is next in line."}
