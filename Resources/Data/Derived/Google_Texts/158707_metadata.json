But two seconds after people said, \u201cOK, let\u2019s give this guy a try,\u201d he cratered. You might say a little of Ted Cruz goes a long way. Voters can\u2019t stand Cruz any more than his Senate colleagues can.\n\nListening to Cruz always makes me feel like I have Asperger\u2019s. He speaks so slowly, my mind wanders between words. As Trump said, there\u2019s a 10-second intermission between sentences. I want to order Cruz\u2019s speeches as Amazon Audibles, just so I can speed them up and see what he\u2019s saying\n\nThe guy did go to Harvard Law School, so I keep waiting for the flashes of brilliance, but they never come. Cruz is completely incapable of extemporaneous wit.\n\nNow that Cruz has been mathematically eliminated, he\u2019s adding Carly Fiorina to the ticket. She\u2019s not his \u201crunning mate,\u201d but his \u201climping mate.\u201d It\u2019s an all-around lemon-eating contest.\n\nVoters quickly moved on from Cruz and tried Kasich. But he turned out to be the spitting image of a homeless man. He\u2019s got the slouch, the facial tics, and a strange way of bouncing his head and looking around that makes you want to cross the street to avoid him. It looks like he cuts his own hair, and his suits are Ralph Nader cast-offs. He wolfs down food like a street person, has a hair-trigger temper, and rants about religion in a way that only he can understand.\n\nKasich is constantly proclaiming that illegals are \u201cmade in the image of God,\u201d and denounces the idea of enforcing federal immigration laws, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right; I don\u2019t think it\u2019s humane.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about his decision to expand Medicaid under Obamacare \u2014 projected to cost federal taxpayers $50 billion in the first decade \u2014 he said: \u201cNow, when you die and get to the, get to the, uh, to the meeting with St. Peter \u2026 he\u2019s going to ask you what you did for the poor. Better have a good answer.\u201d\n\nHe lectured a crowd of fiscal conservatives on his Obamacare expansion, saying, \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know whether you ever read Matthew 25, but I commend it to you, the end of it, about do you feed the homeless and do you clothe the poor.\u201d He also attributed the law to Chief Justice John Roberts and said, \u201cIt\u2019s my money, OK?\u201d\n\nVoters thought they were getting a less attractive version of Mitt Romney with Kasich, but it turns out they\u2019re getting a more televangelist version of Ted Cruz.\n\nThey\u2019re also getting a less warm and personable version of Hillary Clinton. Last week, Kasich lashed out at a reporter who asked a perfectly appropriate question, going from boring campaign boilerplate to irritated browbeating in about one second flat. As much as I enjoy watching reporters being berated, this was deranged.\n\nKasich: Listen, at the end of the day I think the Republican Party wants to pick somebody who actually can win in the fall.\u201d\n\nReporter: But if you\u2019ve only won Ohio?\n\nKasich: \u201cCan I finish?\u201d\n\nReporter: \u201cIf you answer the ques\u2013\u201d\n\nKasich: \u201cI\u2019m answering the question the way I want to answer it. You want to answer it?\u201d (Snatches voice recorder from reporter\u2019s hand.) \u201cHere, let me ask you. What do you think?\n\nWhen giving a speech to Ohio EPA workers a few years ago, Kasich suddenly went off topic and began shouting about a police officer who had given him a ticket three years earlier. \u201cHave you ever been stopped by a police officer that\u2019s an idiot?\u201d he began. He proceeded to tell the riveting story of his traffic violation to the EPA administrators, yelling about \u201cthis idiot! \u2026 He\u2019s an IDIOT!\u201d\n\nBased on the dashcam video immediately released by the police, Kasich had been in the wrong, and the officer \u2014 you know, \u201cthe IDIOT\u201d \u2014 was perfectly polite about it.\n\nWith Trump it\u2019s exactly the opposite. The more people see of him, the more they like him. The usual pattern is: Trump says something perfectly sensible, the media lie about it, then voters find out the truth and like him more and the media less.\n\nIronically, it\u2019s Kasich who has been complaining the loudest about the alleged billions of dollars of \u201cfree media\u201d Trump has been getting. It turns out not getting \u201cfree media\u201d was a godsend for Kasich and Cruz.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Ann Coulter", "description": "You might say a little of Ted Cruz goes a long way.
