Sign up for our morning news blast HERE\n\nA new report suggests Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is being lobbied by key conservatives to say he\u2019ll nominate Utah Sen. Mike Lee to the Supreme Court if elected president this November.\n\nWhile Judge Merrick Garland, President Obama\u2019s nominee to succeed the late Justice Antonin Scalia, is stuck in limbo, conservatives are courting the presidential hopeful to put Lee on the highest court in the land if elected, according to The Washington Post.\n\nThe real estate mogul said he plans to unveil a list of 10 to 12 names he would consider for the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to announce that these are the judges, in no particular order, that I\u2019m going to put up,\u201d Trump told The Washington Post last week. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to guarantee it \u2026 Because people are worried that, oh, maybe he\u2019ll put the wrong judge in.\u201d\n\nBefore being elected to the Senate, Lee, 44, clerked for Judge Samuel Alito while he was on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit and later when he took his seat on the Supreme Court. Lee also served as an assistant U.S. attorney in Salt Lake City and general counsel for then-Gov. Jon Huntsman.\n\nThe freshman senator is seen as dependably conservative, and many on the right still feel betrayed by the tenures of David Souter, Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, John Paul Stevens, and to a certain extent, John Roberts, particularly for his upholding the Affordable Care Act. Lee himself wrote an e-book in 2013 entitled, \u201cWhy John Roberts Was Wrong About Healthcare.\u201d\n\nJames Hohmann, reporter for The Washington Post, asked more than a dozen senators for their thoughts about a potential Lee nomination.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019d be so fantastic,\u201d said Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. \u201cWe should be so lucky.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of Mike,\u201d said Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s well prepared for it, and I think we could still take Utah,\u201d said Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d want to make sure we could hold the seat in Utah,\u201d said Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy. \u201cI think we could, but I\u2019d still have to check.\u201d\n\nOther establishment GOP senators were a little hesitant. \u201cI like Mike,\u201d said Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby. \u201cHe used to be a clerk over there. But that\u2019s premature.\u201d\n\nSen. John McCain said he would prefer his friend Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.\n\nSign up for our morning news blast HERE\n\nH/T: Newsmax", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "While Judge Merrick Garland, President Obama\u2019s nominee to succeed the late Justice Antonin Scalia, is stuck in limbo, conservatives are courting the presidential hopeful...", "title": "DC conservatives lobby Trump; want frontrunner to support THIS man for SCOTUS", "locale": {"alternate": "en_US", "identifier": "en_US"}, "image": "http://www.bizpacreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SS-donald-trump-waving.jpg", "url": "http://www.bizpacreview.com/2016/04/08/dc-conservatives-lobby-trump-want-frontrunner-support-man-scotus-326562", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}}, "alexaVerifyID": "qC73ojZoktel85cbl12SAFJar9k", "fb": {"admins": "10152426200106417,10152720237657852,10200650572686956,3854753687919,100215693385946,549853448412696", "pages": 169204449790211, "app_id": 1502886339979348}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ConservativeNewsToday", "section": "News", "published_time": "2016-04-08T15:12:46+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The real estate mogul said he plans to unveil a list of 10 to 12 names he would consider for the Supreme Court.\nSign up for our morning news blast HEREA new report suggests Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is being lobbied by key conservatives to say he\u2019ll nominate Utah Sen.
