College Station, TX

The redevelopment of Kyle Field continued in a big way Sunday morning.

The west side of the football stadium at the heart of the Texas A&M University campus was imploded as part of $450 million worth of changes to update the Home of the 12th Man.

Controlled Demolition, Inc. out of Maryland carried out of the implosion with a couple thousand pounds of explosives bringing down the second and third decks of Kyle’s alumni side, its press box and suites from above the third deck, and a trio of elevator shafts.

The first deck, which had portions that were built in the 1920s, was cleared out by the company overseeing the redevelopment, Manhattan-Vaughn, starting shortly after the final 2014 home game against LSU on Thanksgiving.

Now, its crews will work to clear out the thousands of pounds of rubble, then build up a new west side, which is scheduled to be done in time for the Aggies’ first home game of the 2015 season against Ball State on September 12.
