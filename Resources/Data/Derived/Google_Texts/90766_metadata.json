Senate Democrats, as well as the Obama administration, have backed that initiative, but Republicans leading both chambers of Congress have been more skeptical.\n\nInstead, GOP lawmakers argued that Puerto Rico needs to do more to address its fiscal troubles and also provide more information to Congress detailing the situation.\n\nThe bill offered up in the Senate would not offer bankruptcy powers but instead would make available up to $3 billion in federal funds, offset by rescinding unused ObamaCare dollars.\n\nPuerto Ricans would also see their payroll taxes cut in half for the next five years in an effort to free up dollars on the island to boost its economy.\n\nThe bill also calls for a host of studies into Puerto Rico\u2019s finances and creates a new \u201cFinancial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority\u201d to oversee its books. The authority would review financial plans and budgets for Puerto Rican agencies, and a chief financial officer for the island would be created.\n\nThe authority would also have the power to borrow on behalf of Puerto Rico, but lawmakers specifically pointed out that that borrowing would not be backed by the United States government, lest it be considered a \u201cbailout\u201d of the island.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Puerto Rico could receive up to $3 billion in federal assistance.", "description": "Puerto Rico could receive up to $3 billion in federal assistance.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Peter Schroeder", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Puerto Rico could receive up to $3 billion in federal assistance.", "title": "Senate Republicans unveil Puerto Rico relief bill", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/262758-senate-republicans-unveil-puerto-rico-relief-bill", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/262758-senate-republicans-unveil-puerto-rico-relief-bill", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-12-10T09:18-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Peter Schroeder", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-10T09:18:46-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "keywords": ",Lisa Murkowski, Chuck Grassley, Orrin Hatch,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/262758-senate-republicans-unveil-puerto-rico-relief-bill", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Puerto Rico could receive up to $3 billion in federal assistance.", "card": "summary", "title": "Senate Republicans unveil Puerto Rico relief bill"}, "dcterms.title": "Senate Republicans unveil Puerto Rico relief bill"}, "article_summary": "Puerto Rico could receive up to $3 billion in federal assistance under a bill unveiled by Senate Republicans Wednesday.\nThe legislation is aimed at providing some fiscal relief to the debt-laden island but stops short of granting Puerto Rico bankruptcy protection, which had been the top request from territory officials.\nInstead, GOP lawmakers argued that Puerto Rico needs to do more to address its fiscal troubles and also provide more information to Congress detailing the situation.\nADVERTISEMENTInstead, the GOP effort to provide assistance to Puerto Rico, which is at risk of being unable to make debt payments, is aimed at providing direct dollars, tax breaks and additional review of its finances.\nSenate panel delays email privacy vote amid concerns MORE (R-Iowa), one of the three lead sponsors on the bill."}
