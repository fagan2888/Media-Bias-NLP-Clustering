Asked by Madrigal what Morrell would tell him if Madrigal were a chicken, Morell said: \"It's barbaric. It's stupid, and there's a better life for you.\"\n\n\"I'm a chicken, I didn't understand a word you (expletive) said,\" Madrigal responded, to which Morrell answered with an audible exhale.\n\nGov. Bobby Jindal has since signed into law the strengthened cockfighting penalties.\n\nThe segment ended with Madrigal, wearing a beanie and hooded sweatshirt, running up concrete stairs while cradling a chicken to the tune of \"Rocky.\"\n\nWednesday wasn't Comedy Central's first crack at chicken boxing. Incoming host of CBS's \"The Late Show\" comedian Stephen Colbert also spoofed the Louisiana Legislature's debate of the sport in April on \"The Colbert Report,\" a show of a similar format that follows Stewart's show. Colbert, a mock conservative, cheered Guillory for \"trying to keep big government out of our chicken sporting events.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "2014 legislature, animal bills, bobby jindal, br-homepage, br-news, homepage, louisiana legislature, louisiana politics, news, tv", "title": "'The Daily Show' visits Louisiana for segment on chicken boxing", "og": {"site_name": "NOLA.com", "description": "Louisiana once again commandeered the late-night spotlight Wednesday (June 18) as a result of its legislative debate during the recent session on the purported sport of chicken boxing. &nbsp; This time, Jon Stewart's \"The Daily Show\" sent one of its...", "title": "'The Daily Show' visits Louisiana for segment on chicken boxing", "url": "http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/06/the_daily_show_visits_louisian.html", "image": "http://image.nola.com/home/nola-media/width620/img/politics/photo/daily-show-grabjpg-46a801e0f41a4579.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Louisiana once again commandeered the late-night spotlight Wednesday (June 18) as a result of its legislative debate during the recent session on the purported sport of chicken boxing. &nbsp; This time, Jon Stewart's \"The Daily Show\" sent one of its...", "creator": "@emilymlane", "image": "http://image.nola.com/home/nola-media/width620/img/politics/photo/daily-show-grabjpg-46a801e0f41a4579.jpg", "title": "'The Daily Show' visits Louisiana for segment on chicken boxing", "site": "@nolanews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Thursday, June 19, 2014,  9:47 AM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NOLA.com", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/EmilyLaneReporter"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, June 19, 2014,  9:41 AM", "article_author": "Emily Lane, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune", "Description": "Louisiana once again commandeered the late-night spotlight Wednesday (June 18) as a result of its legislative debate during the recent session on the purported sport of chicken boxing. &nbsp; This time, Jon Stewart's \"The Daily Show\" sent one of its comedian/correspondents from its filming location of&nbsp;New York City to the bayou to experience the mix of seriousness and absurdity surrounding the practice some lawmakers and animal activists claim is a spinoff of cockfighting. &nbsp; &nbsp; The segment titled \"Chicken boxing vs. cockfighting\" on Comedy Central's long-running mock news broadcast features interviews with state Sen.
