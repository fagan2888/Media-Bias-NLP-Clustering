The Mon­gols pierced holes in­to the hands of their fe­male Ja­pan­ese cap­tives. They threaded ropes through the holes to con­nect the wo­men to­geth­er in a long line, and made them march ahead of the Mon­gol sol­diers as a hu­man shield, lead­ing in­to Ja­pan’s fort­resses.

This is said to have taken place in the late 13th cen­tury. But the ter­rible story of hu­man shields doesn’t end there.

There are new re­ports this week that the As­sad re­gime in Syr­ia is mov­ing troops in­to ci­vil­ian areas ahead of a pos­sible U.S. mis­sile strike, and pos­sibly pla­cing pris­on­ers in mil­it­ary sites. It’s the kind of jaw-drop­ping mil­it­ary tac­tic that is typ­ic­ally scorned by the in­ter­na­tion­al com­munity, and ex­pli­citly banned by the Fourth Geneva Con­ven­tion (of which Syr­ia is a party). It’s also the kind of tac­tic that, if used dur­ing a pos­sible U.S. strike, has the po­ten­tial to com­pletely de­ter and de­grade the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion’s plans for quick, re­l­at­ively pain­less, and lim­ited ac­tion.

This isn’t the first time we’ve heard of the Syr­i­an re­gime pos­sibly us­ing hu­man shields. The U.N. an­nu­al re­port on Chil­dren and Armed Con­flict re­leased in June 2012 in­cluded the Syr­i­an armed forces on the list of parties that re­cruit, use, or ab­use chil­dren in armed con­flict. The re­port spe­cific­ally ac­cused Syr­i­an troops of us­ing chil­dren as young as 8 as hu­man shields dur­ing raids. In March, based on wit­ness re­ports, Hu­man Rights Watch ac­cused the Syr­i­an gov­ern­ment of hav­ing “en­dangered loc­al res­id­ents by for­cing them to march in front of the army dur­ing re­cent ar­rest op­er­a­tions, troop move­ments, and at­tacks on towns and vil­lages in north­ern Syr­ia.”

Among tyr­an­nic­al re­gimes, the use of hu­man shields has an in­fam­ous re­cent his­tory. NATO wor­ried that forces loy­al to Libya’s Muam­mar el-Qad­dafi were us­ing ci­vil­ians to pro­tect them­selves in April 2011. Liby­an rebels claimed that Au­gust that the gov­ern­ment was us­ing hu­man shields in Qad­dafi’s birth­place of Sirte.

But per­haps the most no­tori­ous re­cent pro­ponent of hu­man shields was Ir­aq’s Sad­dam Hus­sein. Hus­sein used “thou­sands of for­eign and Ir­aqi ci­vil­ians as hu­man shields in bids to ma­nip­u­late do­mest­ic and in­ter­na­tion­al opin­ion and de­ter mil­it­ary ac­tion against his re­gime” when he was in con­flict with the West, ac­cord­ing to a Janu­ary 2003 CIA re­port. The CIA al­leges that in 1990, Hus­sein “held more than 800 West­ern, Ja­pan­ese, and Kuwaiti na­tion­als” in Ir­aq and Kuwait to de­fend his re­gime from an at­tack to end its in­va­sion of Kuwait. In 1997, Hus­sein “en­ticed or co­erced” thou­sands of Ir­aqi ci­vil­ians to act as vol­un­tary hu­man shields to ward against an at­tack after Ir­aq re­fused to let U.N. in­spect­ors in­to some sites. Ir­aqi men, wo­men, and chil­dren served as hu­man shields at roughly 80 palaces and fa­cil­it­ies dur­ing the crisis.

The CIA re­port was re­leased at a sig­ni­fic­ant time, just months ahead of “shock and awe” and the be­gin­ning of Amer­ica’s war with Ir­aq. For his part, Pres­id­ent Bush warned in a Feb­ru­ary 2003 speech that Hus­sein “re­gards the Ir­aqi people as hu­man shields.” The CIA re­port ex­pressed con­cern that the Ir­aqi re­gime was again pre­par­ing to use hu­man shields ahead of a co­ali­tion strike, and was act­ively court­ing vo­lun­teers from in­ter­na­tion­al an­ti­war groups.

Those vo­lun­teers, in­clud­ing Amer­ic­an and Brit­ish act­iv­ists, showed up and were wel­comed with open arms. They stayed in cushy Bagh­dad ho­tels, and it was “al­most like be­ing on hol­i­day,” one of the act­iv­ists said in a March 2013 BBC in­ter­view. To their chag­rin, the act­iv­ists wound up be­ing moved by an Ir­aqi li­ais­on to in­fra­struc­ture sites, not big ci­vil­ian areas. By the time the bomb­ings oc­curred, there were between 25 and 100 hu­man-shield act­iv­ists in the coun­try, and none of the sites they were pro­tect­ing were hit.

Now act­iv­ists have ar­rived in Syr­ia, too. Ac­cord­ing to Ir­an’s PressTV and Rus­sia’s RT, Syr­i­ans call­ing them­selves a hu­man shield have crowded around some mil­it­ary build­ings in the coun­try. “I’m a nor­mal cit­izen, I’m not a gov­ern­ment em­ploy­ee, and I do not do any­thing in the gov­ern­ment,” a wo­man says in an in­ter­view with PressTV. “When I heard about this cam­paign, I came with my fam­ily.”

An­ti­war pro­test­ers with du­bi­ous back­ing and re­ports of re­gime use of hu­man shields didn’t work to halt a U.S. at­tack on Ir­aq in 2003. With a po­ten­tial hu­man-shield crisis on our hands again, we’ll soon see if a pos­sible ci­vil­ian dis­aster can be avoided.
