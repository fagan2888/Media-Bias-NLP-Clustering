DES MOINES — The Democratic Party is fighting a wifi war with the Republicans.

After the Republican National Committee's Internet password was "StopHillary" at its debate in Milwaukee last week, the Democrats went a different route for their own event in Des Moines tonight.

The network name in the press filing center? "13MillionNewJobs"

Its password? "No password. The Democratic Party is the party of inclusion and we believe in expanding access and economic opportunity for all."
