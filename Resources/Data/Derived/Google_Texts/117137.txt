The producers of the Pepsi Gulf Coast Jam are inviting you to play "The Producer Game"

On the Gulf Coast Jam Facebook page they have posted a picture of 12 different artists that could headline each night of the event.

The challenge is you have to guess which three artists will be the headliners and which night they will perform.

Anyone who guesses the correct performers and puts them in the right order will be put into a drawing for the grand prize, which organizers with the event say is worth $8,000.

"It's just fun, and it's just basically getting ready to announce, the first of March we announce," explained Rendy Lovelady, Executive Producer of the Pepsi Gulf Coast Jam. "It's just a way of helping the locals feel the love and have an opportunity to win something."

In order to qualify you have to comment on the post of the Gulf Coast Jam Facebook page, a direct link to that page is attached to this article.
