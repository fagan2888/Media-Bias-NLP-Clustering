(Published Wednesday, March 19, 2014)\n\nCrews worked through the night to repair a broken sewer main that sent 5,000 gallons of sewage per minute into the creek at the Valley Forge National Historical Park.\n\nThe break occurred in the Valley Creek Trunk Sewer Force Main Tuesday morning near the intersection of Routes 252 and 23 in Tredyffrin Township, Chester County, Pa., according to township officials.\n\nThe 30-inch main is shared by Tredyffrin Township, Easttown Township, East Whiteland Township, Malvern Borough and Willistown Township.\n\nSewer Leak at Valley Forge Park\n\nWater gushed onto the roadway at the intersection of Route 252 and Yellow Springs Road in Valley Forge Park causing traffic problems. (Published Tuesday, March 18, 2014)\n\nPark rangers and police said water from the broken sewer main pushed through Route 23 in the park around 11 a.m. Tuesday and spilled off the side of the road.\n\nOfficials say the same main also broke six weeks ago, though they have not yet determined the cause of that break or the most recent one.\n\n\"I don't want to speculate right now,\" said William Martin, a Tredyffrin Township worker. \"We've engaged other consultants to give us a long-term assessment of the pipe.\"\n\nOvernight crews removed the pipe. A new pipe is expected to arrive at the scene around 7 a.m. Wednesday.\n\n\"We're working as fast as we can,\" Martin said. \"Really it's a time game to get the pipe back in the ground.\"\n\nThe following roads that run through the park are closed:\n\nRoute 23 eastbound from Davis Road to Rt. 252\n\nRoute 23 westbound from N. Gulph Road to Rt. 252\n\nRoute 252 is closed northbound from the Pa. Turnpike\n\nNorth and South Outer Line Drives\n\nGulph Road is closed from Thomas Road to Rt. 23\n\nYellow Springs Road is closed at the Covered Bridge\n\nPublic works officials expect these sections of road in the immediate area to be closed for several days as construction crews continue to repair the damaged water main and resurface portions of the street.\n\nA PennDOT official told NBC10 that the broken main caused thousands of gallons of sewage per minute to leak into the Valley Creek, which feeds into the Schuylkill River. Officials say more than three million gallons of sewage may be in the creek.\n\nOfficials say the sewage leak doesn't pose a threat to humans but could be a safety concern for wildlife in the area.\n\nNBC10 reached out to the Pa. Department of Environmental Protection asking how the leak could impact the surrounding area and the towns downriver, but officials have not responded to our calls.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A broken sewer main closed all of the roads that run through Valley Forge National Historical Park and caused thousands of gallons of sewage to leak into the creek.", "title": "Broken Sewer Main Leaks Sewage, Closes Roads at Valley Forge Park", "og": {"site_name": "NBC 10 Philadelphia", "description": "A broken sewer main closed all of the roads that run through Valley Forge National Historical Park and caused thousands of gallons of sewage to leak into the creek.", "title": "Millions of Gallons of Sewage Leaked at Valley Forge", "url": "http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Broken-Sewer-Main-Leaks-Sewage-Closes-Roads-at-Valley-Forge-Park-250845851.html", "image": "http://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/images/1200*900/valley+forge+water+main+break.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A broken sewer main closed all of the roads that run through Valley Forge National Historical Park and caused thousands of gallons of sewage to leak into the creek.", "title": "Millions of Gallons of Sewage Leaked at Valley Forge", "url": "http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Broken-Sewer-Main-Leaks-Sewage-Closes-Roads-at-Valley-Forge-Park-250845851.html", "image": "http://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/images/1200*900/valley+forge+water+main+break.JPG?ak=bc", "creator": "@nbcphiladelphia", "site": "@nbcphiladelphia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "taboola_lead": "video", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 196375740321}, "keywords": "sewer main, Valley Forge Park, sewage, leak, water main, Schuylkill River", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/nbcphiladelphia"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "sewer main, Valley Forge Park, sewage, leak, water main, Schuylkill River"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda0d9\"", "article_summary": "Sewer Leak at Valley Forge ParkWater gushed onto the roadway at the intersection of Route 252 and Yellow Springs Road in Valley Forge Park causing traffic problems.\nCrews in Chester County are working to stop raw sewage from gushing out of a broken pipe into a creek at Valley Forge National Park.\nOfficials say the sewage leak doesn't pose a threat to humans but could be a safety concern for wildlife in the area.\n(Published Wednesday, March 19, 2014)Crews worked through the night to repair a broken sewer main that sent 5,000 gallons of sewage per minute into the creek at the Valley Forge National Historical Park.\nThe 30-inch main is shared by Tredyffrin Township, Easttown Township, East Whiteland Township, Malvern Borough and Willistown Township."}
