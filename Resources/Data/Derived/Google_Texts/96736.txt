JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - It's a boy!

The Jacksonville Zoo announced the gender of its first-ever penguin chick Saturday morning.

More than 100 people came out for the reveal. Guests were dressed in blue and pink depending on what they thought the gender was.

Mango and Mister Big are now the proud parents of CJ.

The boy is named after the two grandsons of Peggy Wilchek, a long-time zoo volunteer and penguin advocate.

She and her husband John have traveled the world to see all 18 species of penguins in the wild.?
