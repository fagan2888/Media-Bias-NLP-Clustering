Issa, a vocal Obamacare antagonist, had communicated the warning following a submission of documents that he alleges are suspiciously redacted.\n\nYet as the final speaker in the three-day event, Sebelius\u2019 comments didn\u2019t attempt touch Issa's specific criticisms \u2014 or any other Obamacare attacks, for that matter. They instead chronicled the successes of HHS and the Obama administration's successes in health IT.\n\nSebelius received a standing ovation from 2,000-plus audience members -- of entrepreneurs, technologists and health-care stakeholders. And she set the tone for her talk by narrating a retrospect that began in 2009 when she was first appointed by the president.\n\n\u201cWe were a decade into the 21st century and yet the federal government was still operating with a 20th-century mentality when it came to technology, innovation and, particularly, the free flow of information,\u201d Sebelius said.\n\nSeeing the need for improvement, she said the president made it clear that priority was to be given to opening up the government\u2019s massive databases of health-care information, and that data should be used as a vehicle to stimulate economic growth. It also should be used in ways that allow citizens, policy makers, researchers and physicians to be in control of their own health care.\n\n\u201cMany times [in the past], information was held back because leaders didn\u2019t trust the public; other times it was because it was simply a matter of disorganization,\u201d Sebelius said. \u201cWe knew that that data could help drive innovation.\u201d\n\nSebelius said much of her time at HHS was spent implementing the daunting mission of updating fickle legacy systems and centralizing data from hundreds of databases and multiple agencies. However, the work has paid off, she said, crediting her department for releasing more than 1,000 open data sets and many data tools to the public.\n\nBy her own observation, Sebelius said the rise in greater government health-care information combined with the administration\u2019s economic initiatives to remedy the recession have led to an unprecedented level of entrepreneurial activity in health care. Startups such as Purple Binder, a community services platform, and Aidin, a Web platform that connects patients to post-acute health-care providers, are just a few examples of companies that have been propelled by HHS data.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen more health-care startups emerge in the last five years than we\u2019ve seen in the previous two decades,\u201d said Sebelius.\n\nBeyond open data, she added that a major culture change has taken place as the HHS has pushed hospitals to move more of their health records into electronic formats. In 2009, Sebelius said only 1 in 8 hospitals used a basic form of electronic health records (EHRs). Now, she said, EHR usage is the dominant form of health recording.\n\n\u201cWe are now over the tipping point, where most hospitals and most providers are using electronic health records,\" she said, \"and the paper filers are the outliers.\"\n\nAs Sebelius readies to step down, she said she knew the positive reforms she\u2019s supported will be continued by the administration, and likely, by those who come after as government continues to systematically improve health care while reducing patient costs.\n\n\u201cThese reforms represent a march of progress that can only go in one direction, and that direction is \u2018forward,\u2019\u201d she said, referring to the president\u2019s second-term campaign slogan.\n\nIn anticipation of Sebelius\u2019 exit, the president nominated Sylvia Mathews Burwell to fill the soon-to-be vacant position. In May, a panel from the Senate Finance Committee endorsed Burwell, who is all but assured to be confirmed by the full Senate when she is submitted for consideration sometime this month.", "article_metadata": {"contentType": "GT Article", "description": "Seeing the need for improvement, Kathleen Sebelius said the president made it clear that priority was to be given to opening up the government\u2019s massive databases of health-care information, and that data should be used as a vehicle to stimulate economic growth.", "pubDate": "2014-06-3", "og": {"image": "http://media2.govtech.com/images/Kathleen-Sebelius_health-datapalooza_2014_LR.jpg", "title": "Despite Criticisms, Outgoing HHS Secretary Chronicles Successes"}, "wssUrl": "http://www.govtech.com/health", "p": {"domain_verify": "6fde23837116ec868cad5f966cf08656"}, "wss": "Health and Human Services", "authors": "[]", "google-site-verification": "YGeeEDFGk0P1HO8tlyROBmRbQvw1H3jzQqXhn0Q55a8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcf68\"", "article_summary": "In 2009, Sebelius said only 1 in 8 hospitals used a basic form of electronic health records (EHRs).\nThey instead chronicled the successes of HHS and the Obama administration's successes in health IT.\n\u201cWe are now over the tipping point, where most hospitals and most providers are using electronic health records,\" she said, \"and the paper filers are the outliers.\"\nBeyond open data, she added that a major culture change has taken place as the HHS has pushed hospitals to move more of their health records into electronic formats.\n\u201cWe were a decade into the 21st century and yet the federal government was still operating with a 20th-century mentality when it came to technology, innovation and, particularly, the free flow of information,\u201d Sebelius said."}
