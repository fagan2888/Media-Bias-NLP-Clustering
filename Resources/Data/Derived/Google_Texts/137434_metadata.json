Just kidding. Don\u2019t tell him that. Ever. But, you can tell them a study from the University of Illinois found the opposite to be true.\n\n\u201cAfter Yahoo changed its telecommuting policy, this question of, \u2018Is telecommuting good for performance?\u2019 came to the fore,\u201d said Ravi S. Gajendran, lead study author and professor of business administration at Illinois, in a press release. \u201cAt the time, there was a lot of debate about it, but there was very little evidence available. Well, now we have some evidence that says telecommuters are good performers as well as good coworkers on the job.\u201d\n\nGajendran and his colleagues developed a theoretical framework that linked working from home, or telecommuting, to the performance of 323 employees and 142 supervisors working in a variety of organizations. They found that those who work from home \u201cfeel compelled to go above and beyond to make their work presence more visible,\u201d which causes them to overcompensate and maintain the same level of productivity they exhibit in-office so they don\u2019t lose the opportunity. While the study found those who work from home tended to have a good relationship with their boss, this likeability didn't hinder or hurt performance; it stayed the same.\n\nInterestingly, if an employee did not have a great relationship with their boss, working from home further improved their work performance. \u201cWhen the employee-employer relationship is strained, and then the boss says, \u2018OK, I\u2019m going to allow you to work from home,\u2019 it improves the employee\u2019s performance, possibly because they feel more beholden toward their boss,\u201d Gajendran said.\n\nEmployees working from home weren\u2019t only doing more of their work, they were being more helpful to others in the office. This is technically referred to as \"organizational citizenship behavior\": apparently, another major point for team telecommute (which we think should totally be a thing). In which cause, Gajendran said offering an employee the option to telecommute is \u201ca no-brainer.\u201d That\u2019s not to say every business should allow every employee to telecommute. Having to ask and receive approval is what makes the process special. It's being granted the opportunity that encourages increased work performance and a feeling of gratitude for the organization. If everyone could do it, employees wouldn\u2019t feel that need to work harder.\n\nScott Boyar, a researcher from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, might agree with Gajendran, having advocated for the option to work from home since it's easier on an employee\u2019s wallet and the environment.\n\n\u201cWhile there can be distractions at home like kids, animals, TV, and chores, there\u2019s often flexibility to transition among various roles \u2014 particularly family \u2014 if boundaries can be set with some self-discipline,\u201d Boyar said in a press release. \u201cIf there is ability to adjust your schedule around kids, you could begin your work at 6 a.m. while they sleep. Break to get them to school, then go back to working.\u201d\n\nJonathan Fields, entrepreneur and founder of The Good Life Project, said that getting dressed, setting office hours, and scheduling breaks in the same way you would at an office also helps to achieve a work-life balance right from the comfort of your own couch.\n\nSource: Gajendran R, Harrison D, Delaney-Klinger K. \u201cAre Telecommuters Remotely Good Citizens?
