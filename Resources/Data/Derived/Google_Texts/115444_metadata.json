Col. John Mosley loved telling the story, and he told it to me a few years ago at his Aurora home with both pride and anger.\n\nIn 1940, the Colorado A&M Aggies \u2014 later the Colorado State Rams \u2014 were in Salt Lake City to face Utah in football. The night before the game, coach Harry Hughes took the Aggies to a movie theater.\n\nAn usher told Mosley he would have to sit in the balcony.\n\nRecords from the program\u2019s startup days in the 1890s and early 1900s were murky, but Mosley, in 1940 a sophomore from Denver\u2019s Manual High, was considered the Aggies\u2019 first African-American player in the modern-rules era \u2026 and the first in the Mountain States Conference, which also included the University of Colorado.\n\n\u201cAs the team went in,\u201d Mosley told me, \u201cCoach Hughes asked the players, \u2018Hey, where\u2019s Mosley?\u2019 Somebody said, \u2018They sent him upstairs.\u2019 He told the assistant coach, \u2018You go in there and make this announcement: All Aggies, get the hell out of this damn theater!\u2019 The team came out and they were asking, \u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 And Coach Hughes said, \u2018We\u2019re not going to that damn theater because they wouldn\u2019t let Mosley sit downstairs.\u2019 \u201c\n\nThe Aggies left. Although having a black teammate didn\u2019t sit well with some of them at first, Mosley had won most of them over. The Aggies\u2019 opponents were another story.\n\n\u201cNaturally, there was name-calling and that type of thing,\u201d Mosley told me. \u201cI had no problem in my responses, because I didn\u2019t respond. It was my teammates, Dude Dent and Woody Fries, who were quite vocal in ensuring that those voices didn\u2019t get out too much. The way I responded was through my ability to tackle and to run the ball hard.\u201d\n\nAt CSU, Mosley was an undersized \u2014 even for that day \u2014 guard and fullback, and a star wrestler, plus vice president of his class as a junior and senior. I interviewed him several times over the years. I always was enthralled.\n\nMosley died Friday. He was 93.\n\nMonday, we\u2019re honoring those killed in service to our country. That includes one of the teammates Mosley mentioned as being especially supportive. Lewis \u201cDude\u201d Dent, from Craig, was killed in action against the Germans near Troyes, France, in 1944.\n\nBut I believe I can speak for those in my generation and perhaps beyond in saying this: As the years pass, as those who served in World War II leave us, Memorial Day honors them too.\n\nMosley\u2019s story highlights that as noble as the causes were in World War II, our nation was \u2014 as it still is \u2014 imperfect. He had taken civilian pilot lessons and was angry when after graduation he was assigned to a segregated field artillery unit at Fort Sill, rather than to the 99th Fighter Squadron at Tuskegee.\n\nHe lobbied the Army, even writing to the White House, essentially demanding to serve as a fighter pilot with the Tuskegee Airmen. Eventually his request was granted. As the war ended, he hadn\u2019t been sent overseas, but also was one of the first black pilots to also be trained in a B-25 bomber and likely would have been deployed soon to the Pacific if the Japanese hadn\u2019t surrendered.\n\nMosley experienced segregated lunch counters in Denver and saw signs in windows of Fort Collins restaurants that in crude terms made it clear he couldn\u2019t eat there. Stateside in uniform while training, he faced more shameful treatment.\n\nMosley could get mad talking about it. But embittered? No. That amazed me. He served in the Air Force reserves through much of the Vietnam War, including as an operations officer. In civilian life, he worked in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, and then the regional office of Health and Human Services before retiring.\n\nIn addition to Dent, many other Mosley teammates served, including Walter \u201cBus\u201d Bergman and Perry Blach. Bergman, from Denver\u2019s North High, was awarded the Bronze Star as a Marine for his valor in the Battle of Sugar Loaf Hill. He was an iconic coach at Mesa College in Grand Junction, and he died in 2010. Blach served in combat from Utah Beach, through the Battle of the Bulge, and through the German surrender. He became a well-known Yuma rancher and cattleman. He died in 2011.\n\nTo them all.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Frei: Saluting John Mosley, many others", "title": "Frei: Saluting John Mosley, many others", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/24/frei-saluting-john-mosley-many-others/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150524__john-mosleyp1.jpg", "height": 461}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150524__john-mosleyp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-24T21:50:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:46:39+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Terry Frei"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc708\"", "article_summary": "In addition to Dent, many other Mosley teammates served, including Walter \u201cBus\u201d Bergman and Perry Blach.\n\u201cNaturally, there was name-calling and that type of thing,\u201d Mosley told me.\nMosley died Friday.\nThat includes one of the teammates Mosley mentioned as being especially supportive.\nAn usher told Mosley he would have to sit in the balcony."}
