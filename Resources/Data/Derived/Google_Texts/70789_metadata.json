A second hostage was the federal government, which might not, depending on who you ask, experience another shutdown for two fiscal years. The third hostage was Social Security.\n\nLike the hostage-taking over the debt limit and funding the government, the Social Security hostage involves something that should be routine. But these days, with this Congress, nothing is routine. To understand the Social Security hostage-taking, it is important to understand a technical aspect of Social Security with which no one but experts should be concerned.\n\nWhen workers have Social Security contributions deducted from their wages, those deducted monies are premiums for Social Security\u2019s insurance against the loss of wages in the event of death, disability or old age. Those deducted funds are sent by their employers to the U.S. Treasury Department.\n\nUnbeknownst to most people, the money is then divided between two separate trust funds. This is a quirk of history. Two parts of Social Security\u2019s wage insurance \u2014 protection against the loss of wages in the event of death and old age \u2014 were enacted in the 1930s. That is when the Old Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund (\u201cOASI\u201d) was established. The designers of Social Security wanted disability insurance enacted in the 1930s, as well, but it didn\u2019t happen until 1956. When it did, its own trust fund (\u201cDI\u201d) was established.\n\nNothing denotes to those making Social Security contributions what percentage goes to DI or OASI \u2013 nor should it. The benefits are intertwined and seamless, all generated from the same benefit formula. Policymakers, experts, and analysts have generally always treated the funds as combined, because of how interconnected all parts of Social Security are. Because all aspects of Social Security are so intertwined, the annual Trustees Reports provide projections as if the two trust funds were combined, and these are the projections most cited and most useful.\n\nAs just one example of the interconnectedness, the funds which cover the costs of disability benefits are drawn from DI only until the disabled worker receiving them reaches full retirement age, at which point the payments are drawn from OASI. The amount is the same; the beneficiary likely is unaware of the change, since it has no impact whatsoever, but, by law, the monies can only be drawn from the specified fund.\n\nNot surprisingly, from time to time, the percentage of the Social Security contributions going to each of the two funds must be adjusted to keep both funds in balance with each other. Though you would think, for something so routine, something having no impact on what workers pay or what benefits are received, the Managing Trustee, who happens to be the Secretary of the Treasury, would have the authority to simply rebalance the funds.\n\nWhat would make even more sense is to simply combine the two funds into one. Many experts have recommended combining them, including the 1979 Social Security Advisory Council, which unanimously recommended a unitary trust fund, arguing that requiring legislative reallocations \u201cis cumbersome and can cause needless public worry about the financial integrity of the Social Security system.\u201d\n\nBut there remain two separate trust funds, and the Managing Trustee does not have the authority to engage in simple rebalancing. Instead it takes an act of Congress.\n\nThe goal of the hostage-takers\n\nWhen Congress has been responsible and done its job, this was no problem. Congress has reallocated the percentage of Social Security contributions going to the two funds 11 times in the past. About half the time, it increased the share going to OASI and about half the time, it increased the share for DI. Indeed, because of a projected shortfall in OASI in the early 1980s, Congress over-allocated from DI back then, and has never restored that over-allocation \u2014 and the fund was projected to run dry next year, at the height of election season.\n\nThis was too valuable a hostage to let go with no ransom.\n\nUnlike the other hostages, involving funding the government and raising the debt limit, the Social Security hostage directly affects some of our most vulnerable fellow Americans. If Congress did not act before the end of 2016, benefits would have been cut at that time by 20 percent. The commissioner of Social Security said recently that if Congress did not act, the automatic cuts would be a \u201cdeath sentence\u201d for those beneficiaries.\n\nThe average disabled-worker benefit is $1,165 a month, or about $39 per day. These modest benefits keep millions of men, women, and children from deep poverty, even homelessness, and serve as the sole or main source of income for about 80 percent of beneficiaries. Without these benefits, about one out of two beneficiaries would live in poverty; even with benefits, most have low incomes.\n\nAnd one reality bears pointing out here: These beneficiaries could be any of us. Even the healthiest among us can find ourselves in a disabling car accident or stricken with a life-threatening, disabling illness\n\nThe Republican hostage takers assert, against all evidence, that the disability insurance part of Social Security is broken, overrun with fraudulent payments. But the Inspector General of the Social Security Administration found that only one-third of one percent of the cases his office sampled involved fraud.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Prior to last week's budget deal, the GOP was doing everything it could to dismantle Social Security.
