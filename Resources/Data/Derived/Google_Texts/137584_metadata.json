Fox, who directed the anti-fracking film \u201cGasland,\u201d expressed the views of many in the audience when he noted in his acceptance speech: \u201cWe can have five more decades of fossil fuel expansion or move in the direction of renewable energy. The choice is clear.\u201d A few days later, Sean Penn made an appearance on \u201cPiers Morgan Live\u201d where he joked that members of the Tea Party caucus in Congress are mentally ill and should be institutionalized. Earlier in October, Jennifer Hudson, Olivia Wilde, Scarlett Johansson, Connie Britton and Mia Farrow took to social media and recorded messages encouraging people to sign up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act. In New York City, Cynthia Nixon, Susan Sarandon and Steve Buscemi were among those who campaigned for progressive Bill de Blasio in the contested Democratic primary. And a story in the Hollywood Reporter reveals that Jeffrey Katzenberg of DreamWorks, along with other Hollywood heavy hitters, is prepared to back Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nThat the entertainment industry leans Democratic and to the left is a well-known fact of American political life. In a new book, though, \u201cWhen Hollywood Was Right,\u201d historian Donald Critchlow argues provocatively that this wasn\u2019t always true. In fact, he claims, some major GOP victories have Hollywood to thank.\n\nCritchlow\u2019s story begins in the early 1930s. Film production in Hollywood had been going on for about 20 years at that point, starting with the shooting of D.W. Griffith\u2019s 1910 movie \u201cIn Old California,\u201d and the founding of Universal Studios in 1912. Prior to the stock market crash of 1929, Hollywood was not a particularly political place. Amid the prosperity of the 1920s, voters throughout California cast their ballots for Republican Party candidates in an almost routine fashion. This was no less true in Hollywood. Movie moguls like Louis B. Mayer of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer were active in their support of the GOP, given its pro-business stance, but most people in the industry displayed what Critchlow calls a \u201cphlegmatic political attitude.\u201d They were interested in making movies and making money \u2014 not politics.\n\nThe Depression changed all that. Salaries for actors took a hit initially as ticket sales dropped. Jobs for writers and for those working on film crews became more scarce too, even though many Americans found ways to creatively budget so that they could keep going to the movies, where stars like Henry Fonda, William Powell, Carole Lombard and Shirley Temple helped them escape their problems, sometimes in films with Depression-era themes.\n\nTough economic times generally favor the left, and as Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal gained support nationally, they did in Hollywood as well. James Cagney, John Garfield, Orson Welles, Bette Davis and Charlie Chaplin emerged as committed progressives. Within a few years, Works Progress Administration money was flowing into town, funding new artistic endeavors and landmarks like the Hollywood Station Post Office and buying goodwill for the Democrats.\n\nWhere liberalism advanced, radicalism gained ground alongside it. For example, the Communist Party was able to land a footing in the Screen Writers Guild. Writers like Dalton Trumbo \u2014 who worked on the Oscar-winning films \u201cRoman Holiday\u201d (1953) and \u201cThe Brave One\u201d (1956) and was celebrated for his work on \u201cSpartacus\u201d (1960) \u2014 became party members.\n\nDespite their differences, liberals and radicals in Hollywood were united in their antipathy toward the free market. Just as important in an industry that was already an ethnic niche for Jews, they also shared an intense opposition to European fascism (at least until 1939, when the Hitler-Stalin non-aggression pact was signed, and those who followed the Communist Party line were instructed to become isolationists). Actors on the right who gave any hint of sympathy for fascism, such as Gary Cooper, fell into disrepute.\n\nThe rise of a Hollywood Left in the 1930s provides the backdrop to the first tale of Republican success that Critchlow tells: the defeat of Upton Sinclair in the 1934 California gubernatorial race. Sinclair\u2019s 1906 journalistic novel, \u201cThe Jungle,\u201d revealed the wretched conditions faced by workers in Chicago\u2019s meat-packing industry. The book prompted a federal investigation and the passage of food inspection legislation. Later, Sinclair moved to California. In the 1930s he proposed the socialization of California factories as part of an \u201cEnd Poverty in California\u201d plan that, Critchlow says, \u201cattracted wild enthusiasm.\u201d He announced his interest in the governorship, won the Democratic primary, and was expected to defeat his moderate Republican rival, Governor Frank Merriam, much to the horror of the California business community.\n\nThe heads of the major studios \u2014 who, unlike their employees, were never swept up in the tide of redistributionism \u2014 sprang into action. Mayer, Cecil B. DeMille, Walt Disney and Samuel Goldwyn made generous financial contributions to Merriam. More significantly, they threatened to move their business to another state if Sinclair became governor, and produced \u201ca series of shorts to be shown in movie theaters across California\u2026 which depicted Sinclair supporters as bums, criminals, and nuts.\u201d The campaign proved effective. Merriam was re-elected. The status quo \u2014 albeit a basically Keynesian status quo, since Merriam worked to coordinate federal and state relief efforts \u2014 was preserved.\n\nFast-forward to the 1940s, to one of the most notorious periods in Hollywood history. Communist influence in Hollywood had been limited, but the issue drew national attention. In 1940, Texas representative Martin Dies, who chaired the House Special Committee on Un-American Activities, came to town to conduct a hearing. California state senator Jack Tenney held his own hearings, with the encouragement of Disney. (Disney was concerned about communist infiltration of the Screen Cartoonists Guild.) The issue heated up in 1944 with the formation of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, a group of fiercely anticommunist conservatives and some liberals that Critchlow conjectures might have been started by Mayer. (Its provenance is uncertain.) Some of the leading stars of the day \u2014 Barbara Stanwyck, Spencer Tracy, Clark Gable, Cary Grant \u2014 signed on, along with important screenwriters. MPA members met regularly at an American Legion hall. Their goal was to drive communists out of town and out of the unions. These were the early days of the Cold War. Hollywood anticommunists were eager to join the fight.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ronald Reagan, Barry Goldwater and the roots of modern conservatism were aided by an unlikely source \u2014 Hollywood", "title": "Thanks for nothing, Disney: Hollywood helped make the Tea Party", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Ronald Reagan, Barry Goldwater and the roots of modern conservatism were aided by an unlikely source \u2014 Hollywood", "title": "Thanks for nothing, Disney: Hollywood helped make the Tea Party", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/11/17/thanks_for_nothing_disney_hollywood_helped_make_the_tea_party/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/bush_schwarzenegger.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ronald Reagan, Barry Goldwater and the roots of modern conservatism were aided by an unlikely source \u2014 Hollywood", "title": "Thanks for nothing, Disney: Hollywood helped make the Tea Party", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/bush_schwarzenegger.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Neil Gross", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Ayn Rand, Barry Goldwater, Books, Editor's Picks, Gary Cooper, Hollywood, Movies, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Sean Penn, Tea Party, Walt Disney", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "For example, the Communist Party was able to land a footing in the Screen Writers Guild.\nIn a new book, though, \u201cWhen Hollywood Was Right,\u201d historian Donald Critchlow argues provocatively that this wasn\u2019t always true.\nAnd a story in the Hollywood Reporter reveals that Jeffrey Katzenberg of DreamWorks, along with other Hollywood heavy hitters, is prepared to back Hillary Clinton in 2016.\nAmid the prosperity of the 1920s, voters throughout California cast their ballots for Republican Party candidates in an almost routine fashion.\nPrior to the stock market crash of 1929, Hollywood was not a particularly political place."}
