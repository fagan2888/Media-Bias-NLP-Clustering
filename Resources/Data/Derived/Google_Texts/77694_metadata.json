I will not take part in the editorial decision-making,\" Ma said, nevertheless reserving the right to weigh in as a reader.\n\n\"I believe the most important thing for the media is to be objective, fair and balanced. We should not report something with preconceptions or prejudice.\"\n\nExecutive Vice Chairman Joe Tsai wrote in a letter to SCMP readers following the takeover announcement that China's economic rise and importance to the world \"is too important for there to be a singular thesis\".\n\nA survey in March showed Hong Kong residents and journalists believe the state of press freedom deteriorated in the city for a second straight year in 2015, apparently a reflection of general unease in the city about mainland Chinese control.\n\nMa, speaking to the SCMP, said the newspaper should be \"objective, reasonable and impartial\" and should not report with preconceptions or prejudice.\n\n(Reporting by John Ruwitch; Editing by Michael Perry)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Critics have questioned Alibaba's intentions for the paper, speculating it may be an a", "title": "Alibaba's Ma pledges not to interfere in SCMP editorial independence", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/20/Alibabas-Ma-pledges-not-interfere-SCMP-editorial-independence", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/china-internet_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/20/Alibabas-Ma-pledges-not-interfere-SCMP-editorial-independence", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/china-internet_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Critics have questioned Alibaba's intentions for the paper, speculating it may be an a", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Ma, speaking to the SCMP, said the newspaper should be \"objective, reasonable and impartial\" and should not report with preconceptions or prejudice.\n\"The paper's China coverage should be objective, reasonable and impartial,\" he said.\nI will not take part in the editorial decision-making,\" Ma said, nevertheless reserving the right to weigh in as a reader.\nExecutive Vice Chairman Joe Tsai wrote in a letter to SCMP readers following the takeover announcement that China's economic rise and importance to the world \"is too important for there to be a singular thesis\".\nAlibaba completed its $266 million purchase of the SCMP, which was announced in December, earlier this month."}
