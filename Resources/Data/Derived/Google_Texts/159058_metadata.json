Drone companies participating in NoFlyZone\u2019s consortium then honor the request for privacy.\n\nIn the next 10 years, company CEO Ben Marcus expects drones to be used as commonly as cellphones, but he said the ever-advancing technology comes with legitimate privacy concerns.\n\n\u201c[The Federal Aviation Administration] does a tremendous job of managing safety, but it\u2019s never had privacy as a mandate,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an issue our industry wants to take on and solve using the technology we have available to us rather than regulation.\u201d\n\nThe company said seven manufacturers and suppliers \u2014 EHANG, DroneDeploy, YUNEEC, HEXO+, PixiePath, RCFlyMaps and Horizon Hobby \u2014 have already agreed to honor requests and create exclusion zones.\n\n\u201cWe can be self regulating on this issue,\u201d Marcus said. \u201cWe already have the technology to create geofence exclusion zones like the one around White House, but now we\u2019re expanding that technology to private property.\u201d\n\nThough free for private residents, the for-profit company hopes to generate future revenue by offering premium services like the ability to set airspace preferences \u2014 say no to camera drones for example, but yes to drone deliveries from companies like Amazon, now experimenting with the technology.\n\nMarcus said there might also be a market for a NoFlyZone business database.\n\n\u201cI see many partnership opportunities in the future with drone companies that see value in the data we are providing,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "NoFlyZone.org allows users to create a \"geo-fence\" around their property.", "description": "NoFlyZone.org allows users to create a \"geo-fence\" around their property.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Lydia Wheeler", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "NoFlyZone.org allows users to create a \"geo-fence\" around their property.", "title": "Company launches no-drone database for private residents", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/232298-company-launches-no-fly-drone-zone-database-for-private-residents", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/drone02102015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:59-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/232298-company-launches-no-fly-drone-zone-database-for-private-residents", "dcterms.date": "2015-02-10T12:13-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Lydia Wheeler", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Privacy, Property, Technology, Law, Unmanned aerial vehicle, drones, Commercial drones,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-10T12:13:26-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/232298-company-launches-no-fly-drone-zone-database-for-private-residents", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "NoFlyZone.org allows users to create a \"geo-fence\" around their property.", "card": "summary", "title": "Company launches no-drone database for private residents"}, "dcterms.title": "Company launches no-drone database for private residents"}, "article_summary": "On Tuesday, NoFlyZone launched a global database where private residents can register their property as a no-drone fly area.\n\u201cI see many partnership opportunities in the future with drone companies that see value in the data we are providing,\u201d he said.\nADVERTISEMENTHow it works: residents enter their address in an online database on NoFlyZone.org and create a virtual barrier, or geo-fence, around their property.\nDrone companies participating in NoFlyZone\u2019s consortium then honor the request for privacy.\nA California-based company is trying to give American homeowners a way to protect their privacy from drones ahead of flight regulations from the federal government."}
