To have an undercover police officer pose as a patient, complain of \"chronic soreness,\" and have a physician compassionately try to help that person and then be prosecuted wreaks of a kind of police state that is frightening.\n\nAny educated patient who has suffered from chronic pain or any other infirmity knows that medicine is as much an art as it is a science. Any person who has lived long enough to have suffered any kind of infirmity knows that few medical practitioners are infallible. Wrong diagnoses, imperfect medical records and severe medication side effects are in my experience with other practitioners far from uncommon. If every medical practitioner's records were scrutinized for perfect accuracy with undercover police officers staged to find slip-ups, there would be very few practitioners left to practice. For example, after an appointment with a physician at an esteemed Boulder specialty practice, I was given a visit summary listing a variety of prescriptions that belonged to another patient.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI also received no usable help from that visit.\n\nIn contrast, Dr. Eckstein, who has been my primary care physician since 2012, has been vastly helpful to me. The homeopathic formulas and other complementary medicine recommendations have worked. He doesn't rush you out of the office before you've had a chance to discuss important health issues He is an excellent, caring physician, who appears to have been set up to be ensnared for political ends, not because, to my knowledge or that relayed by the newspaper article, he's actually harmed anyone.\n\nWendy Baia\n\nBoulder", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/letters/ci_28762609/wendy-baia-miscarriage-justice", "modificationDate": "2015-09-05T17:47:57-0600", "sailthru.section": "Opinion: Letters to the editor", "endDate": "2016-09-04T19:25:25-0600", "description": "The prosecution of Dr. Larry Eckstein, as reported in the Daily Camera of Aug 20, apparently as part of the failed \"War on Drugs,\" represents to me a far worse miscarriage of justice than anything Dr.", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28762609:view"}, "startDate": "2015-09-05T19:25:25-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/letters/ci_28762609/wendy-baia-miscarriage-justice", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "The prosecution of Dr. Larry Eckstein, as reported in the Daily Camera of Aug 20, apparently as part of the failed \"War on Drugs,\" represents to me a far worse miscarriage of justice than anything Dr.", "title": "Wendy Baia: A miscarriage of justice"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "The prosecution of Dr. Larry Eckstein, as reported in the Daily Camera of Aug 20, apparently as part of the failed \"War on Drugs,\" represents to me a far worse miscarriage of justice than anything Dr.", "title": "Wendy Baia: A miscarriage of justice", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/letters/ci_28762609/wendy-baia-miscarriage-justice", "image": "http://local.dailycamera.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/dailycamera.png", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-09-05T19:25:25-0600", "sailthru.title": "Wendy Baia: A miscarriage of justice", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "pubDate": "2015-09-05T17:48:03-0600", "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}}, "article_summary": "The prosecution of Dr. Larry Eckstein, as reported in the Daily Camera of Aug 20, apparently as part of the failed \"War on Drugs,\" represents to me a far worse miscarriage of justice than anything Dr. Eckstein may have done.\nWrong diagnoses, imperfect medical records and severe medication side effects are in my experience with other practitioners far from uncommon.\nIn contrast, Dr. Eckstein, who has been my primary care physician since 2012, has been vastly helpful to me.\nAny person who has lived long enough to have suffered any kind of infirmity knows that few medical practitioners are infallible.\nIf every medical practitioner's records were scrutinized for perfect accuracy with undercover police officers staged to find slip-ups, there would be very few practitioners left to practice."}
