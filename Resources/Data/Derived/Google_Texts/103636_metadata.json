Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) in his new role as chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform subcomittee on government operations? (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nMark Meadows is a difficult man to predict.\n\nAs the new chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee on government operations, the North Carolina Republican is in a key position to affect federal workplace and employee issues.\n\nBut what should they expect from him?\n\nWhile his right-wing credentials shine, he appears more open to the concerns of federal government workers than his terrible federal union ratings would indicate. He plans to meet with employees in a different agency each month.\n\nYet in a political party that trumpets its conservative positions, Meadows tries to push it further from the center. Witness his vote against the reelection of Rep. John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) as speaker. Meadows is also a founder of the newly organized House Freedom Caucus, which apparently feels that House Republicans need to be reminded of conservative principles. The Freedom Caucus, he said, will \u201cprovide a unified conservative voice in the House Republican Conference . . . to make the concerns of conservatives known.\u201d\n\nMeadows has flirted with \u201cbirthers,\u201d who gag on the notion that President Obama is a natural-born American, although the congressman doesn\u2019t doubt the president\u2019s citizenship. He was among the Republicans blamed for instigating the 2013 government shutdown, but he says he never wanted it and sees no benefits that came from it.\n\nIn a committee with a reputation for caustic partisanship, Meadows and Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (Va.), a progressive and the top Democrat on the subcommittee, speak warmly of their personal and professional relationship.\n\n\u201cMark and I like each other a lot, and the chemistry between us is very positive,\u201d said Connolly, adding that both are \u201ccommitted to making government more effective and to a fair approach to federal employees.\u201d Despite his strong conservative position, Meadows \u201cis someone who is capable of seeing beyond partisan politics,\u201d Connolly said.\n\nThere will be a number of opportunities to find out whether Connolly is right.\n\nPay is a perennial issue among Republicans who cite conservative think tank studies indicating that federal employees are often overpaid compared with their private-sector counterparts. Democrats and their union supporters point to a government survey that annually demonstrates significantly lower average federal salaries.\n\nMeadows takes the middle ground, saying some feds are underpaid and some are overpaid. A hearing on the issue to get a wide range of opinions \u201cwould be appropriate,\u201d he said. He would not endorse or denounce Connolly\u2019s bill calling for a 3.8 percent pay raise for federal employees, saying that might not be enough for some workers and could be too much for others.\n\nHe is more certain about the need to increase the \u201caccountability\u201d of federal workers. Among their supporters, that is sometimes considered a euphemism for making it easier to punish or fire workers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got great federal workers across the country,\u201d he said, but those \u201cnot pulling their fair share need . . . to get dealt with.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere certainly needs to be some level of reform there,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s probably too early to say exactly what form that takes. But I have heard from agency to agency [about] the extreme difficulty in rooting out those who are not doing what they are hired to do.\u201d\n\nMeadows recognizes the importance of improving employee morale but also knows it \u201ccan be very systemic and a difficult thing\u201d to boost.\n\nNothing hurt morale in recent years like the 16-day partial shutdown.\n\nA letter Meadows wrote, which was co-signed by scores of other Republicans, suggested crippling the government as a way of disarming the Affordable Care Act. CNN called Meadows the \u201cmastermind behind the shutdown.\u201d Blaming him for that, Meadows said, \u201cgives a lot more credence to my persuasive ability than I actually have,\u201d adding that it accomplished nothing.\n\nHe also distances himself from the blathering birther crowd.\n\nHe didn\u2019t, however, distance himself from birthers during a 2012 tea party forum when he was asked: \u201cIf the president is not a natural-born citizen, then he does not control the military. So the question I have, if you\u2019re Congress, will you pursue some kind of an investigation to find out whether or not this guy is really a citizen and entitled to [that] authority?\u201d\n\nMeadows said \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nGiven the wide-ranging investigative powers of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Meadows is in a position to push for such an investigation. But he won\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even remember that quote. Obviously I distance myself from that,\u201d he said last week, adding that there will be no investigation into the president\u2019s citizenship.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t apply to anything I\u2019m doing now.\u201d\n\nWith an aide\u2019s knock on the door signaling that the interview was over, Meadows closed with the inclusive message he repeatedly pushed.\n\n\u201cI want to hear from everybody and every perspective I possibly can,\u201d he said.\n\nTwitter: @JoeDavidsonWP\n\nPrevious columns by Joe Davidson are available at wapo.st/JoeDavidson.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "federal employees, Federal Diary, federal workplace, federal workers, Joe Davidson, Mark Meadows", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Rep.
