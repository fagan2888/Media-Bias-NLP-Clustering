Nobody can tell me it\u2019s not a senator\u2019s job to create jobs! And I choose Alison, because she will work with people from both parties to do what\u2019s right for you. Send Alison to the Senate.\"\n\nGrimes' candidacy has long been a priority for Clinton; he has already made two trips to Kentucky to campaign for her. The first visit, in February, was his first 2014 campaign stop on behalf of a candidate.\n\n\u201cI am honored to have President Clinton\u2019s continued support in this race,\u201d Grimes said Wednesday. \u201cThis campaign is about the possibilities of tomorrow and building Kentucky not just for our generation, but for future generations.\u201d\n\nGrimes' father, Jerry Lundergan, is a former chairman of the Kentucky Democratic Party and a longtime friend of Clinton's.\n\nIn August, Grimes said she was proud to call herself \"a Clinton Democrat.\" The former president remains popular in the state.\n\nHuffPost Pollster, which averages the publicly available polling in the race, currently shows McConnell leading Grimes.\n\nClinton also appeared in an ad this cycle for former Rep. Marjorie Margolies (D-Pa.), who unsuccessfully ran in a four-way Democratic primary in Pennsylvania's 13th congressional district. Margolies is Chelsea Clinton's mother-in-law.\n\nWant more updates from Amanda?
