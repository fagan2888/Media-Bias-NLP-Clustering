There was no crowd, no music, no television cameras.\n\nBut boy did it get familiar fast.\n\n\"We got in late, went right up and got to see all these guys,\" Favre said during a Lambeau Field press conference hours before he was to be inducted into the Packers Hall of Fame and have his number retired. \"It really didn\u2019t hit me. It was great to see them, but I didn\u2019t have that \u2018Oh, I\u2019m back where it started\u2019 type until I walked into the tunnel.\n\n\"I walked in coming in from the field, up the tunnel, took a left, went into the double doors, it was like I never left. It was a great feeling. It was kind of weird because I had been here for a couple of hours and just walked off of Lambeau. It\u2019s kind of funny how things are triggered.\n\n\"And then it was kind of a sigh of relief almost. Staying at the Radisson, lord knows how many times we\u2019ve done that. I almost felt like ordering me a cheeseburger and fries as I did before every game. It started kind of settling back in as being normal again.\"\n\nFor someone who was estranged from the Packers organization for almost seven years and hadn't walked out onto Lambeau Field since 2010 as a member of the Minnesota Vikings, it's not surprising a reconnection occurred so quickly. For 16 years, walking on and off Lambeau Field was part of his being.\n\nFavre appeared slightly nervous addressing an auditorium full of television, radio and newspaper reporters, but he was never overmatched. Before he stepped to the microphones, he was doused in platitudes from Packers president Mark Murphy, former Packers president Bob Harlan, former general manager Ron Wolf, former Packers coach Mike Holmgren and former center Frank Winters.\n\nThere might have been a time that Favre was afraid his return to Lambeau Field would incite a negative response from a lot of Packers fans angry over his divorce with the organization, but having the stadium bowl sell out in a matter of hours simply to watch the induction ceremony on video boards said a lot.\n\nThere might be some who still hold grudge over the way he forced the Packers' hand back in the summer of 2008, but for the most part it appears all is forgiven. Outside, the parking lots were about to open so 67,000 people could tailgate and party and then go see Brett Favre, just the way they had done during his 16-year Packers career.\n\n\"I think there was really a connection,\" Favre said of the fans. \"I think at this point we all believe there was definitely a connection. We saw that with ticket sales. We see that today, there\u2019s a game atmosphere. There was a connection and I think the players and other people who have been part of this organization can honestly say there\u2019s a connection you can\u2019t get elsewhere.\n\n\"And look I\u2019ve played elsewhere. It was an awesome feeling to come back here as an opponent and witness what this is like for the other team. I had a new-found respect, which is hard because I had a lot of respect for this place anyway, to see it from that perspective. Even though I was shaking in my boots when I came out of the tunnel, part of me was like, \u2018Damn, this is impressive. Tough, but impressive.\u2019 And it is.\"\n\nFavre was asked what he thought it was that endeared him to Packers fans for so long. He thinks he knows, but he said he would be curious to hear how the fans would answer if asked the same question.\n\nHe thinks it was because what you see of Brett Favre is what you get.\n\n\"I know we\u2019re here because of football,\" he said. \"I understand that. I think what I did was pretty good. I think it was fun to watch. It wasn\u2019t always great, but it was fun to watch. But a good man, who has definitely made a lot of mistakes. I think what people relate to me is the genuineness and just (being) real. I\u2019d like to think that when they look at my career or watch me play that they thought, \u2018That\u2019s the way I would do it. If I could play, I would do it that way.\u2019 And \u2018he\u2019s not polished in his interviews, but you know what, I wouldn\u2019t be polished either.'\n\n\"And he\u2019s not polished in the way he plays. I don\u2019t want to say I took pride in that, that\u2019s just the way I was. And I wish we would have won more games, I wish we would have won more Super Bowls, but you know what? I did all I could possibly do.\n\n\"And it wasn\u2019t great all the time, but I know it was everything (I had). And I don\u2019t look back and hold any regrets from that end because I know I did all I could do, I just wish it would have been a little bit more. But it was all I could do and I think people genuinely appreciate that.\"\n\nFavre said he will probably tell a few stories more than give a traditional induction speech. He wasn't sure if he would get emotional. That could happen when he walked out onto Lambeau Field to address the crowd before the actual induction ceremony.\n\nIt could happen later.\n\nEither way, Favre appeared happy to be back here again.\n\n\"I think it\u2019s more a celebration,\" he said. \"Driving over here just now, it had a feel like we were playing a game. And I think it will have that feel to it throughout the night as we celebrate \u2013 a celebration for not just me but for all of us.\n\n\"Because these guys behind me definitely had a hand in, a big hand in, my success. To me its about all of us. I don\u2019t see any sad moments. I mean, this is, I\u2019m \u2013 I\u2019m ready to tee it up! I\u2019d much rather do that than wear this (dress shirt and slacks) trust me. And I think these guys feel the same way.\n\n\"I\u2019m just going to have fun with the night I really am. I hope I don\u2019t boo hoo and cry \u2013 I hope I don\u2019t. But if I do, to heck with it. So be it.\"\n\nmain player to use in blogs, scaleable", "article_metadata": {"title": "Favre on first walk through Lambeau Field: \"It was like I never left\"", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/sports/317020481.html", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/favre071815.jpg", "height": 858}, "type": "article", "description": "<br /><br />Green Bay - Before he came out of the unnel to the roar of a packed crowd one more time, Brett Favre had a flashback he wasn't expecting.<br />", "title": "Favre on first walk through Lambeau Field: \"It was like I never left\""}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/favre071815.jpg", "description": "<br /><br />Green Bay - Before he came out of the unnel to the roar of a packed crowd one more time, Brett Favre had a flashback he wasn't expecting.<br />", "site": "@journalsentinel", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Favre on first walk through Lambeau Field: \"It was like I never left\""}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd57a1\"", "article_summary": "After arriving on a flight from Los Angeles, Favre came over to Lambeau Field and took part in a get together on the playing field with former coaches, players and executives.\nFor 16 years, walking on and off Lambeau Field was part of his being.\nThat could happen when he walked out onto Lambeau Field to address the crowd before the actual induction ceremony.\nEither way, Favre appeared happy to be back here again.\n\"We got in late, went right up and got to see all these guys,\" Favre said during a Lambeau Field press conference hours before he was to be inducted into the Packers Hall of Fame and have his number retired."}
