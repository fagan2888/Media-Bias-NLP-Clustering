Mike Huckabee (R) should be careful what he wishes for. On Tuesday, the ex-governor suggested that states are free to ignore Supreme Court decisions they would prefer not to follow. He\u2019s wrong. But it is unlikely that a conservative like Huckabee would be happier \u2014 or that his political opponents would be unhappier \u2014 in a world where the conservative Roberts Court\u2019s decisions were merely optional.\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to decide, most likely this June, whether the Constitution guarantees that gay people enjoy the same marriage rights as straight people. In an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Tuesday, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R) labeled the \u201cidea that a judge makes a ruling on Friday afternoon, and Saturday morning same sex marriage licenses are being given out\u201d as \u201cutter nonsense.\u201d He went on to suggest that states could thwart marriage equality by simply refusing to pass marriage equality legislation \u2014 even if they would be openly defying the Supreme Court in the process \u2014 \u201cif the law in that state does not already have a mechanism to support same sex marriage, the legislation [sic] and only the legislature can create the law that says a marriage license can be given to two men or to two women.\u201d\n\nHuckabee\u2019s comments were echoed by Bob Vander Plaats, head of the Family Leader, an influential social conservative group in Iowa. Citing, of all people, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Vander Plaats claims that \u201cshould SCOTUS render an opinion not in line with natural law, we should not recognize or obey it.\u201d Lest there be any doubt about how he views the matter, Vander Plaats adds that \u201ca law or court opinion recognizing so-called \u2018same-sex marriage\u2019 as equivalent to procreative marriage violates natural law.\u201d\n\nNow, let\u2019s be perfectly clear. Huckabee and Vander Plaats are simply wrong about what the Constitution allows. Indeed, Vander Plaats\u2019s decision to invoke Dr. King is particularly ironic, since Vander Plaats is calling for a kind of defiance that actually did occur at the height of the Civil Rights Era. Three years after the Supreme Court handed down its landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision, Arkansas\u2019s governor and attorney general declared that their state was not bound by this decision. Famously, this resistance to Brown culminated with the governor calling out the Arkansas National Guard to keep African Americans from entering Little Rock Central High School.\n\nThe Supreme Court responded to this defiance in Cooper v. Aaron, which explained that \u201cthe federal judiciary is supreme in the exposition of the law of the Constitution, and that principle has ever since been respected by this Court and the Country as a permanent and indispensable feature of our constitutional system.\u201d When the Supreme Court hands down a decision, the nation is bound by it.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that, though Brown is remembered as a turning point in civil rights history, it was not itself effective at ending segregation in the deep South. Thanks to a white supremacist campaign of resistance to the Brown decision, only one in eighty-five Southern black children attended an integrated school ten years after Brown was handed down. The most important thing the Supreme Court did to advance civil rights was not Brown, it was its decision to do absolutely nothing when segregationists asked the justices to strike down the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. These two laws, not Brown, finally broke the back of Jim Crow.\n\nSixty years after Brown, however, the Roberts Court seems much more interested in dismantling the legacy of the Civil Rights Era than they are in preserving its vibrancy. If Supreme Court decisions actually were optional, then the Voting Rights Act would still be fully operational, and a 2007 decision striking down two school desegregation programs could be ignored.\n\nMoreover, as I explain in my book, Injustices: The Supreme Court\u2019s History of Comforting the Comfortable and Afflicting the Afflicted, the left-leaning Court that decided Brown, and that later reinvigorated the Constitution\u2019s provisions protecting dissenting voices and the criminally accused, was an historic accident. President Dwight D. Eisenhower once told Chief Justice Earl Warren, who authored the Brown decision, that Southern whites \u201care not bad people. All they are concerned about is to see that their sweet little girls are not required to sit in school alongside some big overgrown Negroes.\u201d He later described his decision to place Warren on the Supreme Court as the \u201cbiggest damned-fool mistake I ever made.\n\nNor was Eisenhower\u2019s \u201cdamned-fool mistake\u201d the only historic accident that allowed Brown to come down the way it did. To the contrary, if it wasn\u2019t for a former chief justice\u2019s fatal heart attack, an avowed segregationist\u2019s decision to leave the Court, a former Ku Klux Klansman\u2019s dramatic change of heart and numerous other unpredictable events that I lay out in Injustices, then it is likely that Brown would have come down the other way.\n\nThe conservative Roberts Court is not an outlier in Supreme Court history. Indeed, if anything, past justices were often much less sympathetic to the rights of the unfortunate and the downtrodden than the Court\u2019s current members. In coal mining towns throughout much of the country, children as young as eight used to work in rooms filled with black coal dust as an endless stream of crushed coal poured down below their feet. Their job was to reach into this sea of flowing rocks and pick out stray pieces of slate, and they earned as little as forty cents a day for ten hours of labor.\n\nYet when Congress banned child labor \u2014 rescuing children not only from coal mines, but also from cotton mills and shrimp canneries and factories throughout much of the country \u2014 the Supreme Court struck this law down, relying on reasoning that the justices of another era said \u201cwas novel when made and unsupported by any provision of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nWhen lawmakers in Virginia sought to eradicate \u201cdefective persons\u201d by sterilizing them against their will, the Supreme Court ushered in a eugenic era when surgeons cut open unwitting or unwilling women and removed their Fallopian tubes. In New York City\u2019s bakeries, workers worked as much as 126 hours a week in squalid conditions where they had to sleep on the very same tables where they mixed and kneaded the dough. Yet when the state legislature tried to prevent bakeries from overworking their workers, the Supreme Court struck that law down as well. The Supreme Court of the United States stood with segregation and Japanese American detention camps. It was the scourge of workers and the staunch ally of America\u2019s wealthiest men.\n\nSo when Chief Justice John Roberts and his conservative brethren gutted the Voting Rights Act or when they weakened anti-discrimination law they aren\u2019t defying any grand tradition of justice in the Supreme Court of the United States. Similarly, when anti-Obamacare activists were so encouraged by the Robert Court\u2019s record that they asked it to tear health care away from 8 million people in a case that is currently pending before the Court, they weren\u2019t seizing upon a rare moment of Republican judicial dominance. They were asking the Court to revive its longstanding role as a vanguard against democracy. Should the Roberts Court decide to gut the Affordable Care Act, the will have to ignore the law\u2019s text, but they will act within the Supreme Court\u2019s tradition of protecting the powerful at the expense of the powerless.\n\nHuckabee and Vander Plaats, in other words, might want to rethink what they are asking for. If Supreme Court decisions actually were something that could be ignored, as these two men suggest, American history would have been much less friendly to conservatives and far better for workers \u2014 and, at times, women and racial minorities. Many of the voter suppression tactics preferred by modern day conservatives could be halted by the Voting Rights Act. And the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and the thousands of lives that it protects \u2014 would be safe from the seemingly never-ending efforts to convince the justices to repeal it.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Why would conservatives choose to neuter their greatest ally in government?", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Why would conservatives choose to neuter their greatest ally in government?", "title": "Top Anti-Gay Leaders Offer Liberals A Surprisingly Good Deal On The Supreme Court", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/01/24/3615047/top-anti-gay-leaders-offer-liberals-surprisingly-good-deal-supreme-court/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/AP931428718661.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Why would conservatives choose to neuter their greatest ally in government?", "creator": "@imillhiser", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/AP931428718661-321x214.jpg", "title": "Top Anti-Gay Leaders Offer Liberals A Surprisingly Good Deal On The Supreme Court", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/AP931428718661.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/AP931428718661.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-24T13:17:53+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/IanMillhiserPublic"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd77d\"", "article_summary": "Justice Top Anti-Gay Leaders Offer Liberals A Surprisingly Good Deal On The Supreme Court CREDIT: AP Photo/Jim ColeFormer Arkansas Gov.\nOn Tuesday, the ex-governor suggested that states are free to ignore Supreme Court decisions they would prefer not to follow.\nThe conservative Roberts Court is not an outlier in Supreme Court history.\nThe Supreme Court of the United States stood with segregation and Japanese American detention camps.\nThe Supreme Court is expected to decide, most likely this June, whether the Constitution guarantees that gay people enjoy the same marriage rights as straight people."}
