As a result, she can\u2019t find another insurer through the state\u2019s exchange, Covered California, that is accepted by all members of the team of doctors that treat her \u2014 at the University of California, San Diego; Stanford University\u2019s Cancer Institute, located hundreds of miles away in the San Francisco Bay Area; and the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.\n\nShe points out that the plans offered in her San Diego home by Covered California aren\u2019t the same as in other parts of the state, thus leaving her unable to retain her Stanford University doctor on the same plan as the UCSD team of physicians that treat her.\n\n\u201cSo if I go with a health-exchange plan, I must choose between Stanford and UCSD,\u201d Sundby writes. \u201cStanford has kept me alive \u2014 but UCSD has provided emergency and local treatment support during wretched periods of this disease, and it is where my primary-care doctors are.\u201d\n\nA writer on the web site Think Progress, Igor Volsky, says in a direct rebuttal to Sundby\u2019s piece that the real reason she lost her insurance is UnitedHealth had to pull out of California along with Aetna Inc. /quotes/zigman/272706/delayed /quotes/nls/aet AET because of state tax breaks given to Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield.\n\nSundby maintains that buying insurance outside the exchange would cost 40% to 50% more, though insurers and online brokers say that policies will be priced the same either privately or on the exchange. It is unclear whether Sundby is ineligible for subsidies, which may explain the discrepancy.\n\nEither way, Sundby ponders President Obama\u2019s promise \u2014 which may say now has been broken \u2014 that consumers can keep their doctors and health plans.\n\n\u201cThanks to the law, I have been forced to give up a world-class health plan. The exchange would force me to give up a world-class physician,\u201d she writes.\n\nFollow Russ Britt on Twitter@russbrittmktw\n\nFollow Health Exchange on Twitter@MWHealthBlog", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2013-11-04T12:10:59-05:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "One woman says she's slipped through the cracks in Obamacare, a cancer patient who's insurer has pulled out of her market and replacement policies won't allow her to continue with the same medical coverage.", "title": "Cancer patient says she\u2019s slipped through the cracks in Obamacare", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/11/04/cancer-patient-says-shes-slipped-through-the-cracks-in-obamacare/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BO335_health_MG_20131031150409.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "cancer patient,health care,insurance exchange,Obamacare", "article.headline": "Cancer patient says she\u2019s slipped through the cracks in Obamacare", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "description": "One woman says she's slipped through the cracks in Obamacare, a cancer patient who's insurer has pulled out of her market and replacement policies won't allow her to continue with the same medical coverage.", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "news_keywords": "cancer patient,health care,insurance exchange,Obamacare", "article.published": "2013-11-04T12:10:59-05:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/11/04/cancer-patient-says-shes-slipped-through-the-cracks-in-obamacare/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "One woman says she's slipped through the cracks in Obamacare, a cancer patient who's insurer has pulled out of her market and replacement policies won't allow her to continue with the same medical coverage.", "title": "Cancer patient says she\u2019s slipped through the cracks in Obamacare", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/11/04/cancer-patient-says-shes-slipped-through-the-cracks-in-obamacare/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BO335_health_MG_20131031150409.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-1472", "article.updated": "2013-11-04T12:10:59-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd810b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThanks to the law, I have been forced to give up a world-class health plan.\nFollow Russ Britt on Twitter@russbrittmktwFollow Health Exchange on Twitter@MWHealthBlog\n\u201cSo if I go with a health-exchange plan, I must choose between Stanford and UCSD,\u201d Sundby writes.\nThere no doubt will be countless stories of patients that will slip through the cracks as the nation gets used to Obamacare, but the story of one California woman bears noting.\nSundby says the PPO that has insured her, offered by UnitedHealth Group Inc. /quotes/zigman/258846/delayed /quotes/nls/unh UNH , is pulling out of the state."}
