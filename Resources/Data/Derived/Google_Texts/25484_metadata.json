Mark R. Warner calls himself a \u201cradical centrist,\u201d but he has compiled a voting record over his five years in the U.S. Senate that\u2019s anything but \u201ccentrist.\u201d We won\u2019t argue with \u201cradical.\u201d His amiable demeanor masks support for President Obama\u2019s not-so-centrist agenda that paints a broad smile on Mr. Obama\u2019s face.\n\nBy casting the crucial 60th vote for Obamacare, opposing a constitutional amendment to guarantee a balanced budget and voting to preserve the death tax, Mr. Warner has been a reliable friend of the administration and its radical agenda. Now that he\u2019s facing re-election this fall, Mr. Warner is looking for opportunities to buck his party for the sake of appearance, but only if it won\u2019t make an actual difference.\n\nBut now the plot thickens. Ed Gillespie, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, has announced that he will take on Mr. Warner in November. A frequent guest on the Sunday talk shows, Mr. Gillespie brings high name recognition and ready access to the campaign cash required to make a competitive race. This gives him a crucial advantage over the two Fairfax Republicans who have announced as candidates. Mr. Gillespie\u2019s entry prompted the nonpartisan Cook Political Report to change its assessment of Virginia from a dark-blue Democratic lock to a pale shade of uncertain blue. Mr. Gillespie should know what to do to make this an even contest. He knows it won\u2019t be easy.\n\nFew challenges are more difficult than unseating an incumbent with access to the federal purse and the advantages of office. However, Virginians, once the Warner record is clearly drawn, aren\u2019t likely to appreciate an Obama \u201cyes man\u201d further representing them in the Senate. According to Congressional Quarterly, Mr. Warner did the president\u2019s bidding 97 percent of the time. He has never shouted anything but \u201caye\u201d for any judge, czar or other nominee put forward by the White House, no matter how extreme.\n\nMr. Warner has toed the party line as enforced by Harry Reid only slightly less often, at just under 90 percent. He\u2019s certainly no party-defying \u201cmaverick\u201d in the mold of chronic aisle-crossers like Sens. John McCain or Susan M. Collins.\n\nMr. Gillespie wants to lead Virginia in a different direction. \u201cI\u2019m running for the Senate because the American dream is being undermined by policies that move us away from constitutional principles of limited government and personal liberty,\u201d he says.\n\nMr. Warner\u2019s crucial vote in favor of Obamacare will be central in the campaign, especially considering certain false assurances he gave to Virginia. \u201cLet me make clear,\u201d Mr. Warner said in 2009, \u201cI\u2019m not going to support a health care reform plan that\u2019s going to take away health care that you\u2019ve got right now or health care that you like.\u201d\n\nWhen Ed Gillespie got into the race, Mr. Warner hurried out with a plea to Virginians \u201cto rehire me to \u2026 get our fiscal house in order.\u201d But he has already failed to deliver on that. The National Republican Senatorial Committee notes Mr. Warner voted for the Democrats\u2019 2014 budget bill that called for adding more than \u201c$7 trillion to the debt and [raising] taxes almost $1 trillion\u201d over the next 10 years.\n\nMr. Warner\u2019s faux centrism has worked so far because nobody has called him on it. Now that\u2019s changed. Mr. Warner can expect a demand for a full accounting of his record, with the consequences.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen. Mark R.
