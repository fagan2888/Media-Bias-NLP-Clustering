The government has said the attack was designed to wreck an economy that relies heavily on tourism.\n\nThe elimination of foreign militant involvement would feed speculation that either Muslim separatists waging a low-intensity insurgency in southern Thailand, or domestic political activists, were involved.\n\nNational police chief Somyot Pumpanmuang said the investigation showed the attack was planned at least a month in advance by a network of least 10 people. \"This includes those who looked out on the streets, prepared the bomb and those at the site and ... those who knew the escape route,\" he told reporters\n\n\"There must have been at least 10 people involved,\" Somyot said, adding nothing was being ruled out.\n\nPolice are focusing their hunt on an unidentified young man seen on grainy security camera footage, apparently planting a backpack bomb at the shrine, and have appealed to Interpol for help in finding this suspect.\n\nThey have also questioned the driver of a three-wheel \"tuk-tuk\" taxi who drove the suspect to the shrine. Two other men seen in the CCTV footage who police had suspected were accomplices have denied involvement.\n\nColonel Winthai Suvaree, a spokesman for Thailand's ruling junta, said security agencies working with counterparts from allied countries had reached a preliminary conclusion that foreign militants were probably not responsible.\n\n\"The incident is unlikely to be linked to international terrorism,\" Winthai said.\n\nThe city-center Erawan shrine is particularly popular with tourists from China and other East Asian countries, and 14 foreigners were among the dead, seven from mainland China and Hong Kong. China is an important ally and trade partner for Thailand and the biggest source of foreign tourists.\n\nWinthai said Chinese tourists were not believed to have been the target.\n\nPLEA FOR PICTURES\n\nA day after police said the main suspect, dressed in a yellow shirt and shorts, with dark hair and a wispy beard, was believed to be European or Middle Eastern, they noted he might have been a Thai man pretending to be foreign.\n\nThey later said the tuk-tuk driver had not been able to communicate with the man, except to agree a fare. The man had shown the driver a photograph of the shrine to indicate where he wanted to go.\n\nPolice declined to say where the man had hailed the tuk-tuk and appealed for anyone taking photographs at the scene before the blast to submit their pictures.\n\nOne of the two suspected accomplices, spotted at the shrine on CCTV, had come forward to say he was a Thai tour guide, and the other was a tourist from China who had flown home, police said. Police spokesman Prawut Thawornsiri declined to say if the two had been cleared, pending a check on their documents.\n\nThe blast comes at a sensitive time for Thailand, which has been riven for a decade by a sometimes-violent struggle for power between political factions in Bangkok.\n\nA parliament picked by the junta that seized power in 2014 is due to vote on a draft constitution next month that critics say is undemocratic. The government has promised to restore democracy next year.\n\nThe government is also dealing with flagging growth and appointed a new finance minister and a deputy premier to oversee the economy.\n\nThe Erawan shrine has reopened, with visitors leaving messages, flowers and candles.\n\n(Additional reporting by Pracha Hariraksapitak and Panarat Thepgumpana; Editing by Robert Birsel, Dean Yates and Ian Geoghegan)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "BANGKOK (Reuters) - A bomb attack in Bangkok in which 20 people were killed was likely", "title": "Two Thai bomb 'suspects' deny link, international terrorism 'unlikely'", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/08/19/Thai-police-seek-Interpol-help-track-bomb-suspect", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/thailand-blast_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/08/19/Thai-police-seek-Interpol-help-track-bomb-suspect", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/thailand-blast_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "BANGKOK (Reuters) - A bomb attack in Bangkok in which 20 people were killed was likely", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda1f0\"", "article_summary": "They later said the tuk-tuk driver had not been able to communicate with the man, except to agree a fare.\nChina is an important ally and trade partner for Thailand and the biggest source of foreign tourists.\nNo one has claimed responsibility for the blast, Thailand's worst bombing, on Monday evening at a popular Hindu shrine crowded with tourists.\nBut they appeared to rule out an international terrorist group and said Chinese people were not believed to have been targeted.\n\"The incident is unlikely to be linked to international terrorism,\" Winthai said."}
