I just thought I'd mention that. Since there were a lot of predictions of doom and gloom.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican and strident Obamacare critic, conceded in a statement \u201cthe economy continues to show some signs of improvement.\u201d\n\nBut Boehner also added, \u201ctoo many Americans remain out of work, and too many are working harder only to lose ground to stagnant wages and rising costs.\u201d\n\nThere was more good news for Obama and the country in the new jobs report \u2014 the unemployment rate ticked down to 5.4 percent from 5.5 percent in March, which is the lowest level since May 2008.\n\nEven House Speaker Boehner John Boehner had to compliment the latest jobs numbers, modestly saying \"the economy continues to show some signs of improvement.\" (Mark Wilson/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s report argues that the economy is in decent health,\u201d says Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman Private Banking.\n\nObama has now presided over 62 straight months of job growth \u2014 a streak that appeared to be in jeopardy after a first quarter slowdown this year during which the U.S. economy is believed to have contracted from January through March.\n\nJason Furman, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, noted that more than 200,000 jobs have been created \u201cin thirteen of the past fourteen months, the first time that has happened since 1995.\u201d\n\nIf that trend continues, the Republicans vying to succeed Obama in the 2016 president election may not be able to run on a sour economy.\n\n\u201cUnder almost any scenario the economy will be back to full employment by election day 2016,\u201d said Mark Zandi, economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cThis means wage growth, which is already picking up, will be growing solidly. Voters will feel much better about the economy when they go to the ballot box.\u201d\n\nBreakdown of the jobs numbers. (New York Daily News)\n\nWages did indeed go up, but only by a piddling 3 cents in April to $24.87. In fact, pay has risen just 2.2 percent over the past 12 months, roughly the same sluggish pace of the past six years.\n\nThat is likely to keep the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates.\n\nA third of the 182,000 service sector jobs added in April were high-paying business service gigs. And only 27,000 of the new positions were in the lower-paid retail and leisure fields.\n\nConstruction companies added 45,000 jobs, the most in 16 months. The health care industry added 56,000 jobs. And manufacturing added 1,000 jobs, way more than had been predicted.\n\nBut there were other indicators that took the gloss off the otherwise encouraging April jobs report:\n\nThe March job numbers were revised sharply down from a disappointing 126,000 to just 85,000.\n\nThe labor-force participation rate \u2014 the share of Americans with jobs or looking for work \u2014 rose ever so slightly to 62.8 percent from 62.7 percent. But that\u2019s still a very low level.\n\nExperts suspect the retirement of a lot of Baby Boomers and other demographic changes figure in that.\n\nWith News Wire Services\n\nON A MOBILE DEVICE?
