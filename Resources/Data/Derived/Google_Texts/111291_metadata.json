In addition, the team examined information from inpatient databases in New Jersey and New York during that same period, using the two states as controls.\n\nThe researchers specifically wanted to find out how many patients between the ages of 19 and 64 had undergone elective surgical procedures (e.g. back surgery, joint replacements, etc.), and how many had undergone required procedures, such as surgery for cancer or heart disease.\n\nAs a result, they discovered that there were 836,311 total surgeries performed during those 7 years, with 22.2 percent of them occurring in Massachusetts; 54.7 percent in New York; and 22.9 percent in New Jersey.\n\nAdvertisement: Content below.
