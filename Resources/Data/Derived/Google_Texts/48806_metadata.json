Our teacher would put on each day\u2019s episode of Sesame Street. With the help of Oscar the Grouch, Grover, and Big Bird, our teacher led the class in the episode\u2019s counting exercises and alphabet lessons; we sat tight during the program\u2019s mini-documentaries that showed us processes like how apple juice was bottled. Class always ended after the closing credits, during which every student danced while our parents waited outside the classroom.\n\nThis memory is probably no different from the memories of hundreds of thousands\u2014if not millions\u2014of preschoolers around the world. The impact ofSesame Street on the lives of children is undeniable\u2014and maybe even more profound than we realized.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, a new paper by University of Maryland\u2019s Melissa Kearney and Wellesley College\u2019s Philip Levine finds that students who watch Sesame Street on a regular basis are more likely to keep up with their grade level. The effects of the show were most pronounced in boys from black and other disadvantaged communities.\n\nMore from The Daily Dot: \u201cHairy armpits for women are making a serious comeback\u201d\n\nAfter Sesame Street was introduced, children living in places where the show was broadcast saw a 14 percent drop in their likelihood of being behind in school. Levine and Kearney note in their paper that a wide body of previous research has found that Head Start, the pre-kindergarten program for low-income Americans, delivers a similar benefit.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean Sesame Street should be used as a substitute for education. Levine and Kearney argue that TV should only act as a supplement to the classroom, as Head Start offers \u201cfamily support, medical and dental services, and development of emotional skills that help kids in social settings.\u201d\n\nWhat Levine and Kearney found, though, was a rather intriguing equivalency between the lessons of Sesame Street and MOOCs, or \u201cmassive open online-courses,\u201d a recent trend in accessible higher education. \u201cIf we can do this with Sesame Street on television,\u201d Levine and Kearney write, \u201cwe can potentially do this with all sorts of electronic communications.\u201d\n\nSuch a development could result in massive changes in access for lower-income Americans unable afford a university education. What\u2019s stopping us from bridging the gap between the elementary benefits of Sesame Street and higher ed\u2014from secondary school through college?\n\nLevine and Kearney credit the show\u2019s effectiveness to its use of storytelling\u2014or as they put it, \u201cpower of the human narrative.\u201d Indeed, storytelling can communicate experience in a way that many people can find relatable, making it easier to commit subjects like math, science, and language to memory; this allows the student to better understand and internalize concepts at any age.\n\nOf course, the biggest benefit of this theory is that it offers one possible solution to educational inequality.\n\nWhile researchers argue the effect fades before high school graduation, I attribute this to the fact that between elementary school and college, there\u2019s no supplemental education quite like Sesame Street. But introducing such an approach to students in underserved communities could benefit those enrolled in secondary education the same way the program does in elementary school.\n\nMore from The Daily Dot: \u201cJimmy Kimmel introduces Kit Harington to YouTube\u2019s best Jon Snow impressionists\u201d\n\nMany schools are already adopting project-based learning (PBL) approaches, which apply real life situations to academic curricula in order to better engage students. The method hinges on the idea that education should focus on developing skills like problem-solving, teamwork, and critical thinking, rather than stale memorization that students will forget in a matter of days. Instead of \u201cteaching for the test,\u201d PBL schools \u201cteach for life.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "New research finds that kids who regularly watch the PBS classic are more likely to keep up with their grade level VIDEO", "title": "What America\u2019s failing schools can learn from \u201cSesame Street\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "New research finds that kids who regularly watch the PBS classic are more likely to keep up with their grade level VIDEO", "title": "What America\u2019s failing schools can learn from \u201cSesame Street\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/13/what_americas_failing_schools_can_learn_from_sesame_street_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-19-at-1.34.14-PM.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New research finds that kids who regularly watch the PBS classic are more likely to keep up with their grade level VIDEO", "title": "What America\u2019s failing schools can learn from \u201cSesame Street\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-19-at-1.34.14-PM.png", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Feliks Garcia", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Education, Higher Learning, San Diego, sesame street, the daily dot", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Our teacher would put on each day\u2019s episode of Sesame Street.\nWhat\u2019s stopping us from bridging the gap between the elementary benefits of Sesame Street and higher ed\u2014from secondary school through college?\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean Sesame Street should be used as a substitute for education.\nWhile researchers argue the effect fades before high school graduation, I attribute this to the fact that between elementary school and college, there\u2019s no supplemental education quite like Sesame Street.\nThe impact ofSesame Street on the lives of children is undeniable\u2014and maybe even more profound than we realized."}
