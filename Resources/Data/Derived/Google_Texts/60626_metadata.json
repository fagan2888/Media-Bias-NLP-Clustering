Two-thirds of East Palo Alto\u2019s current 368 kindergarteners didn\u2019t attend preschool.The district outlined its proposal earlier in October at a community meeting, the third in a series to solicit parent feedback. \u201cWe want our kids to feel good, feel proud, about going to school. We want them to be excited,\u201d Angelica Tellechea, a district official who liaises with the community, told parents at the Facilities Master Plan meeting held at Brentwood Academy on Oct. 4. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to want to be out on the streets.\u201dOfficials said the scope of the planning is unprecedented for the district.\n\n\u201cThere has never been a facilities master plan, until now,\u201d Gloria Hernandez-Goff, the district\u2019s new superintendent, said in an interview.\n\nThe district is uncertain how it will pay for the planned construction, which could take more than a decade to complete. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to beat every bush to find the money we need,\u201d Hernandez-Goff said.The state budget Gov. Jerry Brown signed in June includes $264 million for preschool education. Ravenswood district officials say they are still waiting to see what portion of that budget, if any, they will receive.The school board is considering fundraising and possible bond measures to raise money, and Hernandez-Goff said she was hopeful that the state would match whatever money the board raised.That could be a challenge. Brown is wary of increasing state debt, and would prefer that school districts pay for facilities upgrades on their own, said California Budget Project Executive Director Chris Hoene.\u201cIt\u2019s [decided on] a case-by-case basis and they\u2019ll have to make a strong case,\u201d Hoene said. Brown is \u201ca critic and doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s the right model for the state to just be on the hook for the bill and not have a say in the investment [of the funds].\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "The Ravenswood City School District is proposing spending more than $133 million on repairing and expanding East Palo Alto\u2019s schools, the most major upgrades since 1945.", "title": "East Palo Alto schools exploring most expansive upgrades in decades - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Ravenswood-School-District-Superintendent.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-31T15:36:13+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2014/10/29/ravenswood-district-east-palo-alto-schools-upgrades/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Education", "tag": "schools", "published_time": "2014-10-29T06:19:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-31T15:36:13+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Ravenswood City School District is proposing spending more than $133 million on repairing and expanding East Palo Alto\u2019s schools, the most major upgrades since 1945.", "title": "East Palo Alto schools exploring most expansive upgrades in decades - Peninsula Press", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Ravenswood-School-District-Superintendent.jpg", "creator": "@PeninsuPress", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd754\"", "article_summary": "The Ravenswood City School District is proposing spending more than $133 million on repairing and expanding East Palo Alto\u2019s schools, the most major upgrades since 1945.\nThe school district wants to create a new middle school, relocate the Los Robles Dual Immersion Magnet school, build four new neighborhood elementary schools and expand preschool access.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to beat every bush to find the money we need,\u201d Hernandez-Goff said.The state budget Gov.\n\u201cThere has never been a facilities master plan, until now,\u201d Gloria Hernandez-Goff, the district\u2019s new superintendent, said in an interview.\n\u201cWe want our kids to feel good, feel proud, about going to school."}
