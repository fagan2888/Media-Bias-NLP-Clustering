We\u2019ve got ObamaCare, ready to be propped up with pictures of dogs, cats and other pets in a $1 million advertising campaign aimed at the same young people, dubbed \u201c knuckleheads \u201d by Michelle Obama. We\u2019ve got \u2018Braggadocio Barry\u2019s increasingly loud boasts that he\u2019s got a pen and a phone with which to circumvent Congress.\n\nWhy are they sending monitors into the newsrooms at this particular juncture of the Fundamental Transformation of America?\n\nDress newsroom monitors of the Obama Regime\u2019s FCC in jackboots and military caps when they come to invade because the \u201cMulti-Market Study of Critical Information Needs\u201d (CINS) they proposed last May is truly all about image.\n\nWhen the KGB and the Stasi invaded the news rooms of Russia and Germany, they killed off any who showed resistance. In their mad, unquenchable thirst for power the Obama Regime thinks its people are already dead.\n\nIn their warped Marxist way, they can always frighten to death any of those those still kicking.\n\nCINS is only the fear factor of the Marxist way being made manifest.\n\nThis is the transparency that is there for those who want to look the latest move of the Obama regime right in the face: They want you to feel boxed in. They want you to feel trapped. They want you to believe you are the flies trapped in the capped bottle with no way out. They want you to stop believing in yourself and in your family and friends. They want you to believe you have no right to find any of the few jobs left because Uncle Sugar can look after you right in your own home. And what they want most is for you to stop believing in God, believing instead in the power of the regime.\n\nIn other words, CINS fits like the snug proverbial glove in Obama\u2019s shock-a-day trademark style.\n\nFinding transparency clearly shows they already control the media and have done so ever since Senator Barack Obama came into the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cIn a controversial move, the Obama administration is looking to send the FCC in to investigate how the media chooses stories.\u201d (Fox News, Feb. 20, 2014)\n\nWhat a joke! The regime already knows how the media chooses stories, in fact in the case of the alphabet networks it already chooses the stories for them with zero complaints for the past five years.\n\nThat camel nose we only now see poking into the news tents has been there all along.\n\nThe same media shysters who welcomed Barack Obama as a rock star Savior of the Poor and Downtrodden back in 2007, are the same pipsqueaks who couldn\u2019t form a single-word question when Obama boasted, \u201cI Have a pen and a phone\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cHow Constitution-respecting is that?\u201d were the two questions that went media unasked.\n\nObama puppets always send out their latest moves in serious-sounding legalese.\n\nThis time it\u2019s: \u201cThe Multi-Market Study of Critical Information Needs (CINS) initiative was proposed last May. The FCC explained that it wanted information from television and radio broadcasters \u201cto ascertain the process by which stories are selected, station priorities (for content production quality, and populations served), perceived station bias, perceived percent of news dedicated to each of the eight CIN\u2019s and perceived responsive to underserved populations.\n\nThe FCC (Federally Certified Cowards, for short) has identified eight CINs, or key topics that the government believes should be covered.\u201d\n\nSure it has.\n\nViewers, already leaving them in droves, can easily identify eight networks already disseminating government propaganda as the news: CNN, MSNBC, CNBC, ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, and courtesy of Al Gore, Al Jazeera.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have urged the FCC to abandon the project, which we can take as proof positive that it never will.\n\nTelevision executives should come out from hiding under their desks from government monitors in the newsroom. They\u2019re already there. Look for the boss who\u2019s sipping his double latte in the corner.\n\nFox News, reporting full bore on the FCC, shouldn\u2019t worry. Even though they\u2019ve got gutsy reporters like Megyn Kelly, Sean Hannity, Neil Cavuto, et al, holding up the left are James Carville, Bob Beckel, Juan Williams, Dennis Kucinich and Geraldo Rivera.\n\nRogue Karl Rove is roaming all over Fox Nation, taking out the conservative enemy for Boehner and the Boys.\n\nWould Obama allow the FCC to put the muzzle on Fox so long as Bill O\u2019Reilly, numero uno in cable television, is still kissing his booty?\n\nMeanwhile, don\u2019t get caught up and sidelined by the latest Marxist Machiavellian moves. It\u2019s not the local radio and television networks they\u2019re after.\n\nIt\u2019s not the fluff that the Obama-driven FCC are after. It\u2019s talk radio where \u2018the enemy\u2019 tunes in to the truth every day and night from the take-no-prisoners Mark Levin, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck and a handful of courageous others.\n\nDon\u2019t get too many shudders from the government monitors of the FCC arriving any time soon at the television newsrooms. They\u2019ve been there for the last five years.\n\nUpdate:", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "It\u2019s Talk Show Radio the FCC is REALLY After, government monitors of the FCC arriving any time soon at the television newsrooms.
