Bentley's warm and fuzzy slogan when he ran for governor in 2010.\n\nBut the good doctor's policies have been anything but warm and fuzzy for many of this state's struggling citizens.\n\n\"There's 185,000 working people that have low wage jobs who make too much for Medicaid but not enough for an ACA subsidy,\" said Doug Hoffman in Mike Oliver's recent Al.com story.\n\n\"And that's all because the governor decided against expanding Medicaid and closing the \"coverage gap,\" Hoffman said.\n\nHoffman is the guy behind \"The Blowing Off Medicaid\" billboards that have popped up in several areas of the state including Birmingham, Sheffield, Huntsville, Montgomery and soon coming to Mobile.\n\nThe billboards attack Bentley's decision to refuse Medicaid expansion under Obamacare. One billboard is illustrated with a tornado of money leaving the state with this headline: \"Blowing off Medicaid Closes Hospitals and Raises Premiums.\"\n\nHave you fallen in the cracks of the \"coverage gap?\"\n\nIf you want to help with the cause or contact the governor about this issue, you might want to visit Hoffman's website at EngageAlabama.org.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "alabama politics, Gov.
