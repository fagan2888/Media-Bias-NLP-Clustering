He grows his own vegetables, slaughters his own meat, even roasts his own coffee beans \u2014 and for five years, he profited from doing so, hosting weekly farm-to-table meals for small, exclusive groups of guests.\n\nGrowing a Feast, Timmermeister\u2019s second book, tells the story of one such meal, made entirely of ingredients from his farm. The saga begins a full two years before the feast in question, with the birth of a future dairy cow, and progresses through the months of labor that made its many courses possible. It\u2019s the story, in other words, of how food gets to the table, in far more detail than most of us are likely to have seen for ourselves. In many ways, it\u2019s a beautiful story \u2014 but it\u2019s nowhere near as idyllic as people make it out to be, he said.\n\nTimmermeister spoke with Salon about the romanticism, real and imagined, of a life dedicated to growing food, and about why the world needs more of its best and brightest to return to the farm. This interview has been lightly edited and condensed.\n\nWhat inspired the idea for you \u2014 first to serve this extremely local meal for visitors, then to tell its origin story?\n\nI needed a way to pay the bills. I had been to this place in Portland years before, run by Michael Hebb and Naomi Pomeroy \u2014 it has since closed \u2014 that was doing a private dinner club, and I thought it was really intriguing. It sounds kind of funny now, in 2013, but at the time nobody was doing what they were doing, where it was private, you had to be on an email list, you didn\u2019t know what was going to be for dinner, there were no menus and you were going to sit at a community table \u2014 it\u2019s now hysterical that that was unheard of, but it was. A private dining club was this crazy idea, and I was so excited about it.\n\nI wanted to do it here at the farm, and I realized I was making great food, so why didn\u2019t I try and make everything for the dinner from what we grew here? It seems very obvious now, but at the time it seemed kind of like a crazy idea. Once I ended it, I realized that it was something special, and it was something interesting, and that it had become very commonplace to me: of course you grow all your own food, and of course you make extravagant meals. But I realized it wasn\u2019t commonplace to other people, and that it would be a beautiful story to tell people of where food comes from.\n\nThe idea of connecting with your food is something that\u2019s really touching a nerve right now \u2014 what is it about going to the farm and seeing where their food comes from that appeals so strongly to people?\n\nI want to believe that we\u2019ve always wanted that connection, but we weren\u2019t allowed to for so long. Now we\u2019re able to \u2014 you can figure out where the pork comes from. I think we want some story in our life. We want to know about what\u2019s going on around us, we want to be participants in our lives. We don\u2019t want to just eat what\u2019s in front of us \u2014 we want to decide what we\u2019re going to eat, and we want to eat well. We now know what bad food is, so I think we very much want to know what great food is.\n\nDo you find that the people who came to your meals romanticize farm life, and the idea of local food?\n\nYes, [laughs] it\u2019s actually kind of a problem. I did, so that\u2019s the first thing. I\u2019m as guilty as anyone. When I quit my job and first started doing this, I had a very romantic notion of it. It was very, very quickly dispelled. I didn\u2019t have any employees, at the beginning. And I had cows, and there was all this manure and mud, and it was winter. They were dairy cows, which are the hardest, because you can\u2019t quit. There can be a foot of snow out there, and it\u2019s Christmas Eve \u2014 it absolutely doesn\u2019t matter. You still have to go out there and bring the cows into the barn, and milk them and feed them and water them. You just have to. It\u2019s kind of a trial by fire: you can\u2019t say, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t really think this is as cute as I thought it would be.\u201d There\u2019s no way of stopping it.\n\nBut people have a very romanticized notion of it. The dilemma for me is that I perpetuate it, also. I write books that describe the romantic nature of it in many ways, so I\u2019m guilty of keeping that myth going. But I try to push it, always, as well. Especially with meat. When I was doing the dinners for customers, I\u2019d be very clear: \u201cWe\u2019re having beef for dinner: This was a calf named Jesus, it was slaughtered a month ago, then we hung it for 14 days, and now we\u2019re roasting it up and we have this beautiful dinner.\u201d Some people really didn\u2019t like that. And I don\u2019t care.\n\nThat\u2019s definitely the part of the book that\u2019s hardest to read.\n\nI want to be incredibly clear: I think you should enjoy this beef roast, I think it\u2019s really good, and it was an animal a month ago. We killed it just so we can have this lovely dinner. You need to be aware of that. So I won\u2019t gloss over those bits at all. But this farm is very pretty. It always looks very good, and so people can easily fall for that.\n\nThe hardest part is when it comes to my personal life. I will meet people and they\u2019re like, \u201cI love your life and I want it because it\u2019s so fabulous.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cIt\u2019s a life just like yours, except that there\u2019s cows outside of my window and not an office building.\u201d They think that because it\u2019s visually very pretty out here, and the food is very tasty, that therefore I\u2019m happy every day.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Farmer and author Kurt Timmermeister on growing a feast with the help of small-scale farming", "title": "Where that Christmas feast really came from", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Farmer and author Kurt Timmermeister on growing a feast with the help of small-scale farming", "title": "Where that Christmas feast really came from", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/25/where_that_christmas_feast_really_came_from/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/feast1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Farmer and author Kurt Timmermeister on growing a feast with the help of small-scale farming", "title": "Where that Christmas feast really came from", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/feast1.jpg", "creator": "@readingirl", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Agriculture, Editor's Picks, Farmers market, food culture, GMOs", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2760\"", "article_summary": "Do you find that the people who came to your meals romanticize farm life, and the idea of local food?\nIt\u2019s kind of a trial by fire: you can\u2019t say, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t really think this is as cute as I thought it would be.\u201d There\u2019s no way of stopping it.\nBut I realized it wasn\u2019t commonplace to other people, and that it would be a beautiful story to tell people of where food comes from.\nGrowing a Feast, Timmermeister\u2019s second book, tells the story of one such meal, made entirely of ingredients from his farm.\nI want to be incredibly clear: I think you should enjoy this beef roast, I think it\u2019s really good, and it was an animal a month ago."}
