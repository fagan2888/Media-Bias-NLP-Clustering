And for lots of valid reasons \u2013 an economic recovery that hasn\u2019t trickled down, continued Middle East chaos, Ebola panic at home and the botched rollout of his signature healthcare reforms - Mr Obama will only just scrape a pass.\n\nWhichever way the White House looks at the polls, the news is not good. It now looks very likely that Republicans will take back control of the Senate, further enfeebling an already troubled presidency, while Mr Obama\u2019s own approval ratings are stuck permanently at periscope-depth.\n\nThe president\u2019s remaining supporters will contend that much of this slough of despond is not of Mr Obama\u2019s making, and that he is unfairly taking the blame for events and circumstances he cannot be expected to control.\n\nThere is an element of truth to this determinist view: American Presidents often take more credit than they deserve when things go well, and correspondingly accept unfair amounts of blame when they go badly.\n\nAfter all, it\u2019s hardly Mr Obama\u2019s fault that global economic forces mean that GDP growth \u2013 up 8 per cent during his tenure \u2013 has translated into soaring stock markets and corporate profits but not healthier household incomes for the ordinary Joe.\n\nOn the plus side, it should be noted that Mr Obama has also announced some serious environmental reforms in his second term that make it impossible to burn coal in the US without carbon capture. That may not have made international headlines, but lays a legacy that will grow over time.\n\nIt is also true that while the initial rollout of the Obamacare health reforms was spectacularly inept, the exchange websites are now working and \u2013 something which no-one from either party would have predicted a year ago \u2013 Obamacare has hardly even been an issue on the campaign trail this Autumn.\n\nBut despite these admittedly modest achievements, Mr Obama\u2019s numbers are still horrible, his support dwindling even among the Hispanics, women and young people who once idolised him. If Democrats fare as badly as the polls suggest, it will be because these voting blocs could not be bothered to turn out and vote.\n\nAnd therein perhaps lies a clue as to Mr Obama\u2019s real problem \u2013 the man who once seemed capable of moving an entire nation seems to have lost the confidence of an electorate who as recently as 2012 were prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt.\n\nWhat happened? Mr Obama\u2019s supporters will try to blame unforeseen events, second terms blues and Republican intransigence, but the truth is that a large part of the Obama confidence-crisis is of his own making.\n\nIt stems first from several terrible foreign policy decisions \u2013 or non-decisions \u2013 and then secondly from the absolutely baffling failure of Mr Obama, surely one of the most talented US politicians since Franklin Roosevelt, to rectify the situation.\n\nThe foundations for failure were laid in the first term, when Mr Obama apparently eschewed the need for American leadership in the world, but the cracks only began to appear in the second term. They began with the failure to enforce the 'red line\u2019 over chemical weapons use in Syria, followed a year later by the fateful underestimation of the strength of the Islamic State movement \u2013 a \u201cJV\u201d or Junior Varsity team as he called them.\n\nFor a surprisingly long time the polls suggested that a war-weary nation was giving Mr Obama a free-pass on these failings, a silence that to some in the media-obsessed White House provided a cynical argument for the success of the long-standing non-strategy in Syria.\n\nBut that piece of cover was stripped away the instant that the American journalist James Foley was beheaded in front of Isil\u2019s cameras, a moment that suddenly plunged Mr Obama\u2019s weaknesses and failings into the American popular consciousness.\n\nWhat has shocked even more, from a political perspective, is Mr Obama\u2019s response: the goofing around on golf carts, the bungled press conference where he confessed there was 'no strategy\u2019 on Syria, the diffident interviews and then the panicked and stroppy handling of the Ebola outbreak.\n\nAll this explains Mr Obama\u2019s low-standing, but what it does not explain is why this president, of all presidents, has been so abject at the theatrical requirements of an office which, it now appears, he won largely on the basis of theatrics.\n\nThis is the president who filled the Strasse des 17 Juni in Berlin in 2008 and who, time and again during that topsy-turvy campaign, rescued his fortunes through the power of his speech \u2013 think of the great \u201cMore perfect union\u201d speech on race, or his oration at the 2008 Jefferson-Jackson dinner in Iowa.\n\nFor historians to come, this will be the great imponderable of the Obama years: how was it that a leader with such obvious theatrical talents proved unable, or unwilling \u2013 it is not clear \u2013 to summon them when he needed them the most.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "GSACategory": "worldnews", "twitter": {"player": {"width": 560, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/player.swf?keepEmbedCode=true&autoplay=1&embedCode=ZvMWw5cTpv6KMVkbLAzwOu-BN5L8Oj7C&adSetCode=b20883587d124da4a8f29205f8be38ea", "height": 315}, "image": {"src": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03092/barack_3092726k.jpg"}, "site": "@Telegraph", "card": "player", "creator": "@pmdfoster"}, "keywords": "US Politics,World News,News", "DCSext.cmsSect": "News;World_News;USA;Peter_Foster;US_Politics;US_Election", "DCSext.Channel": "news", "DCSext.MLC": "/news/worldnews/us-politics", "DCSext.Content_Type": "Story", "WT.cg_n": "news", "title": "American Way: Why voters will flunk Barack Obama on his midterm report card", "section-id": 6227, "GSAGenre": "uspolitics", "tmgads.pagetype": "Story", "DCSext.akamigeo": "US", "tmgads.section": "news-worldnews-us_politics", "GSAMLC": "news/worldnews/uspolitics", "GSAArticleType": "Story", "article-id": 11202960, "WT.cg_s": "worldnews", "description": "The Republicans are set to control the Senate and the President's approval \n  ratings are at a record low.
