Madison - Rice Lake senior Henry Ellenson will not play in the Division 2 state final Saturday due to a broken left hand.

Ellenson, who is right-handed, told reporters of his status after he was honored during halftime of the Division 5 championship game for being named Mr. Basketball with Dominican senior Diamond Stone.

“It’s disappointing,” Ellenson said. “I haven’t missed a high school game my whole career. Missing this one is really tough, but things happen for a reason.”

Ellenson, who suffered the injury during a state semifinal victory over Greendale Friday, said the initial diagnosis was that he’d miss 6-8 weeks, which would mean he wouldn’t be able to play in the McDonald’s All-American game April 1 in Chicago.

The diagnosis is preliminary, though. Ellenson said he still has to talk to a hand surgeon.
