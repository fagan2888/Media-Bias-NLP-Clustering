Six years ago, Mark\u2019s Liberty and Tyranny: A Conservative Manifesto appeared, quite coincidentally with the lift-off of the Tea Party. In an instant L&T became what then-Congresswoman Michele Bachmann called the party\u2019s \u201cintellectual foundation.\u201d\n\nIn this space I referred to L&T as \u201cthe book that changed America,\u201d writing in part:\n\nLiberty and Tyranny\u2019s red, white, and blue flag-and-flame cover bearing Levin\u2019s bearded visage was waved aloft at Tea Party rallies. Bachmann marvels that \u201cit\u2019s difficult to educate a nation\u201d but says Tea Partiers made a point to \u201ctake copies of the book to town hall meetings\u201d to grill House and Senate members on their knowledge of the Constitution they had taken an oath to obey. The book\u2019s cover itself appeared in poster form. One memorable photo captured former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin at a rally seated next to a soldier, the Levin book clearly visible in her lap. While the Palin photo was both real and un-staged, there was the inevitable humorous photo shopping. North Korea\u2019s Communist dictator Kim Jong Il \u2014 aka \u201cThe Great Leader\u201d \u2014 was pictured brandishing a copy of the book written by the man his friends and fans call \u201cThe Great One.\u201d Another Liberty and Tyranny fan went to work mocking Obama\u2019s famous 2008 campaign poster, replacing Obama\u2019s image with an iconic rendering of Levin, the caption changed from \u201cHope and Change\u201d to read simply: \u201cThe Great One.\u201d\n\nNow comes Plunder and Deceit: Big Government\u2019s Exploitation of Young People and the Future. A frightening look into exactly what today\u2019s thoughtless and greedy ruling generation of Americans are leaving behind for the next generation \u2014 their own children.\n\nAgain by the purest of coincidence the book appears as the wave of support for Donald Trump hits the political shores, with one poll after another showing Americans rallying to the candidate who speaks in blunt terms about the incompetence of Washington politicians and their endless spendthrift ways that are mindlessly turning America into Greece, spending and regulating the \u201clast best hope\u201d of man on earth into oblivion. As Trump noted the other day, quite separate from Trump himself this furious resistance to elites in both parties and the media has become a movement unto itself. Meanwhile, on the floor of the U.S. Senate, Americans are seeing the startling sight of another GOP presidential candidate, Texas Senator Ted Cruz, directly taking on the Senate GOP Leadership, with Cruz accusing McConnell of explicitly lying to him in an effort to preserve support for the cronyism that is the Export-Import Bank.\n\nPlunder and Deceit is the literary version of what is driving this movement, with Mark noting this telling thought from Charles de Montesquieu, the French philosopher whose thinking was so \u201cinfluential on the Constitution\u2019s Framers\u201d:\n\nWhen that virtue ceases, ambition enters those hearts that can admit it, and avarice enters them all\u2026. Formerly the goods of individuals made up the public treasury, the public treasury has now become the patrimony of individuals. The republic is a cast-off husk, and its strength is no more than the power of a few citizens and the license of all.\n\nThe public treasury as \u201cthe patrimony of individuals\u201d with a \u201cfew citizens\u201d \u2014 aka Washington special interests \u2014 having \u201cthe license of all\u201d is exactly illustrated by the current controversy over those Planned Parenthood videos that have horrified Americans with the revelation of crushing baby heads to sell various body parts. Well aside from the appalling immorality \u2014 other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play? \u2014 the stunning news that Planned Parenthood receives $500 million a year from the public treasury is a pluperfect illustration of Mark\u2019s point that today\u2019s ruling generation is setting up the next \u2014 and the next after that on down the line \u2014 for a devastating future of \u201ceconomic and societal calamity.\u201d Writes Mark:\n\nThe consequences for the rising generation and future generations of the statists\u2019 immoral, politically expedient, and economically ruinous behavior and policies are unambiguous as evidenced by statistic after statistic, which are mainly ignored, discounted, or excused by most of the media, academia, and, of course, government statists. Nonetheless, there is no mistaking the eventual societal turmoil these facts and figures portend \u2014 evidence all Americans, and especially younger people, must heed.\n\nExhibit A in this is, of course, the debt, simultaneously the result of both plunder and deceit. Mark addresses it head on:\n\nThe nation\u2019s fiscal operating debt was already $10.6 trillion on the day President Barack Obama took office in January 2009. By the end of January 2012, however, the fiscal operating debt had increased 44.5 percent to $15.4 million. As of April 12, 2015, the fiscal operating debt was $18.152trillion \u2014 a 71 percent increase in less than six and one half years. Each man, woman, and child in this country\u2019s share of the national debt has grown from $33,220 at the beginning of the Obama presidency to more than $56,900 today. To be sure, the debt habit began long before the Obama presidency, but it is now a full-blown addiction.\n\nSo it is. And it isn\u2019t the only addiction, either. Working his way through Social Security (\u201cit will stop with a crash\u201d), Medicare, and Obamacare (federal control of health care \u201canother impending fiasco\u201d), immigration (\u201cassimilation no longer means Americanization\u201d), education (\u201ctoo often driven by statist ideology and objectives, academic fads and social experimentation\u201d), the environment (a war on capitalism conducted by extremists \u201cwhose real ideology and agenda extend far beyond clean air and water\u201d), the minimum wage (\u201c a job killer\u201d), and more, Mark patiently connects each to the fate of the \u201crising generation\u201d that is America\u2019s future.\n\nSuffice to say, as the title of the book illustrates, none of this is good news for those who will someday themselves become \u201cthe ruling generation.\u201d\n\nNo Levin book would be complete without a discussion of the Constitution, and Plunder and Deceit does not disappoint. He writes:\n\nWhy should the United States Constitution, and the faithful adherence to and execution of it by public officials, matter to younger people? It provides the governing order of a republic intended to protect the individual\u2019s liberty from a tyrannical centralized authority and, conversely, the anarchy of mob rule.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan once pointedly noted:\n\nFreedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn\u2019t pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children\u2019s children what it was once like in the United States where men were free.\n\nExactly. And alas the current \u201cruling generation\u201d \u2014 those who \u201cnaturally and tenaciously guard their young children from threat and peril\u201d \u2014 are in fact setting up those very children, the next ruling generation of America, for a serious fall.\n\nMark makes a point towards the end of the book of calling for what he calls a \u201cNew Civil Rights Movement.\u201d Which he describes as:\n\n\u2026 not of the sort that exists today, which has been co-opted by statists, is often led by hucksters, and serves as a surrogate and advocate for centralized government and its pervasive agenda. But a truly new civil rights movement organized around fostering liberty and prosperity for younger people and future generations and against their continued exploitation. Indeed, the well-being of America\u2019s younger people through the restoration and then preservation of the nation\u2019s founding principles should be the primary objective of public policy debates.\n\nYes \u2014 but as Mark also notes, this is easier said than done.\n\nMy own favorite in challenging the statist status quo is in The Liberty Amendments, the last Levin book, which focused on the Constitution\u2019s Article V Convention of the States process. In Plunder and Deceit he notes of it this way, saying that the Article V process \u201cempowers the American people, through their state legislatures, to civilly and lawfully reform an oppressive federal government.\u201d\n\nThis reverberates every time the now-Republican led Congress refuses to seriously challenge the status quo or worse, as Senator Cruz made crystal clear over the weekend, lies about doing so. The latter that only results in further inflaming an already furious conservative base of the Republican Party. It reverberates every time the Supreme Court decides to remove a major social issue from the decision-making abilities of the American public. It reverberates every time Congress concedes some of its power to un-elected regulation-making bureaucracies.\n\nThe combination of all of this \u201cPlunder and Deceit\u201d is a toxic if not potentially lethal combination for the next generation of Americans \u2014 and the next and the next.\n\nThe question Mark poses at the end of this book should give the next generation pause.\n\nSo, I ask the rising generation \u2014 America\u2019s younger people \u2014 what do you choose for yourself and future generations? Do you choose liberty or tyranny? And what do you intend to do about it?\n\nAs always when reading Mark Levin \u2014 good question. One can only hope that for their sake the members of the rising generation have an answer.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Uncanny: Mark Levin has done it again.\nAs always when reading Mark Levin \u2014 good question.\nOne memorable photo captured former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin at a rally seated next to a soldier, the Levin book clearly visible in her lap.\nExhibit A in this is, of course, the debt, simultaneously the result of both plunder and deceit.\nThe combination of all of this \u201cPlunder and Deceit\u201d is a toxic if not potentially lethal combination for the next generation of Americans \u2014 and the next and the next."}
