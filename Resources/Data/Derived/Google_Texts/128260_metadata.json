Nicknamed \u201cHolly Hobby Lobby\u201d for her support for the the Supreme Court\u2019s controversial decision last week, Fisher is now the face of a Twitter meme many are calling the \u201cAmerican Taliban.\u201d\n\nThe image making the rounds on Twitter shows Fisher standing in front of the American flag holding a gun and a copy of the Holy Bible. (Fisher herself posted the photo.)\n\nBiggest complaint I'm getting about my #HobbyLobby pic is there's no gun, bible, or flag. Tried to make up for it pic.twitter.com/YneQ9Dkkxi \u2014 Holly Hobby Lobby (@HollyRFisher) July 4, 2014\n\nIn the meme, that photo is side-by-side with an image of Sherafiyah Lewthwaite, an international terrorist known as the White Widow who is part of the Al-Shabaab Islamic militant group. The meme, which shows Lewthwaite in a similar stance while holding a gun and a copy of the Quran, says: \u201cExplain the difference.\u201d\n\nDifference? I can kill you without having to kill myself...in a bikini...while eating bacon...and having a margarita. pic.twitter.com/Ru84BOU3kF \u2014 Holly Hobby Lobby (@HollyRFisher) July 6, 2014\n\n\u201cMy new nickname is \"American Taliban\" it seems. You know how I know the lefties don't really think I'm a terrorist? They hate me,\u201d Fisher wrote on Monday in response to the backlash.\n\nIn other tweets, Fisher wrote to her 34,000+ followers: \u201cJihad Barbie. That means they think I'm pretty, right?\u201d and, \u201cI'm not a terrorist, but my husband has killed a few. #ftw.\u201d\n\nPundits like Michael Stone, an atheist blogger for faith-site Patheos, called Fisher \u201cthe new face of American Taliban.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps the only thing more dangerous and destructive than religious extremism is violent religious extremism cloaked in the mask of pseudo patriotism,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhile Holly Hobby Lobby is just a social media clown out for attention, she represents a dangerous strand of Christian fundamentalism that enjoys flirting with, if not threatening, real violence.\u201d\n\nOther commentators, like Charles C. W. Cooke of The National Review, say Fisher is just expressing her views, as is her right.\n\n\u201cThe woman on the left is a peaceful American citizen with a husband in the military. She has never killed anybody, and nor does she have any desire to,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe reason that you know her name is that she has become a minor political celebrity for her outspoken support of a Supreme Court decision that upheld the rule of law against the intrusion of the executive branch.\u201d\n\nThe Charleston, West Virginia, resident seems to enjoy goading her critics. After the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling to allow for-profit companies to deny birth control on religious grounds, Fisher posed smiling in front of a Hobby Lobby store, wearing a pro-life T-shirt and holding a Chick-fil-A cup.\n\nATTENTION LIBERALS: do NOT look at this picture. Your head will most likely explode. #HobbyLobby #UniteBlue pic.twitter.com/uAIZji25vS \u2014 Holly Hobby Lobby (@HollyRFisher) July 1, 2014\n\nOn the receiving end of personal attacks, she retorted: \u201cIsn't it funny that the people who call me fat, ugly, a whore, stupid ... a bitch, etc. are the same ones whining about the #WarOnWomen?\u201d\n\nThe Inquisitr reported Fisher began to receive death threats as well as comments like \u201cgive this b---h an unwanted pregnancy.\u201d\n\nThis is not Fisher\u2019s first time in the spotlight. In June, the mother of three and wife of an Army combat-infantry vet vented on Twitter about losing her baby\u2019s cardiologist, blaming Obamacare for her loss.\n\n\u201cJust got a call saying my 10m/o(born w/2 heart conditions)is covered under NO ped. cardiologists due to our new shit plan. Thx, #Obamacare!\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cHey @BarackObama, thanks to you I got my new insurance plan & it takes away all of my baby's heart doctors. Should I wait for your check?\u201d she tweeted to the president.\n\nA third tweet with a photo of her daughter read: \u201cThanks, @BarackObama, for causing her to lose her cardiologist. Her name is Norah, not that you care.\u201d\n\nMany of her tweets have since been deleted. Still, she was attacked by Twitter users.\n\n\u201c@HollyRFisher @BarackObama not his fault. U should get a job and pay for it yourself instead of taking selfies all day. I feel bad for u tbh\u2014 Skyler White,\u201d one tweet from Twitter user @TweetsSkyler read.\n\nFisher told Western Journalism that she\u2019s not bothered by all of the attention, though many close to her are troubled by her recent fame.\n\n\u201cMy friends are shocked. I\u2019ve got a lot of texts asking if I\u2019m OK and people in disbelief about the things people say and how well I take it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t bother me that some coward is hiding behind their keyboard thinking of rude things to say to some stranger.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "holly fisher, holly hobby lobby, woman holding gun, american taliban, holly fisher american taliban, holly fisher hobby lobby, holly fisher twitter, holly hobby lobby twitter, who is the american taliban, who is holly hobby lobby, who is holly fisher", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "Holly Fisher, aka \"Holly Hobby Lobby,\" a Christian mother from West Virginia, is the subject of a meme calling her the \"American Taliban.\"", "title": "Who Is Holly Fisher? \u2018Holly Hobby Lobby\u2019 Now An Internet Meme Called The \u2018American Taliban\u2019", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/who-holly-fisher-holly-hobby-lobby-now-internet-meme-called-american-taliban-1621310", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2014/07/07/who-holly-fisher-holly-hobby-lobby.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Holly Fisher, aka \"Holly Hobby Lobby,\" a Christian mother from West Virginia, is the subject of a meme calling her the \"American Taliban.\"", "title": "Who Is Holly Fisher? \u2018Holly Hobby Lobby\u2019 Now An Internet Meme Called The \u2018American Taliban\u2019", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/who-holly-fisher-holly-hobby-lobby-now-internet-meme-called-american-taliban-1621310", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2014/07/07/who-holly-fisher-holly-hobby-lobby.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2014/07/07/who-holly-fisher-holly-hobby-lobby.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "Media & Culture", "published_time": "2014-07-07T19:53:30-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-07T20:05:47-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Holly Fisher, aka \"Holly Hobby Lobby,\" a Christian mother from West Virginia, is the subject of a meme calling her the \"American Taliban.\""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdae80\"", "article_summary": "pic.twitter.com/Ru84BOU3kF \u2014 Holly Hobby Lobby (@HollyRFisher) July 6, 2014\u201cMy new nickname is \"American Taliban\" it seems.\nHolly Fisher is a newly minted Internet celebrity famous for speaking out about her political beliefs about guns, abortion, health care and other hot button political issues.\nThey hate me,\u201d Fisher wrote on Monday in response to the backlash.\n#HobbyLobby #UniteBlue pic.twitter.com/uAIZji25vS \u2014 Holly Hobby Lobby (@HollyRFisher) July 1, 2014On the receiving end of personal attacks, she retorted: \u201cIsn't it funny that the people who call me fat, ugly, a whore, stupid ... a bitch, etc.\nIn other tweets, Fisher wrote to her 34,000+ followers: \u201cJihad Barbie."}
