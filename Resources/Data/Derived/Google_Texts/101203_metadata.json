(photo credit: Zoe Kaiser)\n\n\n\nWhen Amber Cavarlez was in high school and her mother died of colon cancer, she and her Filipino Catholic family went to church and lit candles every day. But, she says, \u201cAfter she passed, nothing was said about it. No one talked about it.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn her home, she says, sadness was an \u201cinvisible subject.\u201d And when she cried at school and sought help, she received an anonymous message through Facebook that said, \u201cDon\u2019t cry at school because no one cares.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe learned to keep her feelings to herself, but her family\u2019s struggles weren\u2019t over \u2013 her brother was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and attempted suicide several times in the following years. By then attending college in San Francisco, she often found herself emotionally unable to go to class, and was told by the administration that she\u2019d have to improve academically or drop out.\n\n\n\nShe sought the help of a therapist on campus and eventually graduated. Now 23, she is a mentor with the Peer Wellness Program at Edgewood Center for Children and Families in San Francisco. Though doing well herself, she wishes her brother had had someone to talk to when he was in school. Young people \u201cneed someone there to ask about [their feelings], to make it valid,\u201d she says.\n\n\n\nCavarlez spoke with other young people at a media forum organized by New America Media in San Francisco last week on challenging stigmas around youth depression. Alongside the youth storytellers, a panel of experts in the mental health field weighed in on the views of depression across different cultures and a fractured system for delivering mental health services. They agreed that youth depression is more widespread than many people realize, and that it thrives on silence.\n\n\n\nBut both advocates and practitioners were above all optimistic about the future of mental health in children and youth, and expressed a growing excitement over treatment options \u2013 in the words of Patrick Gardner, founder of the Young Minds Advocacy Project, \u201cWe have a moment of opportunity to change some things.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe public is engaged in a way that I have never seen before around children\u2019s mental health,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nA fractured system, but new opportunities for treatment\n\n\n\nGardner says that access to mental health coverage has increased dramatically because of the Affordable Care Act, and that \u201cwe can expect these resources to continue to grow.\u201d But, he says, \u201cWe aren\u2019t especially effective at systems in delivering services to children.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe points to long waiting lists for services \u2013 \u201cBecause we delay access to the system, [people] drop out,\u201d he says \u2013 as well as the need to improve the quality of care.\n\n\n\nAnd the need is high, especially in California. Gardner says that mental health problems account for 85 percent of the disease burden for people between the ages of 15 and 25.\n\n\n\nDr. Regan Foust, the data manager at the Lucile Packard Foundation for Children\u2019s Health, agrees. In 2012, she said, mental diseases and disorders accounted for the largest share of hospital admissions among children under 18 in California \u2013 some 12 percent of all hospitalizations. Statistics from kidsdata.org (the program that Foust manages) show that mental health problems are the most common primary diagnosis for a hospital stay for kids under 18, more common than bronchitis or fevers.\n\n\n\nDepression in the very young\n\n\n\nDr. Manpreet K. Singh, an assistant professor at Stanford School of Medicine who works in the university\u2019s Pediatric Mood Disorders Program, stressed the importance of parents and educators being able to recognize early warning signs. \u201cThese signs can be evident even as early as infancy and early childhood, especially if the child has been exposed to family stress, chaos, conflict, or trauma,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nYoung children who are depressed, she says, might withdraw from activities that are normally fun for them, easily anger or become irritable, have difficulty with relationships, or be extremely sensitive to rejection or failure as compared to other kids. They also might decline academically, have headaches or stomachaches that don\u2019t respond to treatment, or change their eating or sleeping patterns. She cautions that depression tends to run in families and can transmit from parent to child.\n\n\n\nLike Gardner, Singh is optimistic about the future of treatment. \u201cWe now know for a fact that [depression] is treatable in children,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nA 19-year-old woman who spoke on the panel was one such person who was depressed from a young age. Lena\u2019s parents are immigrants from China. Her biological father had another family in China; he brought them to the United States when she was 6 years old and kicked Lena and her mother out of the house.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo one would acknowledge me as family. That was very hard for me to deal with,\u201d she said. \u201cI really had nobody growing up \u2026 I asked, \u2018Why didn\u2019t I have a father? Why was everybody else so lucky?\u2019 I realized I didn\u2019t like doing things anymore. I had no interest in things.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe went to a teacher when she was in 6th grade and asked to talk to a therapist. \u201cI would cry through the entire session,\u201d she said. She would often think about \u201cWhat [she] was taught, how [she\u2019s] not supposed to share anything.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe stigma across cultures\n\n\n\nKatherine Kam, a journalist who has reported on depression and suicide in Asian American adolescents, added that \u201cAmong parents, especially in traditional immigrant households, there\u2019s not a lot of understanding about mental illness and about depression \u2026 Parents often rejected the diagnosis because they felt that it was a very embarrassing diagnosis. It brought shame to their families.\u201d\n\n\n\nCounselors who work with Asian American families told her that depression is often seen as a personal weakness or a moral failing in Asian cultures, and that if a person works hard enough he or she can overcome it.\n\n\n\nJene\u00e9 Darden, the host of Mental Health and Wellness Radio at P.E.E.R.S. in Oakland (Peers Envisioning and Engaging in Recovery Services), spoke of a similar experience having depression in the African American community.\n\n\n\nShe would sometimes hear from family and friends, \u201cBlack women are supposed to be strong, or depression is a white thing, that going to a therapist is a white thing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI would hear, \u2018You\u2019re not praying hard enough,\u2019\u201d she added. \u201cOur first step to getting help is the pastor, is the church \u2026 [I would hear] \u2018Don\u2019t take your problems to the therapist, take them to Jesus.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nDifferent ways of finding help\n\n\n\nA 20-year-old Indian American woman going by \u201cLeela\u201d (she didn\u2019t want her parents to know that she had spoken publicly about her experiences) recalled having been depressed for most of her life. Her depression worsened, though, after she was sexually assaulted in college.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy tendency is to become immobile, and I barricaded myself inside my dorm room for the rest of the year,\u201d she said. \u201cI did not leave. I told my parents that I was going to school but I was not.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen I tell my parents, I sort of feel like I have to justify the way I\u2019m feeling,\u201d she said. \u201c[I say] \u2018I\u2019m not doing well in school because I\u2019m scared.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m not doing well in school because some days I cannot leave the house.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nShe says that what helped her was finding other people who feel the way she does.\n\n\n\nRobert Cervantez, 19, said that talking about his depression doesn\u2019t help. For him, it\u2019s being a musician that helps him cope \u2013 it gives him \u201can outlet to express [his] depression and [his] anger.\u201d\n\n\n\nSonya Mann, also 19, called herself \u201cgenetically unlucky\u201d coming from a family with a strong history of mental illness. She feels lucky to have had professional medical support while she was growing up, but she continues to feel shame over her depression: \u201cEven though I\u2019ve been told so many times that it\u2019s not my fault, that\u2019s it\u2019s not a personal weakness \u2026 I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s not my fault.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe\u2019s had to come to terms with the fact that she will likely have to manage her depression all her life. She agrees that it\u2019s treatable, she says, but \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s curable. It\u2019s something you have that you learn how to deal with.\u201d\n\n\n\nNew ways of thinking, and looking to the future\n\n\n\nRob Gitin, the co-founder and executive director of At The Crossroads, which reaches out to homeless youth, said that current trends around the way services are delivered need to change.\n\n\n\n\u201cServices are becoming more conditional, more outcome-focused, shorter-termed and more disciplined,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nWhen kids act out in ways that are consistent with symptoms of youth depression, such as skipping school and getting into fights, \u201cThese are things that will get you kicked out programs,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not doing what you\u2019re told to, you\u2019re being violent, you\u2019re not engaging with services.\u201d In their search for evidence-based results, programs end up shutting out the kids who need help the most, because those kids don\u2019t live up to strict expectations.\n\n\n\nAnd, he says, the outlook of many service providers needs to change.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think that a lot of the time the people doing the work make a mistake. They think that it is your job to make people feel better. It\u2019s not your job to make people feel better, it\u2019s your job to make people feel okay about however they\u2019re feeling,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you try to do that all you\u2019re going to do is force them to deny their feelings and suppress whatever they\u2019re going through.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is no model on how you help people,\u201d he adds. \u201cHow you help people is you listen to them, you get to know them as an individual. You learn what\u2019s great about them and what\u2019s awful about them, and you help them accept whoever they are and help them figure out who they want to be.\u201d\n\n\n\nZiomara Ochoa, LMFT, is the supervisor of the South County Youth Team at Behavioral Health and Recovery Services in San Mateo. She primarily provides services to a Latino population, many of whom are immigrants or undocumented. Her work, she says, is moving from a focus on treatment into the realm of prevention, with programs like Mental Health First Aid, a public education program that educates participants about risk factors and warning signs of mental health problems and teaches them how to help a person in crisis.\n\n\n\nThe hope is that by educating the community through platforms like forums and group discussions, depression and mental illness in young people can be prevented through community awareness.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s part a movement, she says, to \u201cintegrate community-based practices that really work with our community and really validate [them] just as much as evidence-based practices.\u201d\n\n\n\nKordnie Lee, a Youth Mental Health First Aid instructor with Lincoln Child Center in Alameda County, added \u201cIt\u2019s really about giving a common language \u2026 if a young person is doing something that you don\u2019t understand or exhibiting symptoms that you don\u2019t understand, that you [don\u2019t] just send them to someone else and that person\u2019s going to figure it out. It is a community, it is a holistic responsibility that all of us have.\u201d\n\n\n\nVisit newamericamedia.org/feelbetter to hear stories from other young people.
