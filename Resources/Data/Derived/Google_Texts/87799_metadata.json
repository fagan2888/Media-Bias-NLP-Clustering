LOUIS (AP) - Thousands gathered Saturday for a second day of organized rallies and marches protesting Michael Brown\u2019s death and other fatal police shootings in the St. Louis area and nationwide.\n\nThe events remained peaceful but boisterous gatherings into the night. Vietnam-era peace activists, New York City seminarians and hundreds of fast-food workers bused in from Chicago, Nashville and other cities marched alongside local residents, spurred by a national campaign dubbed Ferguson October.\n\nOutside Busch Stadium in downtown St. Louis, where the Cardinals hosted the San Francisco Giants in the first game of the National League Championship Series, several dozen protesters stood on the sidewalk, chanting and holding signs. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that fans headed to the game mainly went around the protesters without stopping to look, though a few cheered their efforts.\n\nFour days of planned events began Friday afternoon with a march outside the St. Louis County prosecutor\u2019s office. Protesters renewed calls for prosecutor Bob McCulloch to charge Darren Wilson, a white Ferguson officer, in the Aug. 9 death of Brown, a black, unarmed 18-year-old. A grand jury is reviewing the case and the Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation.\n\n\u201cWe still are knee deep in this situation,\u201d said Kareem Jackson, a St. Louis rap artist and community organizer whose stage name is Tef Poe. \u201cWe have not packed up our bags, we have not gone home. This is not a fly-by-night moment. This is not a made-for-TV revolution. This is real people standing up to a real problem and saying, \u2018We ain\u2019t taking it no more.\u2019\u201d\n\nOn Saturday evening, a smaller group of demonstrators joined Brown\u2019s mother at a prayer vigil and protest outside the Ferguson apartment complex where her son was shot and killed two months ago. The group then marched to the Ferguson police department.\n\nSt. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson, who spoke to small groups of demonstrators throughout the day, said the city had enlisted extra officers and was prepared for trouble, though he hoped for the best. Earlier in the week, a small group of protesters verbally clashed outside the stadium with Cardinals fans who support the Ferguson officer.\n\n\u201cWhat I ask is if people come to have their message heard, that they do it in a respectful way,\u201d Dotson said. \u201cAnd the same thing on the other side (from police supporters). Everybody has a right to have their message heard, whether you like it or not.\u201d\n\nHe said the city also will bolster its police presence when the St. Louis Rams host the San Francisco 49ers Monday night - the same day protesters are planning acts of civil disobedience they expect will lead to widespread arrests.\n\nThe crowd early Saturday was significantly larger than the ones seen at Friday\u2019s protests. While the main focus of the march was on recent police shootings, participants also embraced such causes as gay rights and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Police reported no arrests or violence Saturday afternoon and early evening.\n\n\u201cI have two sons and a daughter. I want a world for them where the people who are supposed to be community helpers are actually helping, where they can trust those people to protect and serve rather than control and repress,\u201d said Ashlee Wiest-Laird, 48, a Baptist pastor from Boston.\n\nThe situation in Missouri resonated with Wiest-Laird. She\u2019s white and her adopted sons, ages 14 and 11, are black.\n\n\u201cWhat I see happening here is a moment in time. There\u2019s something bigger here,\u201d she said.\n\nOrganizers said beforehand that they expected as many as 6,000 to 10,000 participants for the weekend\u2019s events. Police were not able to provide a crowd estimate Saturday, but organizers and participants suggested the march\u2019s size may have approached 3,000.\n\nSince Brown\u2019s death, three other fatal police shootings of black males have occurred in the St. Louis area. The most recent involved an off-duty St. Louis officer who was working for a private neighborhood security patrol when he shot and killed 18-year-old Vonderrit D. Myers on Wednesday night.\n\nThe white officer, whose name hasn\u2019t been released, fired 17 rounds after police say Myers opened fire. Myers\u2019 parents say he was unarmed, and many speakers at a Saturday rally echoed those doubts.\n\n___\n\nFollow Alan Scher Zagier on Twitter at http://twitter.com/azagier", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thousands gathered Saturday for a second day of organized rallies and marches protesting Michael Brown's death and other fatal police shootings in the St. Louis area and nationwide.", "Author": "ALAN SCHER ZAGIER", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Thousands gathered Saturday for a second day of organized rallies and marches protesting Michael Brown\u2019s death and other fatal police shootings in the St. Louis area and nationwide.", "title": "Thousands protest police shootings in St. Louis", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/11/police-shooting-protests-expand-across-st-louis/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/11/26755c2ffed12c27620f6a706700bb9d.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/11/26755c2ffed12c27620f6a706700bb9d.jpg", "title": "Thousands protest police shootings in St. Louis", "description": "Thousands gathered Saturday for a second day of organized rallies and marches protesting Michael Brown's death and other fatal police shootings in the St. Louis area and nationwide.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, St Louis, Ferguson, Michael Brown"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdef50\"", "article_summary": "ST.
