Soaring tax revenue enabled him to boost spending on popular programs well beyond the rate of inflation, while he also prudently put funds aside for rainier days that are sure to come.\n\nMeanwhile, as this page has warned for a year, radical changes in the health care industry were steadily driving the 11 municipal hospitals toward bankruptcy. The forces at work included Obamacare, which enabled newly insured patients to seek treatment in New York\u2019s top-of-the-line medical institutions.\n\nOffered little assistance from City Hall, Dr. Ram Raju, president of Health+Hospitals, the rebranded Health and Hospitals Corp., set out on a futile mission to compete with the big players and to enroll patients in his own health insurance plan. No surprise, that went nowhere.\n\nSo, at last, at a budget presentation de Blasio addressed the inevitability of a major restructuring. This was a major step forward for a politician who had ridden into office promising to save Brooklyn\u2019s Long Island College Hospital from closure \u2014 only to be defeated by the many of the same factors that are sapping Health+Hospitals.\n\nHe said he will be looking for help from Washington and Albany, which is dreamily far from a sure thing.\n\nOn the operating table (James Keivom/New York Daily News)\n\nDE BLASIO'S $82B BUDGET TO ADD GRAB BAG OF NEW INITIATIVES\n\nHe will try to leverage real estate owned by Health+Hospitals for money, waters Raju has already begun testing and which the mayor conceded will not generate much.\n\nAnd then what? De Blasio was most specific about what he will not do.\n\nThe mayor said that he would not close a building, which is very different from vowing not to close a hospital.\n\nThe sure translation is that some big brick structures containing emergency rooms, operating theaters and floor upon floor of vacant patient rooms will be repurposed for other health-related uses. Bye-bye, hospital.\n\nThe mayor also said that he would not lay off hospital workers but would instead rely on attrition and retraining to shrink the workforce. He dared not venture a guess as to how many jobs will inescapably be lost.\n\nFor the moment, de Blasio has fallen back on dispatching a \u201cblue-ribbon\u201d group to complete a \u201croad map.\u201d Better deliver something bold, right quick, because remaking \u2014 no doubt shrinking \u2014 the country\u2019s largest public hospital system so that it fulfills its mission while regaining financial viability will surely be one of the most serious challenges de Blasio is called on to meet as mayor.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Editorials", "twitter": {"description": "The long-in-coming financial collapse of New York City\u2019s public hospitals has finally become critical enough to force...", "title": "Hospitals under the knife", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/hospitals-knife-article-1.2615481", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2615480.1461710248!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/mayor-de-blasio-holds-news-conference-legionnaires-outbreak.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "de blasio budget, new york hospitals, de blasio hospitals, ny hospital funding,", "parsely-author": "Editorials", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "de blasio budget, new york hospitals, de blasio hospitals, ny hospital funding,", "nydn_tags": "bill de blasio, nyc budget", "news_keywords": "de blasio budget, new york hospitals, de blasio hospitals, ny hospital funding,", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/hospitals-knife-article-1.2615481", "parsely-title": "Hospitals under the knife", "sailthru.date": "2016-04-27T04:10:00-0400", "sailthru.title": "Hospitals under the knife", "nydn_section": "Opinion", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-04-27T08:10:00", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2615480.1461710248!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/mayor-de-blasio-holds-news-conference-legionnaires-outbreak.jpg", "description": "The long-in-coming financial collapse of New York City\u2019s public hospitals has finally become critical enough to force...", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "The long-in-coming financial collapse of New York City\u2019s public hospitals has finally become critical enough to force...", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-section": "Opinion", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "The long-in-coming financial collapse of New York City\u2019s public hospitals has finally become critical enough to force...", "title": "Hospitals under the knife", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/hospitals-knife-article-1.2615481", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2615480.1461710248!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/mayor-de-blasio-holds-news-conference-legionnaires-outbreak.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "bill de blasio, nyc budget", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2615480.1461710248!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/mayor-de-blasio-holds-news-conference-legionnaires-outbreak.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Editorials", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS"}, "article_summary": "The long-in-coming financial collapse of New York City\u2019s public hospitals has finally become critical enough to force Mayor de Blasio to do .\nMeanwhile, as this page has warned for a year, radical changes in the health care industry were steadily driving the 11 municipal hospitals toward bankruptcy.\nDE BLASIO PROPOSES $82.2B BUDGET, WARNS OF FINANCIAL THREATSTo this point in his tenure, budgeting has been a relative breeze for de Blasio.\nThe forces at work included Obamacare, which enabled newly insured patients to seek treatment in New York\u2019s top-of-the-line medical institutions.\nOffered little assistance from City Hall, Dr. Ram Raju, president of Health+Hospitals, the rebranded Health and Hospitals Corp., set out on a futile mission to compete with the big players and to enroll patients in his own health insurance plan."}
