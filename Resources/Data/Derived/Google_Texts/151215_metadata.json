I think (Cal) was kind of a wake-up call, when you\u2019re shooting jump shots and there\u2019s going to be nights when the ball isn\u2019t going in. \u2026 Those nights especially, you have to be ready to come out and defend and rebound.\u201d\n\nScott scored 14 points and pulled down 14 rebounds to lead the way for the Buffs (12-3, 1-1 Pac-12).\n\nThe Buffs led 37-27 at halftime and extended their lead to 16 points early in the second half before the Cardinal (8-5, 1-1) stormed back, reeling off a 12-4 run that brought Stanford within eight points with about 10 minutes remaining.\n\nStanford battled to within seven points on a 3-pointer by Marcus Sheffield with 7:30 remaining, a shot that spurred another 7-0 run by the Cardinal. Stanford eventually whittled CU\u2019s lead to just one point in the final minute and a half, with a pair of free throws from Sheffield with 37.3 seconds left again pulling the hosts within a point and setting up a wild finish.\n\nAfter a wayward, desperation 3-pointer at the shot-clock buzzer by Scott, CU was fortunate on a long rebound that a Stanford player touched with his foot on the sideline, giving Buffs the possession with six seconds left. CU committed a turnover on the inbounds play, but Stanford\u2019s desperation heave from inside half-court at the buzzer went awry.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t pretty in the second half,\u201d CU coach Tad Boyle said. \u201cEarly in the season, learning how to win on the road in the league \u2026 it was a tale of two halves. We were great offensively in the first half. We were atrocious on offense in the second half.\u201d\n\nForward Wes Gordon finished with nine rebounds as the Buffs outrebounded Stanford 43-29.\n\nMeanwhile, despite earlier indications the status of injured forward Xavier Johnson would be clarified this week, the senior will remain in limbo until CU returns to Boulder. Boyle said he did not have time to meet with Johnson over the weekend regarding his pending decision on whether he will attempt a comeback from a torn Achilles tendon or take a medical redshirt.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CU Buffs men\u2019s basketball team hangs on vs. Stanford for first Pac-12 win", "title": "CU Buffs men\u2019s basketball team hangs on vs. Stanford for first Pac-12 win", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/03/cu-buffs-mens-basketball-team-hangs-on-vs-stanford-for-first-pac-12-win/", "image": {"width": 436, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160103__BN20160104_Z00_BNSP04BKCCUp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160103__BN20160104_Z00_BNSP04BKCCUp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-03T23:12:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T21:52:35+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t pretty in the second half,\u201d CU coach Tad Boyle said.\nSTANFORD, Calif. \u2014 Colorado made amends Sunday night for a poor performance two days earlier, edging Stanford 56-55 at Maples Pavilion.\nWe were atrocious on offense in the second half.\u201dForward Wes Gordon finished with nine rebounds as the Buffs outrebounded Stanford 43-29.\nCU committed a turnover on the inbounds play, but Stanford\u2019s desperation heave from inside half-court at the buzzer went awry.\n\u201cIt was all about defense, which is something we didn\u2019t do against Cal,\u201d senior center Josh Scott said."}
