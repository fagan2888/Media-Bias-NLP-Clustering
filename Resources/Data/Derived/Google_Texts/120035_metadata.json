Add a language barrier, and it becomes even more difficult. That\u2019s where ConsejoSano is looking to bridge the gap with a new app.\n\nThe California-based medical service provider has created a mobile application that allows Spanish-speaking residents of the United States, both documented and undocumented, to have 24-hour access to physicians that assist with non-life-threatening issues.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make sure our services were high quality, affordable, convenient, and confidential,\u201d says Abner Mason, chief executive officer and founder of ConsejoSano, in a news conference at the National Press Club in Washington on Tuesday.\n\nRecommended: Border crisis 101: eight things to know about unaccompanied children\n\nMr. Mason added that monthly subscribers would pay $9.99 for an individual and $14.99 for a family of up to five members. \u201cThis is as close to universal healthcare that you can get with the help of technology,\u201d he says.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works. Once the application is downloaded, subscribers are able to create a profile with a physician. The physician can then help the virtual patient with either a proper diagnosis or a referral for further review. All physicians are fluent in Spanish.\n\nAccording to the 2012 Census, one out of every four Latinos is uninsured. This is in comparison to one in ten whites and about one in six blacks being uninsured. Given those numbers and the enormous amount spend on healthcare in the US, Mason says there is a clear need for this type of innovation.\n\n\u201cWe needed a solution that was proportionate to the size of this problem that Hispanics are facing, this growing population,\u201d says Mason.\n\nJane Delgado, president of the National Alliance for Hispanic Health, says that while her organization provides similar services free of charge, there is always room for more organizations to keep the Hispanic community informed.\n\n\u201cPeople need to hear the message of a healthy lifestyle wherever they can,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue of redundancy for it to stick.\u201d\n\nSamuel Arce, chairman of the National Hispanic Medical Association, says that with immigration reform at the top of the White House\u2019s agenda, specialized Hispanic services will be even more relevant.\n\n\u201cIf you have massive reform, you have to take care of the needs of these individuals,\u201d says Dr. Arce. \u201cThey don\u2019t mind being productive, but you have to take care of them.\"\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services reported that 2.6 million Latinos have gained insurance coverage since the Affordable Care Act\u2019s first enrollment period closed in March. But even with access to services, Margarita Dilone, president of Crystal Insurance Group, says having a cultural and linguistic connection with a healthcare provider is key.\n\n\u201cWho else would be more qualified than a doctor who speaks your language and can understand your culture to help you access your medical needs,\u201d she says.\n\nAlong with providing access to physicians, ConsejoSano will offer videos, blogs, and articles about wellness. Once a subscriber is enrolled, his or her file will be kept online for doctors to review during each interaction.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "ea932db71c3159e740eda3acf6ccb373", "sailthru.author": "DeJonique Garrison", "description": "ConsejoSano mobile app connects documented and undocumented Latinos to healthcare providers who speak Spanish.", "sailthru.image.std": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2014/11/AHEALTH.jpg?alias=standard_380x253", "author": "The Christian Science Monitor", "og": {"site_name": "The Christian Science Monitor", "description": "ConsejoSano mobile app connects documented and undocumented Latinos to healthcare providers who speak Spanish.", "title": "New app brings 24/7 healthcare advice to Latino communities", "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/Technology/Responsible-Tech/2014/1119/New-app-brings-24-7-healthcare-advice-to-Latino-communities", "image": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2014/11/AHEALTH.jpg?alias=standard_900x600", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@csmonitor", "image": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2014/11/AHEALTH.jpg?alias=standard_380x253", "description": "ConsejoSano mobile app connects documented and undocumented Latinos to healthcare providers who speak Spanish.", "card": "summary", "title": "New app brings 24/7 healthcare advice to Latino communities"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-19", "DC.date.issued": "2014-11-19T10:18:39-05:00", "fb": {"page_id": 14660729657, "app_id": 179793002061452}, "sailthru.content.body": "http://www.csmonitor.com/layout/set/rssfull/Technology/Responsible-Tech/2014/1119/New-app-brings-24-7-healthcare-advice-to-Latino-communities", "sailthru.tags": "section-responsible-tech,section-technology,class-article,storysource-guest-blogger", "article": {"section": "Responsible Tech", "published_time": "2014-11-19T10:18-05"}, "copyright": "The Christian Science Monitor", "sailthru.image.credit": "Michael Chavez/SEIU/AP"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis is as close to universal healthcare that you can get with the help of technology,\u201d he says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an issue of redundancy for it to stick.\u201dSamuel Arce, chairman of the National Hispanic Medical Association, says that with immigration reform at the top of the White House\u2019s agenda, specialized Hispanic services will be even more relevant.\nAlong with providing access to physicians, ConsejoSano will offer videos, blogs, and articles about wellness.\nBut even with access to services, Margarita Dilone, president of Crystal Insurance Group, says having a cultural and linguistic connection with a healthcare provider is key.\nPeople wait to enter an Affordable Care Act enrollment event sponsored by SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West and Community Coalition, in Los Angeles on Nov. 15, 2014."}
