A vote on the new rules is expected to take place at the city council\u2019s meeting Tuesday night.\n\nThe exact rules are still unclear, but all personal trainers would be required to register with the mayor\u2019s office and pay a yet-to-be-determined fee. An early draft of the rules would have required that all personal trainers have a four-year degree.\n\nLike many licensing and regulatory schemes, this effort by the city government in D.C. is being pitched as being in the name of public health and safety \u2014 but there\u2019s really a more sinister motivation at play.\n\nPersonal training has been an explosive area of growth for entrepreneurs. There are more than 241,000 fitness trainers and aerobics instructors in the United States, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. The Washington, D.C., metro area has more than 5,800 people working in the industry, the third highest total for any metropolitan area in the nation. According to the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association, an industry group, the United States has more than 34,400 health clubs, a 28 percent increase over the past decade.\n\nAll those personal trainers are competition for physical therapists.\n\nThe Washington, D.C., Board of Physical Therapists, which is writing the new rules, just happens to be composed of five members \u2014 four of which are required by statute to be licensed physical therapists.\n\nThat board has now been given the power to regulate \u2014 potentially even to shut down \u2014 businesses that are in direct competition with the board\u2019s own members.\n\nThat\u2019s not government of the people, by the people or for the people.\n\nIt\u2019s a niche special interest using the regulatory power of the government to build a protective wall around its own interests, at the expense of other business owners and the general public. It\u2019s a cartel.\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of evidence that licensing requirements stifle the growth of new businesses and protect entrenched interests. That\u2019s not a side effect of protecting the public\u2019s health and safety; that\u2019s the reason why these rules exist. Protecting the public\u2019s health and safety \u2014 if licensing rules even do that, which is a matter up for debate \u2014 is merely the marketing strategy.\n\nEven the Obama Administration, which has no shortage of love for government regulations, recently acknowledged that licensing schemes are a bad idea. In a report released in July, the White House warned that excessive occupational licensing rules were limiting the growth of jobs and economic opportunity. It encouraged state and local governments to cut back on the red tape surrounding some professions.\n\nThe city government in D.C. apparently didn\u2019t read that report.\n\nWhen and if personal trainers are swept into the maelstrom of government regulation in Washington, D.C., they will have plenty of company. According to data compiled by The Economist, the city already requires a license for at least 40 percent of all jobs, including interior designers and tour guides.\n\nThat\u2019s right, you can\u2019t point to the Lincoln Memorial and explain the significance of the larger-than-life marble man seated inside it without first getting permission from bureaucrats.\n\nAnd soon, you won\u2019t be able to help someone sweat off a few pounds without one either.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "An obscure regulatory panel, the Board of Physical Therapy, is creating a new set of licensing rules for personal trainers working in the nation\u2019s capital.", "title": "Nanny State of the Week: D.C. flexing licensing muscles at personal trainers - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/09/shutterstock_188311025-e1442269081196.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-22T09:09:34+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/239056/nanny-state-week-d-c-flexing-licensing-muscles-personal-trainers/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Accountability", "published_time": "2015-09-21T12:01:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-22T09:09:34+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "An obscure regulatory panel, the Board of Physical Therapy, is creating a new set of licensing rules for personal trainers working in the nation\u2019s capital.", "title": "Nanny State of the Week: D.C. flexing licensing muscles at personal trainers - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/09/shutterstock_188311025-e1442269081196.jpg"}, "creator": "@ericboehm87", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "An obscure regulatory panel, the Board of Physical Therapy, is creating a new set of licensing rules for personal trainers working in the nation\u2019s capital."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd86dd\"", "article_summary": "When and if personal trainers are swept into the maelstrom of government regulation in Washington, D.C., they will have plenty of company.\nAn early draft of the rules would have required that all personal trainers have a four-year degree.\nThe exact rules are still unclear, but all personal trainers would be required to register with the mayor\u2019s office and pay a yet-to-be-determined fee.\nIn a report released in July, the White House warned that excessive occupational licensing rules were limiting the growth of jobs and economic opportunity.\nThe Washington, D.C., metro area has more than 5,800 people working in the industry, the third highest total for any metropolitan area in the nation."}
