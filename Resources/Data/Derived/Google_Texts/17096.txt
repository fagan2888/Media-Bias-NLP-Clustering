Grammy-winning musician Weird Al Yankovic was a guest on 6 In The Morning on Tuesday.

He has a full slate of activities planned in Tulsa and Claremore this week. Tuesday morning he talked to LeAnne Taylor about his new book and the movie "UHF" which was filmed in Tulsa 25 years ago.

At one of the events on Tuesday, Yankovic will help dedicate a Rogers State University supply closet named in his honor.

The closet in Markham Hall at RSU in Claremore will be known as the "Weird Al" Yankovic Supply Closet.

RSU says the supply closet was selected to honor Yankovic as a tribute to a famous scene in the movie "UHF" in which a closet holds an unexpected surprise.
