Markos is traveling today, so he left this week's nutpicking assignment to me. Today's source material will be the John Nolte movie review of "Godzilla," the new version, via the doomed city of Breitbart. (No links, but it is easy to find.) I'm becoming more and more impressed with Nolte's work; he may be the single best satirist of conservative culture out there, made all the better by his apparent unawareness that he's a satirist. He is well on his way to becoming a one-man Onion.

The central point of conservative movie criticism is, of course, to let the audience know if the persons involved with the movie need to be shunned. Nolte gets that out of the way early:



Director Gareth Edwards claims his summer blockbuster "Godzilla" is some sort of Global Warming cautionary tale. If that was his intent, unless you want to count the expected and clichéd platitudes about "controlling nature," he failed miserably (thank God). Saying such things might be a cynical attempt to win favor with elite critics, but what Edwards actually delivers where it counts -- up on the screen -- is a spectacularly mounted and unpretentious Godzilla romp that might be the best recruiting commercial for the United States Navy since Tony Scott's "Top Gun" (1986).

P.S. If you're intent on looking for a political message, here in America, only Barack Obama's Hawaii, Harry Reid's Nevada, and Nancy Pelosi's San Francisco are destroyed. Some kind of sub-conscious hostility towards the destructive leadership of the Democrat Party…? Why not.

Despite the involvement of a dreaded Unclean, Nolte's verdict is an enthusiastic thumbs-up, calling it "nearly the best Godzilla anyone could possibly make." A few paragraphs of praise, a few paragraphs of critique, yada yada yada and we close out the review with a nice, fat piece of hanging bait:Oh yeah, that's the stuff. So let's go below the fold and see how the audience responds, shall we?
