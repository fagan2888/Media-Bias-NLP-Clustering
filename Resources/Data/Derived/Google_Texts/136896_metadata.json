Salon contributor Roxane Gay, a writing professor at Eastern Illinois University, told me in an email, \u201cWhen people use the word actually in many contexts, they are implying that they have exclusive access to a font of incontrovertible knowledge. When they actually you, they are offering you a gift.\u201d\n\nTo find an example, Gay need look no further than the comments on her own articles. In a recent piece about the sexual abuse allegations against Woody Allen, commenter Rrhain wrote, \"Mia actually encouraged the two to spend time together when Soon-Yi was an adult. What other facts are you unaware of?\" Asked who is fond of actuallying her, Gay said that it\u2019s \u201cmostly men who are deeply passionate about \u2018truth\u2019 and \u2018fairness\u2019 and justice.\u2019\u201d\n\nUttering (or typing) actually at another person in pursuit of truth, fairness, and justice is a relatively new phenomenon. Google's Ngram Viewer, which charts the historical use of words and phrases in books, shows that printed use of actually has climbed steadily over the last two centuries. There's a caveat: This includes all uses of the word, not just in the grammatical instances being discussed here. But consider that its more pointed counterpart, well actually\u2014which is most often used in such instances\u2014has seen an extreme rise since the 1980s.\n\nStudies show that younger people are far more likely to use actually. From 2003-2004, linguist Cathleen Waters weighed data from a 1.7 million-word corpus of spoken English from Toronto, Canada, and found a steady increase in the word as age decreases. With the information collected from sociolinguistic interviews with 115 speakers, Waters published a 2008 paper called \u201cActually, it\u2019s more than pragmatics, it\u2019s really grammaticalization.\u201d\n\nShe found that the median rate of the use of actually among speakers ages 70-92 was 0.4 times per 1,000 words. In contrast, it was more than 1.5 times per 1,000 words for those between 18-39.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Waters, speakers between the ages of 18-30 use actually at an even higher rate than the 18-39 age group: an average rate of 2.24 occurrences per 1,000 words. Waters believes this is because actually has replaced older phrases like indeed and in fact through a gradual linguistic process called grammaticalization, wherein once-novel words become part of a speaker\u2019s register. The Ngram Viewer backs up that argument:\n\nActually's popularity seems only to have increased since 2008, when Waters' essay was published. It's become especially popular in partisan battles over issues ranging from Obamacare to gun control. \u201cI think the term actually is thought to be [used by] a group that trolls Twitter as fact-checkers, but in fact that\u2019s not always the way it\u2019s used,\u201d said Kira Hall, professor of Linguistics and Anthropology at University of Colorado Boulder. \u201cAnd if it is, fact-checking is happening from conservative to liberal stances as well as from liberal to conservative stances.\u201d Consider this Slate headline from earlier this year: \u201cActually, Electric Cars Are good for the planet.\u201d Or this one from The Weekly Standard: \"Actually, Hamas Killed the Palestinian Baby.\" Or this one from The New Republic: \"Actually, You Can't Just 'Restore' Cancelled Health Plans.\"\n\nThe use of actually has become so common, in fact, that it has become the source of humor and satire. Usage varies, but tweets bearing the hashtag #actually often aren't factual challenges but rather jokes about the petty overuse of the word itself.\n\n\"someone on the internet is being factually incorrect & i MUST rectify this\" - Someone about to make an #actually tweet \u2014 Desus (@desusnice) August 22, 2013\n\nRoses are red Violets are #ACTUALLY violet, not blue, am I the only one who remembers ROY G BIV \u2014 Meagan Hatcher-Mays (@ohmeags) February 14, 2014\n\nThe #WellActually hashtag, meanwhile, serves a different purpose: to mock or criticize Twitter users who are fond of using \u201cWell, actually\u2026\u201d in picking fights.\n\nthere is a whole category of people on Twitter that never talk except to #wellactually, it's so funny. *cues thinkpiece* \u2014 kate losse (@katelosse) March 3, 2014\n\nWell, Kate Losse, here's your thinkpiece\u2014and it's as good a sign as any that it's time to retire actually. The word has become so ubiquitous, and so abused, that its use barely registers a sting anymore. Before long, like literally before it, actually may lose its meaning altogether. Jessica Luther, a writer and prolific Twitter user whose position on reproductive rights has drawn quite a few actuallys, summed it perfectly for me: \u201cIt\u2019s one of those words you see and you know you\u2019re not going anywhere productive afterwards.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "For a 2000 paper titled \u201cActually and other markers of an apparent discrepancy between propositional attitudes of conversational partners,\u201d linguists Sara Smith and Andreas Jucker studied the conversational use of the word actually among friends and strangers at the University of California Long Beach.
