What happens when life sentences \u2026 aren\u2019t? The Associated Press reports that paroles of lifers in California have skyrocketed under Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s administration:\n\nSince Gov. Jerry Brown assumed office in January 2011, a record number of inmates with life sentences are winning parole. Brown has allowed the release of nearly 1,400 lifers, while going along with the parole board about 82 percent of the time. Brown\u2019s predecessor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, authorized the release of 557 lifers during his six-year term, sustaining the board at a 27 percent clip. Before that, Gov. Gray Davis over 3 years approved the release of two. This dramatic shift in releases under Brown comes as the state grapples with court orders to ease a decades-long prison crowding crisis that has seen triple bunking, prison gyms turned into dormitories and inmates shipped out of state. Crime victims and their advocates have said the releases are an injustice to the victims and that the parolees could pose a danger to the public. More than 80 percent of lifers are in prison for murder, while the remaining are mostly rapists and kidnappers. \u201cThis is playing Russian roulette with public safety,\u201d said Christine Ward, executive director of the Crime Victims Action Alliance. \u201cThis is a change of philosophy that can be dangerous.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that these life sentences are not the \u201clife without parole\u201d variety, but the kind that started off eligible for parole at some point in the future. The only way to undo the LWOP sentences would be executive acts of clemency. That, at least thus far, doesn\u2019t seem to be Brown\u2019s direction.\n\nIn fact, Brown defends these approvals by saying the court has forced his hand on prison overcrowding. He\u2019s blocked 100 paroles thus far, but can\u2019t issue vetoes at the same rate and expect to comply with judicial orders to lower prison populations. Assuming that doesn\u2019t do the trick, and California doesn\u2019t add prison space, how long before judges start looking at LWOP cases? Or for that matter, California\u2019s death-row roster, most of whom wait decades before facing the executioner?\n\nCalifornia needs to make some tough decisions on incarceration, sentencing, and investment in prisons. This is just another symptom of the state\u2019s governing class kicking those decisions down the road for far too long.\n\nRecently in the Green Room:", "article_metadata": {"description": "California paroling record number of lifers under Jerry Brown", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Greenroom", "description": "Opponents of the death penalty \u2014 myself among them \u2014 argue that life sentences are enough to keep society safe.
