"This is a time for choosing," Pence said at the start of the 30-second ad, titled "Pence for Cruz."

The Texas senator is hoping Pence's endorsement will sway voters.

"All of America is looking to Indiana to make a choice," Pence says in the ad. "I'm a Reagan conservative. I see Ted Cruz as a principled conservative who's dedicated his career to advocating the Reagan agenda."

In the ad, Pence said he admires how Cruz has "been willing to stand up for tax payers in opposing runaway spending" and respects the Texas senator's continued calls to repeal ObamaCare.

"I will be voting for Ted Cruz," Pence says at the end of the ad.

When Pence first endorsed Cruz on Friday, he offered praise for both Cruz and Trump, saying he wanted to "commend Donald Trump, who I think has given voice to the frustration of millions of working Americans with a lack of progress in Washington, D.C."
