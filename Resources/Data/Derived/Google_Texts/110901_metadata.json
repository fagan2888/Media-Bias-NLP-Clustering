Looks like schools need an exemption from ObamaCare.\n\nIt\u2019s a problem that most school systems face, finding enough qualified substitute teachers.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s difficult in itself to find the subs that we need,\u201d says Marshall County School Superintendent Tim Nabors. \u201cOf course we would love to have certified subs. But sometimes that\u2019s difficult to obtain.\u201d\n\nNabors says it could get worse next school year as the system becomes subject to the rules of the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare as the President calls it.\n\nThe law says anyone working more than 30 hours a week for the same employer must be offered health care benefits. That would apply to substitute teachers.\n\n\u201cWhen they can only work so many hours a week, it puts an even bigger burden on us,\u201d Nabors says. \u201cIf those subs, if we have to have them, they work over that, we either have to offer them insurance or have to pay a fine, which of course hurts us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "ObamaCare: It's making life worse everywhere.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "ObamaCare: It's making life worse everywhere.", "title": "ObamaCare Causes Substitute Teacher Shortage", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/218485/obamacare-causes-substitute-teacher-shortage-daniel-greenfield", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:47:10-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/218485/obamacare-causes-substitute-teacher-shortage-daniel-greenfield", "description": "ObamaCare: It's making life worse everywhere.", "card": "summary", "title": "ObamaCare Causes Substitute Teacher Shortage"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-12T10:57:38-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:47:10-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9e5d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhen they can only work so many hours a week, it puts an even bigger burden on us,\u201d Nabors says.\n\u201cThat\u2019s difficult in itself to find the subs that we need,\u201d says Marshall County School Superintendent Tim Nabors.\nThe law says anyone working more than 30 hours a week for the same employer must be offered health care benefits.\nIt\u2019s a problem that most school systems face, finding enough qualified substitute teachers.\nLooks like schools need an exemption from ObamaCare."}
