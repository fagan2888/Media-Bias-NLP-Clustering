People who wanted to head up the mountain today have a long wait ahead if they didn't set out early.

The Pima County Sheriff's Department just announced that the Catalina Highway – the most direct way for most people to get up Mount Lemmon – is closed due to overcrowding on the mountain.

During closures, no traffic is allowed up the mountain unless by employees or residents of the mountain.

The status of the roadway can change at any time, so several motorists who still hope to make a day in the snow have pulled to the side of the road, hoping the highway will reopen, according to KOLD reporter Cynthia Washington, who is at the scene.

Earlier Sunday, the PCSD was allowing one vehicle up each time one came down. Before noon, traffic was backed up from Milepost 0 – the base of the mountain – all the way to Tanque Verde Road.

"Because of the overwhelming demand, the road may be shut down entirely at any time," Deputy Courtney Rodriguez wrote in an email.

Saturday marked the first time this season that the Mount Lemmon Ski Valley opened its slopes for skiing, following a week in which the mountain got 30 inches of snow, giving skiers a snow base of 40 inches.

To get the most up-to-date information, call the Pima County Sheriff's Department road closure hotline at 520-547-7510.
