End-times prophecy sends a strong message to Christians to know the signs of Jesus' return – but one well-known pastor is concerned many Christians don't know those signs and might not be fully prepared.

Dr. Robert Jeffress of First Baptist Church, Dallas was a guest on American Family Radio Monday talking about his new book Perfect Ending: Why Your Future Matters Today. Jeffress contends end-times prophecy isn't preached often – but Christians, he argues, need to be knowledgeable.

"We cannot know when the Lord is going to return," he stated. "In Matthew 24, Jesus said to his disciples No man knows the day or the hour, not even the Son of God himself – and I tell people if Christ doesn't know when he's returning, I sure don't know."

The key to understanding Bible prophecy, he said, is to understand God's plan for Israel because the Bible says in the end days the Jewish nation will once again be a focus – and it is today, he added.

During the radio interview, the pastor shared his belief that President Obama and other world leaders are paving the way for the Antichrist.

"[President Obama] was able to confiscate or usurp one-sixth of the nation's economy through Obamacare. He is the first president to launch an unprecedented attack against God's people," Jeffress said.

"Thirdly, he's the first president to propose a change of God's most basic moral law about marriage being between a man and a woman. He was able to do this and win re-election by a comfortable margin."

Jeffress believes people are being conditioned to give up their rights for a so-called "greater good."
