She is also the personality behind 12WBT, an interactive online diet and fitness program in a country for which obesity rates have grown to 63 percent in recent years.\n\nSince 12WBT was introduced in January 2010 in Australia, more than 250,000 people have joined at $176. Now she's bringing 12WBT to the United States, along with the rest of her brand, in an attempt to gain a share of the lucrative diet industry.\n\nIt remains to be seen, though, if there's room for another fitness guru in a saturated field.\n\nBridges, 43, has bright blue eyes, a deep orangy tan and shoulders that seem more like a diagram of the muscular system.\n\nBridges enters a country flush with homegrown diet and fitness gurus. There are a host of people like Tracy Anderson, Shaun T and Jillian Michaels, determined to get people down to fighting weight.\n\nRenee Miles, a 34-year-old corrections officer who lives in Brooklyn with her five children, weighed 254 pounds when she and some co-workers bet on who could lose the most weight in the run-up to the holidays. Miles had joined Instagram looking for friends and maybe some diet tips when she was targeted by 12WBT's free five-week trial program, used to test the American market.\n\nShe had tried everything from Weight Watchers, where she had lost weight temporarily but found that her skin was flabby from lack of exercise, to the Insanity workout by Shaun T, which left her knees in pain from all the jumping.\n\nMiles received guidance at the gym through the 12 Week Body Transformation Sneak Preview. She learned which machines to use and how to use them. She could print prepared shopping lists for the grocery store.\n\n\"The mind-frame thing is the difference,\" she said. \"It makes you a stronger person.\"\n\nBy the end of the five weeks, Miles had lost 23 pounds. As the test run ended, participants were encouraged to meet with Bridges at a dance studio in Manhattan where they could work out with her.\n\nMiles attended for what she said was the toughest workout of her life. When she approached Bridges afterward, Miles began to cry.\n\n\"She didn't realize what she did for me was she changed my life,\" she said of Bridges. \"You never know what your body could do until you do it. If you told me you were going to run on a treadmill for 15 minutes, I'd say you were out of your mind. It's only your mind that thinks you can't.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/01/hffit21.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "It remains to be seen, though, if there's room for another fitness guru in a saturated field.\nAs the test run ended, participants were encouraged to meet with Bridges at a dance studio in Manhattan where they could work out with her.\nShe is also the personality behind 12WBT, an interactive online diet and fitness program in a country for which obesity rates have grown to 63 percent in recent years.\nBridges enters a country flush with homegrown diet and fitness gurus.\nAt any given point there are more than 100 people working on her brand, but there is only one Michelle Bridges."}
