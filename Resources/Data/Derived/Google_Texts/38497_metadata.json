Former state Rep. Terry Hayes, nominated by Republicans on Tuesday, defeated Neria Douglass in a secret ballot vote by the joint convention.\n\nAdditional Photos Maine's secretary of state, now Matthew Dunlap, right, would be replaced by a lieutenant governor, under Gov. LePage's proposal. The attorney general, now Janet Mills, left, and treasurer, now Terry Hayes, center, would be chosen by the governor rather than the Legislature.

However, it couldn\u2019t protect Douglass. Hayes was considered the toughest challenger because she had the potential to peel off enough of her former Democratic colleagues.\n\nRepublicans on Tuesday took the unusual step of nominating Hayes, a move that could fuel future attempts to drive a wedge in their caucus and diminish their influence in negotiating the state\u2019s next two-year budget and other proposals of significance.\n\nLePage had made defeating Mills a personal priority. The governor has clashed with her a number of times and has said that her re-election would signal Democrats\u2019 unwillingness to work with him during his second term. He\u2019s also advocated for changing the way Maine elects the attorney general.\n\nMaine is the only state in which the Legislature elects its top law official, according to the National Association of Attorneys General. Forty-three states and the District of Columbia popularly elect their attorneys general, and the position is appointed by the governor in five states. In Tennessee, the Supreme Court fills the position.\n\nTensions between Mills and Republican Gov. Paul LePage have prompted the governor and others to suggest that Maine should change its constitution so that the position is popularly elected as it is in other states. A change to the constitution would require support of two-thirds support of the Legislature and approval from voters.\n\nMoving to a popularly elected attorney general could invite spending by outside interest groups attempting to influence future elections.\n\nEarlier this year the Center for Public Integrity found that outside interest groups spent $8 million on 10 attorney general races in 2012, according to an analysis of data from the National Institute on Money in State Politics and state and federal campaign finance filings.\n\nThere are several reasons for the spending.\n\nIn Maine and other states, the attorney general serves in a number of capacities, including giving legal advice to state agencies, the governor and the Legislature. The office\u2019s duties often collide with, and can advance, public policy, particularly if the legislative or executive branch asks the attorney general to find a legal reason to join or justify a proposal. That was the case in 2011 when Republican Attorney General William Schneider joined more than 20 other Republican-led states to challenge the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAttorneys general also join and oversee consumer protection lawsuits on behalf of their states. One of the biggest spenders on attorney general races in 2012 was the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, whose business constituents could be affected by such lawsuits.\n\nAdditionally, popularly elected attorneys general are often considered future gubernatorial candidates.\n\nA major spender in the 2014 election was the Republican Attorneys General Association, a tax-exempt group that raised over $7.4 million, according to data complied by the Center for Responsive Politics.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In secret ballot votes, Democratic Attorney General Janet Mills and Secretary of State Matt Dunlap win, while independent Terry Hayes supplants Neria Douglass as treasurer.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "In secret ballot votes, Democratic Attorney General Janet Mills and Secretary of State Matt Dunlap win, while independent Terry Hayes supplants Neria Douglass as treasurer.", "title": "Maine Legislature re-elects two Democratic officers - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/mills-hayes-dunlap.jpg", "height": 259}, "updated_time": "2014-12-03T20:51:28-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/12/03/maine-legislature-re-elects-two-democratic-officers/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In secret ballot votes, Democratic Attorney General Janet Mills and Secretary of State Matt Dunlap win, while independent Terry Hayes supplants Neria Douglass as treasurer.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/mills-hayes-dunlap.jpg", "title": "Maine Legislature re-elects two Democratic officers - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "News", "published_time": "2014-12-03T16:49:59-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-03T20:51:28-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "He\u2019s also advocated for changing the way Maine elects the attorney general.\nIn Maine and other states, the attorney general serves in a number of capacities, including giving legal advice to state agencies, the governor and the Legislature.\nMoving to a popularly elected attorney general could invite spending by outside interest groups attempting to influence future elections.\nOne of the biggest spenders on attorney general races in 2012 was the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, whose business constituents could be affected by such lawsuits.\nThe attorney general, now Janet Mills, left, and treasurer, now Terry Hayes, center, would be chosen by the governor rather than the Legislature."}
