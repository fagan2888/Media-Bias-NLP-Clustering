Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. \u201cIt would result in consumer confusion and prevent disclosure of straightforward, consistent calorie information at many food service establishments.\u201d\n\nA recent study released by Harvard showed that menu labeling could prevent up to 41,000 cases of child obesity and save more than $4.6 billion in health care costs over 10 years.\n\nAlso, a national poll found about 80 percent of Americans support menu labeling.\n\nThe federal requirement for menu labeling at restaurants with more than 20 sites passed six years ago, as part of the Affordable Care Act, but lobbying by the food industry delayed implementation. The chief opponents of labeling are the Food Marketing Institute, a supermarket trade group, and the American Pizza Community, led by Domino\u2019s Pizza.\n\nA coalition of more than 100 health and nutrition groups, including the American Cancer Society, American Heart Association and American Diabetes Association opposes the congressional attempt to weaken the rule.\n\n\u201cWe do not think that it is common sense to weaken a policy that would allow people to make their own, informed choices about how many calories to eat at a time when obesity rates are at a record high,\u201d the groups said in a joint statement.\n\nThe health and nutrition advocates now are focused on the Senate, where Republican Roy Blunt of Missouri has introduced a companion bill.\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nAmericans eat and drink about one-third of their calories away from home, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which has proposed a rule requiring the posting of calorie information on chain restaurant menus.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. House recently voted to gut the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s proposed rule for calorie counts on menus at restaurant chains.", "og": {"site_name": "Wisconsin Gazette", "description": "The U.S. House recently voted to gut the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s proposed rule for calorie counts on menus at restaurant chains.", "title": "House votes to gut FDA menu rules", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://wisconsingazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/image-news-diet-rules-c.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-10T10:34:56-05:00", "url": "http://wisconsingazette.com/2016/03/12/house-votes-to-gut-fda-menu-rules/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The U.S. House recently voted to gut the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s proposed rule for calorie counts on menus at restaurant chains.", "creator": "@lisaneff", "image": "http://wisconsingazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/image-news-diet-rules-c.jpg", "title": "House votes to gut FDA menu rules - Wisconsin Gazette", "site": "@wigazette", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 656359844}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wigazette/", "published_time": "2016-03-12T19:34:21-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/lmneff", "section": "Dining", "modified_time": "2016-03-10T10:34:56-05:00", "tag": "politics"}, "google-site-verification": "seM7rhmcUuSzBWv6kkeJ_YZI5fL-A0v6VtNwwuSnfkc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Also, a national poll found about 80 percent of Americans support menu labeling.\nThe legislation, the Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act \u2014 with bipartisan sponsorship and strong support from the restaurant industry \u2014 is now before the Senate.\nThe U.S. House recently voted to gut the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s proposed rule for calorie counts on menus at restaurant chains.\nThe federal requirement for menu labeling at restaurants with more than 20 sites passed six years ago, as part of the Affordable Care Act, but lobbying by the food industry delayed implementation.\nThe health and nutrition advocates now are focused on the Senate, where Republican Roy Blunt of Missouri has introduced a companion bill."}
