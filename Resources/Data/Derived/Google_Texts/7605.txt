A Hays man was killed, and a teen suffered critical injuries in a wrong-way crash involving a semi on Interstate 70.

It happened around 11:45 p.m. Friday, about a mile and a half east of Hays. The Kansas Highway Patrol said a Dodge pickup was heading the wrong way on I-70 and stuck a westbound Kia hatchback. Both vehicles came to rest in the left lane where they were hit by a semi.

The driver of the Kia, 37-year-old Douglas Feldt, died at the scene. The driver of the pickup, 19-year-old Cameron Wade of Great Bend, was flown to a Wichita hospital with critical injuries. Reports state neither driver was wearing a seat belt.

The semi driver was not hurt.

Further details were not released. The accident is still under investigation.
