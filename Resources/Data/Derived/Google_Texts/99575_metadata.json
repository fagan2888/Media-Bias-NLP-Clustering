It\u2019s a milestone they\u2019ve been looking forward to as they aim to beat the world record of the longest-living conjoined twins in October, when they will turn 63.\n\nBorn in 1951 in Dayton, Ohio, the Galyon brothers were joined from the sternum to the groin and shared organs, unable to be separated. Their father, Wesley, decided to take them on the road as a sideshow attraction in the 1950s and 1960s, bringing in a large sum of money with which they were able to support themselves and the rest of their family. In 1991, the brothers moved into their first home independently, where they were able to take care of themselves with the help of their brother Jim.\n\nHowever, from 2009 to 2010, the twins suffered a viral infection that left them in poor condition. As a result, their brother Jim offered to have them move in with him, and built a handicapped-accessible extension to his home to accommodate them. Since then, the brothers have been happy and healthy, especially after the Christian Youth Corps helped build a special bed that matches the configuration of their bodies. \u201cNow, every day, I wake up from this bed feeling relaxed and refreshed,\u201d Ronnie told MLive. \u201cAfter having this bed here, I wake up every day and have a big smile on my face.\u201d\n\nDonnie and Ronnie, despite having fights when they were younger, consider themselves best friends and have had a fun life. They have also learned how to deal with the strange reactions people give them, but say the good makes up for the bad. \u201cYou see the warmest of hearts, and you see the coldest of hearts, and a little bit in-between,\u201d their brother Jim told MLive.\n\n\u201cThey are special,\u201d Jim continued. \u201cIt\u2019s been an up-and-down road taking care of them, but it\u2019s been worth every moment. They are alive, and they are happy. They are healthy, and they\u2019re free.\u201d\n\nTo see pictures of the Galyon twins throughout their infancy and childhood into adulthood, check out the Dayton Daily News.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "conjoined twins, ronnie and donnie galyon", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Donnie and Ronnie Galyon have reached a milestone in becoming the longest-living conjoined twins in the world.", "title": "World\u2019s Oldest Conjoined Twins Outlive Famous 19th Century \u2018Siamese Twins\u2019 [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/worlds-oldest-conjoined-twins-outlive-famous-siamese-twins-eng-and-chang-bunker-291512", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/05/conjoined-twins-donnie-and-ronnie-galyon.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Donnie and Ronnie Galyon have reached a milestone in becoming the longest-living conjoined twins in the world.", "title": "World\u2019s Oldest Conjoined Twins Outlive Famous 19th Century \u2018Siamese Twins\u2019 [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/worlds-oldest-conjoined-twins-outlive-famous-siamese-twins-eng-and-chang-bunker-291512", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/05/conjoined-twins-donnie-and-ronnie-galyon.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/05/conjoined-twins-donnie-and-ronnie-galyon.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-07-05T12:21:23-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-05T12:21:22-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Donnie and Ronnie Galyon have reached a milestone in becoming the longest-living conjoined twins in the world."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1631\"", "article_summary": "\u201cYou see the warmest of hearts, and you see the coldest of hearts, and a little bit in-between,\u201d their brother Jim told MLive.\nThey are healthy, and they\u2019re free.\u201dTo see pictures of the Galyon twins throughout their infancy and childhood into adulthood, check out the Dayton Daily News.\nThe world\u2019s oldest living conjoined twins \u2014 Ohio brothers Donnie and Ronnie Galyon \u2014 soon hope to beat the world record for the longest-living pair of twins joined at the body.\nBorn in 1951 in Dayton, Ohio, the Galyon brothers were joined from the sternum to the groin and shared organs, unable to be separated.\nToday, Donnie and Ronnie are 62 years, 8 months and 7 days old \u2014 outliving the famous \u201cSiamese twins\u201d Eng and Chang Bunker, who lived in the 1800s."}
