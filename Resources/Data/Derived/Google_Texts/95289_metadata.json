Kids attending Faith Keepers School in Steamburg, New York, learn about Seneca tradition, culture and are taught the language through activities. During varsity and junior varsity lacrosse games in Gowanda, you\u2019ll hear the games being announced in Seneca by eighth grade students. According to WGRZ, they are the first school in Western New York to announce games like that.\n\nThere\u2019s a bigger push to preserve the language because our elders are dying,\u201d teacher Rachael Wolfe told WGRZ. \u201cIt\u2019s urgent... We\u2019re at an emergency status as far as our language is concerned.\u201d\n\nNorma Kennedy, 85, is one of the elders who still speaks the language. \u201cI was immersed in it. My mother and father spoke the language. Everyone in the neighborhood spoke Seneca so it was easy for me to pick it up.\u201d\n\nBut Kennedy also remembers attending a one-room school house where Native American children were disciplined for speaking their language. Kennedy is working with the adult language class to pass on her knowledge of the language and keep it alive.\n\nStudents can study the Seneca language and earn a second language credit at Gowanda and Salamanca.\n\nTechnology is being utilized to preserve the language as well\u2014a written version is being catalogued. Robbie Jimerson, who graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology and lives on the Cattaraugus Indian Reservation, is developing a user-friendly computer catalog so future generations can study and speak the language.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an online dictionary. So you\u2019ll be able to put in an English word and it will give you the Seneca translation for it,\u201d he told WGRZ.\n\nSaving the language is important to preserving the culture as well. \u201cThe main portion of our culture is language and if we don\u2019t have language, we really don\u2019t a have a culture,\u201d Seneca language teacher Jacky Yallup told WGRZ. \u201cWe can\u2019t carry on our ceremonies, we can\u2019t carry on daily living without our language.\u201d\n\nSee the full story and video at WGRZ.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the three Seneca territories in Western New York there are just 30 elders who speak the language fluently\u201410 years ago there were 200.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/06/language-key-culture-seneca-fight-save-theirs-156262", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/saving-seneca-language.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Language Is Key to Culture: Seneca Fight to Save Theirs"}, "abstract": "In the three Seneca territories in Western New York there are just 30 elders who speak the language fluently\u201410 years ago there were 200.", "dc": {"title": "Language Is Key to Culture: Seneca Fight to Save Theirs"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/06/language-key-culture-seneca-fight-save-theirs-156262", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Seneca Nation of Indians, Native American Languages, Native American Language Preservation, Boarding Schools", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2014-08-06T12:30-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Language Is Key to Culture: Seneca Fight to Save Theirs"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde866\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe main portion of our culture is language and if we don\u2019t have language, we really don\u2019t a have a culture,\u201d Seneca language teacher Jacky Yallup told WGRZ.\nStudents can study the Seneca language and earn a second language credit at Gowanda and Salamanca.\nKids attending Faith Keepers School in Steamburg, New York, learn about Seneca tradition, culture and are taught the language through activities.\nThe Seneca Nation of Indians is trying to change that and save their language starting with the youth.\nThere\u2019s a bigger push to preserve the language because our elders are dying,\u201d teacher Rachael Wolfe told WGRZ."}
