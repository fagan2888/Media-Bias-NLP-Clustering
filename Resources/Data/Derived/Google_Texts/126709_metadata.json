(WSAZ) -- The rush is on as last-minute shoppers pack into grocery stores around the area, grabbing those Thanksgiving essentials. Glen Robertson is taking on the big task while his wife is a bit under the weather.\n\n\"Everybody waits until the last minute, and I do Christmas the same way,\" Robertson said.\n\nBecky Hughes is also an admitted procrastinator, but she has a good excuse.\n\n\"You don't want to get (the food) too early if you're making it from scratch because your ingredients go bad,\" Hughes said.\n\nHughes believes most people are simply too busy to get to the grocery store ahead of the holiday.\n\n\"People work,\" Hughes said. \"They have other things they're doing. So, it just gets pushed and pushed.\"\n\nMartin Hicks is the manager of the Foodfair in Barboursville. He says it's the same story every year.\n\n\"Usually the 10 days before Thanksgiving is when it really starts to get busy,\" Hicks said, \"and it just starts getting busier every day as you get close to the holiday.\"\n\nHicks says for most people, buying everything for a Thanksgiving feast can lead to making multiple trips to the store.\n\n\"People a lot of time will do their big shopping and then come back several times to get all the things they forgot the first time or second time,\" Hicks said. \"Sometimes people come in three or four times in the week just to keep picking up little things until they're ready for the event.\"\n\nHicks says shoppers best bet is to come early to avoid big crowds. He says peak hours are usually between 4 to 7 p.m.\n\nDespite the stress of shopping and cooking, shoppers say it's all worth giving thanks with friends and family.\n\n\"It's just good to get together, even if it was stressful getting there,\" Hughes said. \"It's always fun.\"\n\nClick the link to find out which grocery stores will be open to shoppers on Thanksgiving Day.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The rush is on as last-minute shoppers pack into grocery stores around the area, grabbing those Thanksgiving essentials.", "language": "english", "author": "Brad Myers", "og": {"description": "The rush is on as last-minute shoppers pack into grocery stores around the area, grabbing those Thanksgiving essentials.", "title": "Grocery stores see rush of last-minute shoppers before Thanksgiving", "url": "http://www.wsaz.com/home/headlines/Grocery-stores-see-rush-of-last-minute-shoppers-before-Thanksgiving-353976411.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/A3D/D5D/A3DD5D2D8C3949589A291D4BB41B0C2D", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/1EB/030/1EB03087433941C78D8434BDE09AE300.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wsaz.com", "description": "The rush is on as last-minute shoppers pack into grocery stores around the area, grabbing those Thanksgiving essentials.", "title": "Grocery stores see rush of last-minute shoppers before Thanksgiving", "url": "http://www.wsaz.com/news/huntingtonnews/headlines/Grocery-stores-see-rush-of-last-minute-shoppers-before-Thanksgiving-353976411.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/grocery+aisle.jpg", "creator": "@WSAZnews", "site": "@WSAZnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "fb": {"app_id": 589941277838654}, "keywords": "Grocery stores see rush of last-minute shoppers before Thanksgiving", "google-site-verification": "rnQvGTE5yUwyFE9BUQbKDfpuwACWSv9dy_JXjEFO1WY", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Grocery stores see rush of"}, "article_summary": "Related LinksThanksgiving Day Grocery Store HoursHUNTINGTON, W.Va.
