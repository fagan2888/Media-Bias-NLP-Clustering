Small in stature, but mighty in spirit. That is how some are describing a local woman who turned 100 Saturday.

Mrs. Alean Portis bell from Cuba, Alabama turned 100. She celebrated her big day with friends and family in Meridian at the Holiday Inn on Frontage Rd. In all, there were 11 different states represented at the birthday party. Everyone was wanting to give back the love and support Mrs. Bell has given to them throughout the years.

"One thing, you know, is the most important thing in life is just to keep your eyes on Jesus. Just follow him because we going to have a lot of ups and downs in this life, you know, but as long as you're able to look up and have faith and trust him-- you'll make it. You'll make it honey."

We spoke to several of Mrs. Bell's family members, and they all agree that she is the one who instilled love into their lives.
