It is designed to address controversial city ordinances, as in Houston, which would open bathrooms, showers, and dressing facilities to all, regardless of gender, gender identity, or gender expression. The bill criminalizes entering a shower or toilet facility designated for the opposite sex.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAs previously reported by Breitbart Texas, Houston Mayor Anise Parker, the city\u2019s first openly gay mayor, told the media that passing the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (\u201cHERO\u201d) was not the most important thing she has done while in office, but it is the \u201cmost personally meaningful thing I will ever do as mayor.\u201d The 31-page ordinance added an equal rights chapter in the municipal code that created rights in not only public accommodation, but housing, city employment, city contracting, and private employment. The transgender ordinance allows bath, shower, and locker facilities to be open to anyone dressed in female attire, without regard to biological sex. The ordinance has been suspended because there is litigation pending.\n\nPlano, Texas passed a similar ordinance in December 2014 \u201cprohibiting discrimination in places of public accommodation, employment practices, housing transactions and city contracting practices.\u201d Breitbart Texas reported that critics claimed that the ordinance infringes on religious liberty and may allow men to use women\u2019s bathrooms.\n\nPlanet Fitness has recently had its facilities boycotted for similar policies. The US Pastor Council reported that the American Family Association, a Christian activist organization, is boycotting Planet Fitness gyms because it has an \u201call-inclusive policy,\u201d one that \u201callows self-reporting transgenders to use locker and shower rooms designated for the opposite sex.\u201d\n\nTexas State Representative Debbie Riddle (R-Tomball) has filed a bill that would make it a Class A misdemeanor for a person of the opposite gender who is 13 years or older to enter facilities that are designated for use by persons of the opposite sex.\n\nThe bill also makes it a state jail felony offense for an operator, manager, superintendent, or other person with authority over a \u201cbuilding\u201d to allow an individual who is 7 years or older to repeatedly enter facilities designated for persons of the opposite gender. \u201cBuilding\u201d is defined under the bill as \u201ca public building, schoolhouse, theater, filling station, tourist court, bus station, or tavern.\u201d\n\nUnder House Bill 1748, \u201cgender\u201d for purposes of the bill is designated as \u201cthe gender established at the individual\u2019s birth or the gender established by the individual\u2019s chromosomes.\u201d A male is defined as \u201can individual with at least one X chromosome and at least one Y chromosome.\u201d A female is defined as \u201can individual with at least one X chromosome and no Y chromosomes.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cBathroom Bill\u201d further provides that \u201cIf an individual\u2019s gender established at the individual\u2019s birth is not the same as the individual\u2019s gender established by the individual\u2019s chromosomes, the individual\u2019s gender established by the individual\u2019s chromosomes controls under this section.\u201d\n\nIt would be a defense to prosecution under this law if an individual enters the locker room, or shower or toilet facility for a custodial purpose, to render medical assistance, or to accompany a child younger than eight years of age and of a gender that is not the same sex as the individual\u2019s gender.\n\nBreitbart Texas spoke to Rep. Riddle and she said \u201cMy \u2018Bathroom Bill\u2019 is simple common sense \u2013 men go to the men\u2019s room, and women go to the women\u2019s restroom. It protects the privacy and safety of women and children.\u201d She continued \u201cIt is sad we even need a bill like this in today\u2019s society.\u201d\n\nThe law would take effect September 1st of this year. Rep. Dan Flynn (R-Canton) is a co-author of the bill.\n\nLana Shadwick is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.
