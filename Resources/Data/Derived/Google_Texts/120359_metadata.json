One is that it\u2019s unclear whether or to what extent these lower rates will translate into benefit or coverage changes for actual seniors. Another is that they\u2019ve spent the past several years talking up the urgent importance of slashing entitlement spending. But a third is that Republicans have voted for these same cuts many, many times since Obama\u2019s been in office, have refused to remove the cuts from their own budgets even as they\u2019ve attacked Democrats in multiple election cycles for raiding Medicare, and, broadly speaking, support the cuts on the merits.\n\nThis fundamental inconsistency is well known to reporters, and in many other circumstances that would militate toward nixing the Medicare attacks altogether. But Medicare attacks are unusually politically potent, so Republicans have decided it\u2019s worth enduring accusations of hypocrisy if that\u2019s what it takes to continue them.\n\nThat means they need answers for the press, though, and the only way for them to square their budgets and their Medicare attacks is through sheer bamboozlement. They think you don\u2019t know how to read a budget, and are too stupid to figure it out.\n\nWhen confronted, they retreat from pretending to oppose the cuts on the merits, to claiming the real problem is that Democrats used the savings from the cuts to fund Obamacare. But this is a non sequitur. A diversion. The attacks specifically express outrage on behalf of seniors who, Republicans claim, will lose doctors or get stuck with higher premiums specifically as a result of the ACA\u2019s Medicare Advantage cuts.\n\nObama Admin Changes to MA, Prescription Drug Program Harmful to America\u2019s Seniors, read GOP leadership letter: http://t.co/NHkgzbYwqp \u2014 Senator John Thune (@SenJohnThune) February 25, 2014\n\nBut remember, Republicans actually support the cuts. All of these supposedly horrible things would happen under their plan, too, regardless of how the savings are spent. So right away it\u2019s clear that the attacks are straightforwardly deceitful.\n\nBut Republicans actually redouble the bamboozlement by then claiming their budget proposes using the savings to \u201cstrengthen Medicare,\u201d while Democrats \u201cdouble count\u201d them \u2014 i.e. simultaneously claim to have improved Medicare\u2019s finances, and used the savings to finance Obamacare. When you hear those words, remember that whoever spoke them thinks you can\u2019t read and don\u2019t understand fairly simple accounting.\n\nRepublicans would have you believe that they contemplate storing the savings from these cuts in a bank vault somewhere to draw upon in the years ahead for the sole purpose of financing future Medicare benefits, whereas Democrats waste the savings on Obummercare. But that\u2019s not how Medicare finance works or how the federal budget works or how any particular budget proposal works.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans voted many times to cut overpayments to Medicare carriers.
