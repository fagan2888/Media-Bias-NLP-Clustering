Meanwhile in Washington, Senate Democrats continued to block a vote on legislation meant to stop human trafficking and help victims because of a provision that prevents public funds from paying for abortions. Guy debunks their false talking points here. Reid\u2019s also preparing to block another bipartisan bill over abortion funding.\n\nObamacare\n\nAs we marked the five year anniversary of Obamacare this week, the president said the law is a stunning success: \u201cEvery prediction they made about it turned out to be wrong,\u201d he said in Cleveland on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s working better than even I expected.\u201d National Journal\u2019s Ron Fournier took conservatives to task over their continued efforts to repeal and replace the law\u2014and things escalated quickly.\n\nCampaigns & Elections\n\n\n\n\n\nElection season has officially gotten underway with Sen. Ted Cruz announcing on Monday that he is running for president, thus becoming the first entrant into the GOP race. Though, like President Obama, Cruz is only a one-term senator and lacks the executive experience, he defended his candidacy on \u201cThe Kelly File\u201d this week and stressed the importance of a conservative win in 2016. While there are naysayers, Cruz is constitutionally eligible to be president; even Al Sharpton had to concede he\u2019s \u201callegable.\u201d Next up to announce their candidacy? Sen. Rand Paul, who will formally declare in early April. He\u2019s also already taking some soft shots at Cruz. And DNC \"factivists\" are already getting to work.\n\nAnd in other election news: Sens. Harry Reid and Dan Coats announced they plan to step down in 2016; the Democratic representative who unseated Allen West will be running for Rubio\u2019s Senate seat; and Boston Globe\u2019s editorial board is practically begging Elizabeth Warren to run.\n\nForeign Policy\n\nNuclear negotiations with Iran went from bad to worse this week. Just one day after President Obama urged Iran to seize a \u2018historic opportunity\u2019 to reach a deal, the country\u2019s supreme leader chanted \u2018Death to America\u2019 after telling a crowd in Tehran that it would \u2018not capitulate to Western demands.\u2019 And they certainly aren\u2019t. The U.S. not only brushed this off rhetoric, but also agreed to allow Iran to maintain centrifuges in a fortified underground bunker\u2026oh, and any \u201cdeal\u201d we come to likely won\u2019t even be in writing. Both Rubio and Walker said that if they became president they\u2019d immediately scrap Obama\u2019s Iran deal. In related news, the White House found out this week that Israeli intelligence had been eavesdropping on our negotiations and then used that information to try to lobby Congress against a deal. Meanwhile, the White House continues to believe we\u2019ve \u201csucceeded\u201d in Yemen even as its president fled rebels and al Qaeda took control of a key city.\n\nBergdahl\n\nThe U.S. Army announced official charges against Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl this week, including one count of desertion and one count of misbehavior before the enemy. If convicted, Bergdahl could face life in prison. After Bergdahl was released this summer in a swap for five Taliban prisoners, members of his platoon came forward with details about Bergdahl\u2019s disappearance. They claimed he violated his oath and left on his own accord. Now, even though their statements have been vindicated, State Department Deputy Press Secretary Marie Harf refuses to apologize to the platoon members for previously dismissing them as non-credible.\n\nGraphics by Townhall Graphic Designer Feven Amenu.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Friday Filibuster: The one-stop-shop for everything you need to know about this week in politics. .05/26/2016 9:53:43AM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "The Friday Filibuster: The one-stop-shop for everything you need to know about this week in politics.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - The Friday Filibuster: Cruzin' for the White House", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/03/27/the-friday-filibuster-cruzin-for-the-white-house-n1977187", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/3/27/7.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "The Friday Filibuster: The one-stop-shop for everything you need to know about this week in politics.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - The Friday Filibuster: Cruzin' for the White House", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/03/27/the-friday-filibuster-cruzin-for-the-white-house-n1977187", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/3/27/7.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "The Friday Filibuster: Cruzin' for the White House, Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4a96\"", "article_summary": "Meanwhile, the White House continues to believe we\u2019ve \u201csucceeded\u201d in Yemen even as its president fled rebels and al Qaeda took control of a key city.\nBoth Rubio and Walker said that if they became president they\u2019d immediately scrap Obama\u2019s Iran deal.\nMeanwhile in Washington, Senate Democrats continued to block a vote on legislation meant to stop human trafficking and help victims because of a provision that prevents public funds from paying for abortions.\nAbortion & Human TraffickingIn New York, a pro-abortion provision in a human trafficking bill, which held up its passage for years, has finally been severed, clearing the way for this important legislation to advance.\nThe Friday Filibuster: The one-stop-shop for everything you need to know about this week in politics."}
