I was aware of much of what Blackman writes, but the following was new to me:\n\nOn Meet the Press, Trump was asked whether he would rely on executive action in the manner of President Obama. \u201cI won\u2019t refuse it. I\u2019m going to do a lot of things,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cI mean, [President Obama] led the way, to be honest with you,\u201d he added. But rest assured, Trump noted, \u201cI\u2019m going to use [executive actions] much better and they\u2019re going to serve a much better purpose than he\u2019s done.\u201d\n\nSo after years of reveling in criticisms of Obama\u2019s constitutional neglect, including rather sober and well-documented criticisms (if I do so say myself), a plurality has nominated a man who doesn\u2019t even pretend for campaign purposes to respect the Constitution (say what you will about the current president, he certainly promised to respect the Constitution and the separation of powers during his first presidential campaign). This suggests that for a large part of the base, hostility to various unilateral actions by Obama was about dislike of Obama, not in defense of the rule of law. The constitutionalist vote went primarily to Ted Cruz (who wrote a very good introduction to my book), but that vote turned out to be rather small, judging not only by Trump\u2019s victory but also by the fact that Cruz emphasized other issues.\n\nMeanwhile, the Obama fans who have enabled the president\u2019s frequent disrespect for the Constitution and the rule of law, deflecting criticism with allegations of everything from lunacy to racism to \u201cdelegitimization\u201d are unlikely to be happy if and when President Trump (uggh!) engages in God-knows-what unilateral actions. When challenged, Trump will cite the Obama administration\u2019s actions regarding Obamacare, immigration and more as precedent. I\u2019ve consistently heard it argued that Obama had \u201cno choice\u201d but to go around the \u201cobstructionist\u201d Congress. So if Congress declines to go along with some of Trump\u2019s more, ahem, creative ideas, what argument will Democrats use against him?", "article_metadata": {"description": "A plurality has nominated a man who doesn't even pretend for campaign purposes to respect the Constitution.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A plurality has nominated a man who doesn't even pretend for campaign purposes to respect the Constitution.", "title": "Trump\u2019s threat to the Constitution", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/05/12/trumps-threat-to-the-constitution/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/04/12/Editorial-Opinion/Images/GOP_2016_Trump-0668b-e1463614626916.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/05/12/trumps-threat-to-the-constitution/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Post Keywords", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Post Keywords"}, "article_summary": "South Texas law professor (and my former constitutional law student) Josh Blackman has a very useful summary in National Review of Donald Trump\u2019s lack of respect for the Constitution and the threat this poses to the rule of law if he\u2019s elected.\n\u201cI mean, [President Obama] led the way, to be honest with you,\u201d he added.\nSo if Congress declines to go along with some of Trump\u2019s more, ahem, creative ideas, what argument will Democrats use against him?\nWhen challenged, Trump will cite the Obama administration\u2019s actions regarding Obamacare, immigration and more as precedent.\nI was aware of much of what Blackman writes, but the following was new to me:On Meet the Press, Trump was asked whether he would rely on executive action in the manner of President Obama."}
