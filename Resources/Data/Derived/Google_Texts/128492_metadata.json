Austrian forensic experts working with Mexican authorities made the identification.\n\nThe attorney general says the bone fragment was found among ashes and charred remains near a river and garbage dump where members of a drug gang allegedly killed the students and burned their bodies.\n\nAuthorities believe Iguala's mayor, Jose Luis Abarca, and his wife ordered police to round up the leftist students and turn them over to the drug gang.\n\nSo far, 80 people have been arrested, including the mayor and his wife and a number of police and gang members.\n\nThe grisly case has infuriated Mexicans who say they are sick of corruption by local officials. It also has shaken President Enrique Pena Nieto, whose government is accused of waiting too long to begin a federal investigation.\n\nSome of the parents of the missing students are demanding that the president resign.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Americas, Mexico, missing students", "Author": "Scott Stearns", "og": {"site_name": "VOA", "description": "Attorney general says fragment found near a garbage dump belongs to one of 43 students who disappeared in September", "title": "Mexican Official Confirms Bone Fragment Came From Missing Student", "url": "http://www.voanews.com/content/mexico-missing-students-bone-fragment/2549825.html", "image": "http://gdb.voanews.com/A9AE9AFB-1E76-4951-A36C-0AAFC866A051_cx0_cy9_cw0_mw1024_mh1024_s.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://gdb.voanews.com/A9AE9AFB-1E76-4951-A36C-0AAFC866A051_cx0_cy9_cw0_mw1024_mh1024_s.jpg", "site": "@voanews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Mexican Official Confirms Bone Fragment Came From Missing Student", "google-site-verification": "xhlpWO2mj7cS-CLSz4sliKEzNLqoRguHlaJnb1PFuBs", "keywords": "voa, voice of america, voanews, voanews,voianews, english news, voa special english, special english, voa\u5b98\u7f51, voanews.com, china, iran the voice of america, syria, \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441 \u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0438, \u7f8e\u56fd\u4e4b\u97f3", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/voiceofamerica"}, "abstract": "The Voice of America is one of the world's most trusted sources for news and information from the United States and around the world.
