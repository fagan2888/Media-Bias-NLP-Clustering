A nonprofit group that spent millions of dollars to support Sen. Mitch McConnell's 2014 re-election has paid for a statewide TV ad to criticize former Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear's efforts to save his health care reforms.

The 30-second ad from the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition is titled "Go Home" and says Beshear will not stop his "sad attempt to keep Obamacare."

As governor, Beshear used the federal Affordable Care Act to expand Kentucky's Medicaid program and create an exchange where people could purchase discounted private insurance plans. Republican Gov. Matt Bevin wants to repeal both programs because he says they are too expensive. He is developing his own plan for Medicaid.

Beshear started his own nonprofit group earlier this month that he said would educate voters about Bevin's health care policies.
