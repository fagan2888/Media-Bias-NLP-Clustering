So it is with President Barack Obama\u2019s seemingly straightforward request that consumers should be allowed to renew health insurance policies that their insurance companies canceled as the ACA required.\n\nTurns out, the president\u2019s request is not so straightforward at all.\n\nThat is why, a week later, many state officials and insurance carriers are still wringing their hands over whether to comply with Obama\u2019s request.\n\nAlready, there have been some paradoxes. Some states that have always been on board with the president\u2019s health reforms, such as Washington and New York, have declined the administration\u2019s request and will not allow renewals of insurance policies that do not meet ACA standards. Meanwhile, other states that have been resolutely opposed to the president all along, such as Mississippi and Oklahoma, were already allowing those renewals.\n\nHere is an explanation of the cancellation issue in Q and A form:\n\nWhat is the problem in the first place?\n\nThe ACA set minimum standards for all individual health insurance policies sold after Jan. 1, 2014, not just those sold on the insurance exchanges. For example, all policies must cover a defined set of services, such as maternal health care, mental health care and pediatric dental and vision care. Insurance carriers that offered policies that did not cover the required benefits or that placed dollar limits on coverage informed millions of policyholders that their existing policies would not be renewable into 2014. That was actually a choice the insurance carriers made themselves. The policies could have been renewed for a year, even if they didn\u2019t comply with the ACA and even if they remained in effect into 2014. Many insurance carriers simply decided they wouldn\u2019t renew them. Many consumers were surprised and upset about the cancellations because Obama had repeatedly said about the health law: \u201cIf you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan.\u201d\n\nUnder federal law, the carriers had to accompany the cancellations with an offer of replacement insurance. In many cases, premiums for those policies were much higher.\n\nHow many people have these individual health policies anyway?\n\nAccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation, about 15 million Americans are covered under individual plans.\n\nDoes the malfunctioning federal health care website have anything to do with it?\n\nThe troubled health exchanges made it difficult to impossible for consumers who got cancellation notices to find out how much they would have to pay for new coverage and whether they qualified for subsidies. That increased the pressure on the administration to allow consumers to keep their existing health plans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDid the president\u2019s request that states allow carriers to renew canceled policies solve the problem?\n\nNot by a long shot. For one thing, many insurance companies are in no mood to reissue old policies when they have gone through the trouble of devising new plans that are ACA compliant. For another, states are largely responsible for the regulation of insurance sold within their borders, so it\u2019s up to each state to decide if they want to comply with the president\u2019s request.\n\nIs there a red state-blue state divide over complying with the president\u2019s request?\n\nSomewhat, but not in the way you might think. Some very blue states, such as Washington, New York and Massachusetts, have said no to Obama. They aren\u2019t going to allow renewals of noncompliant policies because they say it could undermine the success of the ACA. But not all blue states are taking that position. Some GOP-led states, on the other hand, are saying yes to the president because they disapproved of the ACA and its regulation of insurance carriers in the first place. Most states are still undecided.\n\nWhy aren\u2019t all Democratic-leaning states rejecting Obama\u2019s proposal?\n\nExchange websites in some blue states are not working as well as in others. In Hawaii and Oregon, for example, the state-run sites are still not fully functioning. Those states reason that it\u2019s not fair to deny renewals when the people in their states can\u2019t see what their new policies would look like and how much they would cost.\n\nWhy are ACA supporters worried about Obama\u2019s decision?\n\nThey believe that the people most likely to be offered renewals of relatively cheap, noncomplying policies are young, healthy Americans. If those people do not participate in the health insurance exchanges, the concern is that the premiums charged to those who do enroll \u2014 older, and less healthy people \u2014 will be insufficient to support future claims. The result would be higher rates for everyone the following year. Other supporters, however, believe the number of people who will remain outside the exchanges because of the renewals will in the end be so small that it won\u2019t really affect rates.\n\nWhy are any GOP-leaning states agreeing to extend the policies?\n\nHere\u2019s where it gets interesting. Most of those states decided not to build their own insurance exchanges, relying instead on the federal website, which, as everyone knows, has been a mess. Some of those states \u2014 North Carolina and South Carolina, for example \u2014 have said they will allow the renewals for the same reasons Oregon and Hawaii are allowing them. Many others, however, are still talking with insurance carriers in their states and haven\u2019t reached a decision.\n\nBut there\u2019s another reason for some GOP states. Long before the cancellations bubbled up as an issue, a number of states, including Mississippi, Oklahoma, Iowa and Texas, encouraged carriers in their states to allow renewals and early renewals (for those policies that would have expired after Jan. 1) of existing policies for up to a year provided that the new terms began before the new year. By taking that step, those states essentially complied with the president\u2019s request before he made it while also keeping people off the exchanges. Other states, such as Rhode Island and Illinois, specifically prohibited early renewals, saying they violated the spirit of the ACA to provide affordable, comprehensive coverage to all.\n\nIs there a downside for people to renew these old policies?\n\nAs the Obama administration says, many of those old policies don\u2019t have the coverage or protections of the policies sold on the exchanges. They also won\u2019t be eligible for the subsidies that are available to many of those with low and moderate incomes who shop on the exchanges.\n\nHow big a deal is this really?\n\nSome health policy experts, such as Sabrina Corlette, project director at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University, have characterized the whole cancellation issue as a \u201cred herring.\u201d Federal law required insurance carriers who canceled policies to offer an alternative. In many cases, Corlette said, those alternatives were priced far higher than the original policies, and that\u2019s what fueled the uproar. Obama\u2019s assurances that people could keep their old insurance didn\u2019t help.\n\nSo, how many people are really affected negatively by all this?\n\nVery few, according to Families USA, a nonprofit organization that backs health reform. It issued a report Thursday, which said that just 1.6 million Americans under age 65 are both at risk of losing their individual policies and also ineligible for subsidies on the health exchanges.\n\nVisit Stateline for a list of each state\u2019s stance on policy renewals.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As even casual observers know at this point, the Affordable Care Act is complicated by a combination of partisan politics, hobbled government websites, misinformation and the byzantine practices of the insurance industry.
