Wagner, who was seven months pregnant, skidded off the road, crashed, and was paralyzed from the chest down.\n\nAmazingly, doctors were able to deliver Wagner\u2019s baby in healthy condition, but she would need extensive daily assistance. Wagner and her husband, Dave Campbell, who worked for a small manufacturer and earned $39,000 a year, have only been able to afford that assistance through Medi-Cal, the state version of Medicaid.\n\nMedi-Cal is a means-tested program, meaning it has restrictions on personal wealth: Essentially, recipients are subject to income limits, and may only have $3,150 in assets beyond a house and one vehicle. So Campbell and Wagner have to be comparatively poor to get health care: low income, no retirement savings, no college savings for their child.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge hole, and it\u2019s one that people don\u2019t know about,\u201d says Andrea Campbell, a professor of political science at MIT and an expert in social policy.\n\nCampbell now knows about this hole from personal experience: She is the sister of Dave Campbell, and has spent much of the last two years trying to help her family obtain the best care possible. She has also been trying to bring attention to the plight of Americans who, while appreciative of social programs intended to support people in need, suffer from some of their strictures \u2014 especially those who are in need of \u201clong-term support and services,\u201d as the disability community calls it.\n\nTwo months after Wagner\u2019s accident, Campbell wrote an op-ed in The New York Times critiquing the inconsistencies of the country\u2019s social-policy programs and calling for the implementation of the federal government\u2019s Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was then under judicial review. Two months after that op-ed appeared, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the ACA \u2014 and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg cited Campbell\u2019s piece in her concurring opinion.\n\n\u201cI had no expectation of that at all,\u201d Campbell says. \u201cThat was incredible.\u201d\n\nNow Campbell has written a book on her family\u2019s experience, \u201cTrapped in America\u2019s Safety Net: One Family\u2019s Struggle,\u201d published this month by the University of Chicago Press. In it, she details how her family now contends with daily life while facing financial restrictions healthy people do not have.\n\n\u201cThere is a safety net, and I hope we do not come off as ungrateful in this book,\u201d Campbell says. Still, she adds, \u201cIn many ways these programs just thwart people\u2019s efforts to better their lot.\u201d\n\nDoes means-testing justify its ends?\n\nTo see how means-testing imposes practical restrictions on people, consider Medi-Cal\u2019s requirement that Dave Campbell and Marcella Wagner can exempt only one vehicle from their asset limit. Wagner needs a wheelchair-accessible van at her home, but since her husband has to drive to work, the couple needs a second car. However, because this vehicle counts toward the $3,150 limit on assets, Dave Campbell now commutes in a 1968 Datsun pickup worth a couple of hundred dollars \u2014 which Andrea Campbell, wary of auto safety following her sister-in-law\u2019s accident, calls \u201cnot dependable.\u201d\n\nOr take college savings: Medi-Cal does not let recipients invest in the popular \u201c529\u201d college plans that let families set aside money for higher education. And unexpected expenses \u2014 such as repairs to a car or home \u2014 become harder to manage if people are not allowed to save.\n\n\u201cEvery little thing is a crisis, because you have so little in assets,\u201d Campbell says.\n\nTo be sure, means-testing is not uniform across the 50 states. The welfare program Temporary Assistance for Needy Families has a maximum benefit ranging from a high of less than half the poverty level, in New York state, to a low of $2,040 a year for a family of three in Mississippi \u2014 roughly 11 percent of the federal poverty level, or a bit more than the annual household income in Nigeria.\n\nYet the single biggest flaw with means-testing, in Campbell\u2019s view, is that the income limits and other restrictions can make it harder for people to break free of social insurance programs.\n\n\u201cWork has a high cost, because as you start earning income, you lose eligibility for programs,\u201d Campbell says, noting that for everyone without a remarkable long-term care insurance policy, long-term services and support are \u201cextraordinarily expensive, beyond [their] means.\u201d\n\nTo change that dynamic, Campbell thinks we should either raise the asset threshold or drop means-testing. The ACA does not use an asset test, which is one reason she advocated for it in The New York Times. On the other hand, the ACA does not apply retroactively to Campbell\u2019s family.\n\nPervasive and precarious\n\nThe fact that the ACA does not apply to Wagner\u2019s situation points to another problem with many social insurance programs, Campbell says: They consist of incremental layers added by legislatures \u2014 usually with good intentions, but with the consequence of confusing even case workers, since different layers apply to different people.\n\n\u201cThe complexity comes from having all these different programs added,\u201d Campbell says. Her family is still trying to determine exactly what income level Dave Campbell could legally reach without costing his wife her health care.\n\nMeanwhile, the necessity of complying with a mountain of requirements weighs on those requiring assistance. For her brother and sister-in-law, Campbell says, \u201cI think their main emotion is almost fear [of] losing eligibility for this crucial program.\u201d\n\nStill, Campbell jokes wryly, there is at least one upside. \u201cAs my sister-in-law said, \u2018In the media you hear all these stories about fraud. But I don\u2019t know how anyone does fraud, because it takes all your energy just to figure out how to do things right.\u2019\u201d\n\nOther scholars have praised \u201cTrapped in America\u2019s Safety Net.\u201d Deborah Stone, a professor of government at Dartmouth College, calls it \u201ca remarkable, astonishing book, at once a comprehensive reference on the American social welfare system and an engaging narrative account of how social assistance programs shape real people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nAs far as public discussion of the subject goes, Campbell readily acknowledges that long-term disabilities are fairly rare and that readers may not know anyone in her family\u2019s situation. But using a means-tested social-policy program is not rare: Two-thirds of Americans live in a household where someone will enroll in a means-tested program between ages 18 and 64.\n\n\u201cThese are programs that touch most American families, so all of us have a stake in their being better-designed,\u201d Campbell says.\n\nAnd many of us are just a swerve on the freeway away from the same situation, she concludes: \u201cI hope part of this conversation is about the precariousness of the middle class, because it is striking how many people have low incomes, very little in savings, and live month to month.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new book from MIT political scientist Andrea Campbell gives a firsthand perspective on the merits of means-tested social insurance programs.", "og": {"site_name": "MIT News", "description": "Andrea Campbell gives a firsthand perspective on the effects of means-tested social insurance programs.", "title": "Caught in the social safety net", "url": "http://news.mit.edu/2014/andrea-campbell-book-social-insurance-1002", "image": "http://news.mit.edu/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/files/styles/og/public/images/2014/MIT-Safety-Net-Campbell-01_0.jpg", "author": "Peter Dizikes | MIT News Office", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": {"identifier": "@mit", "id": 15460048}, "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"page_id": 126533127390327}, "keywords": "health care, safety net, social insurance, Medicaid, means testing, Affordable Care Act, Andrea Campbell, MIT political science, MIT humanities, MIT", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "health care, safety net, social insurance, Medicaid, means testing, Affordable Care Act, Andrea Campbell, MIT political science, MIT humanities, MIT"}, "article_summary": "The ACA does not use an asset test, which is one reason she advocated for it in The New York Times.\n\u201cThere is a safety net, and I hope we do not come off as ungrateful in this book,\u201d Campbell says.\nOn the other hand, the ACA does not apply retroactively to Campbell\u2019s family.\nHer family is still trying to determine exactly what income level Dave Campbell could legally reach without costing his wife her health care.\n\u201cThat was incredible.\u201dNow Campbell has written a book on her family\u2019s experience, \u201cTrapped in America\u2019s Safety Net: One Family\u2019s Struggle,\u201d published this month by the University of Chicago Press."}
