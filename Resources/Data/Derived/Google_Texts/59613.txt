PUEBLO, Colo. -

Pueblo Police are asking for tips about a woman who they say pretended to be someone else to steal prescription medication.

Police began investigation on March 8, 2016 after a woman went to pick up her prescription at the Walgreens in the 1500 block of W. 4th Street. It turns out another woman had picked up the medication three days prior.

Police say the imposter knew the victim's name and information, which is how she was able to get the drugs.
