Jeanne Shaheen (D) on Thursday night by characterizing the Affordable Care Act as a law that undermines American \u201cliberty\u201d and freedom of choice. The former Massachusetts senator won\u2019t mention that his family has benefited from Obamacare or that he voted for very similar health care mandates and requirements as a state senator in Massachusetts, however.\n\n\u201cPremiums are way up for a lot of people \u2013 by 90 percent, according to one survey,\u201d Brown will say, according to excerpts released by his campaign. \u201cAnd along with our money and our health plans, for a lot of us it feels like we\u2019re losing our liberty, too. Obamacare forces us to make a choice, live free or log on \u2013 and here in New Hampshire, we choose freedom.\u201d\n\nBrown rode a Tea Party wave to the senate in January of 2010 by promising to become the 41st vote to block Obamacare. But soon after it became law, he acknowledged relying on one of its provisions to \u201ckeep his elder daughter on his congressional health insurance plan.\u201d \u201cOf course I do,\u2019\u2019 the Massachusetts Republican told the Boston Globe in May of 2010, when asked if 23-year-old Ayla Brown has taken advantage of the provision. He argued that keeping his daughter on his health care plan \u201cis not inconsistent with his criticism of the federal law\u2026because the same coverage could be required by individual states.\u201d\n\nIndeed, as a Massachusetts state senator, Brown voted for the state\u2019s 2006\u2032s reform law, which provided the template for the Affordable Care Act, and similarly extended dependent coverage. The Massachusetts reform, commonly known as Chapter 58, also includes an individual health insurance mandate, employer responsibility provisions, insurance exchanges, government affordability credits and strict insurance regulations. Brown praised the state law during his 2010 senate campaign, asking during one debate, \u201c[W]hy do we need a one size fits all government approach we already did it?\u201d he asked. \u201c[W]hy would we go and subsidize the failure of other states \u2013 not only would we be paying for our plan, we\u2019d be paying for everyone else.\u201d\n\nAn Associated Press report previewing Brown\u2019s kickoff campaign event characterizes his claim that health care premiums will increase by 90 percent as dishonest. The statistic is based on a survey that included \u201ca single New Hampshire broker\u201d and \u201crefers only to the premium increase for individual policy holders.\u201d \u201cLess than 7 percent of New Hampshire\u2019s insured have individual plans; the vast majority of insured residents are covered by their employers,\u201d the AP writes.\n\nBrown\u2019s early interactions with voters also indicate that his anti-Obamacare rhetoric may not be gaining traction in New Hampshire, where approximately 22,000 people have signed up for health insurance through the law. A couple told Brown in March that the law was a \u201cfinancial lifesaver.\u201d \u201cThank God for Obamacare!\u201d the wife of Herb Richardson, a beneficiary of the ACA, exclaimed.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"or a lot of us it feels like we're losing our liberty,\" Brown says.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"[F]or a lot of us it feels like we're losing our liberty,\" Brown says.", "title": "What Scott Brown Won\u2019t Talk About While He\u2019s Attacking Obamacare", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/04/10/3425115/after-personally-benefiting-from-obamacare-scott-brown-claims-it-undermines-liberty/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/0512_scott-brown-630x429-11.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"[F]or a lot of us it feels like we're losing our liberty,\" Brown says.", "creator": "@@igorvolsky", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/0512_scott-brown-630x429-11-321x214.jpg", "title": "What Scott Brown Won\u2019t Talk About While He\u2019s Attacking Obamacare", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/0512_scott-brown-630x429-11.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/0512_scott-brown-630x429-11.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-10T09:03:24+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ivolsky"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce269\"", "article_summary": "Health What Scott Brown Won\u2019t Talk About While He\u2019s Attacking Obamacare CREDIT:CREDIT: APScott Brown will formally kickoff his campaign to unseat New Hampshire Sen.
