Rescuers were trying to reach people trapped in their basements, he said. One hospital in Peoria was treating 37 patients with injuries.\n\nMore than 60 tornadoes had been reported throughout the region as of 5:10 p.m. Sunday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nAs a tornado neared his home, Khoury prayed and recorded a video of the dark twister churning toward him.\n\n\u201cThe tornado happened in my backyard, and you can hear people screaming,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s iReport. \u201cWe were freaking out.\u201d\n\nWhile his house survived the storm, Khoury said others in the neighborhood weren\u2019t as lucky.\n\nVideo from CNN affiliate WMBD showed one Washington neighborhood where a tornado smashed cars and houses, littering the ground with broken wood beams and flinging furniture and debris onto lawns, sidewalks and streets.\n\n\u201cI grabbed my daughter and ran,\u201d one storm survivor told WMBD.\n\nIn nearby Peoria, Mayor Jim Ardis said his city was planning to send aid to help storm recovery in Washington, where a tornado hit what he described as a \u201cvery densely populated area.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just absolutely unbelievable,\u201d he said.\n\nJack Lance, who lives in Pekin, said he saw a lot of wreckage in his town.\n\n\u201cWe saw trees down, houses with their roofs completely torn off. I saw a lot of people in distress with their homes destroyed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a pretty sight.\u201d\n\nOfficials delayed the NFL game between the Chicago Bears and Baltimore Ravens for nearly two hours as storms approached Chicago, warning spectators to leave the stands at Soldier Field and head for covered areas.\n\n\u201cThe rain started coming, the skies got black, the wind was insane, and they evacuated us to underneath the concrete concourse,\u201d said Jim Arnold, who was at the game with his 11-year-old daughter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been through 15-degree-below weather and winds, but never anything like this,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cThe winds gusted at 70 mph, and the winds and the rain were horizontal and everybody was running. It was just crazy.\u201d\n\nFans returned to their seats and the game resumed mid-afternoon after the storm passed.\n\nBut other parts of the region still faced the threat of more severe weather, forecasters warned.\n\n\u201cThese storms having been moving so fast today, it\u2019s been hard to keep up,\u201d said storm chaser Tony Laubach, who spoke to CNN as he watched a tornado touch down outside Lebanon, Indiana.\n\nIn Illinois, two deaths were reported in Nashville; one in Washington; one near Brookport; and one near Unionville, according to officials.\n\nMonken said there were at least 11 confirmed tornado touchdowns, and officials there expect the number of storm-related injuries to grow.\n\nIn Oak Lawn, a wind gust of 86 mph was recorded as a severe thunderstorm rolled through the area.\n\nAt least six trucks overturned on highways about 80 miles west of Chicago due to high winds, the Ogle County Sheriff\u2019s Office said.\n\nIn a Twitter post, Indiana State Police shared a photo of twisted metal, piles of debris and the shell of a school building.\n\nMany people are without power across the state, police said.\n\nStorms damaged a mall and a bank and collapsed the roof of a fire station in Kokomo, Indiana, said Larry Smith, emergency management director in Howard County.\n\nSome houses had their roofs torn off when a tornado hit the area, he said.\n\nOfficials in Kokomo declared a state of emergency and closed schools for Monday, according to the city\u2019s Twitter account.\n\nThis is a particularly dangerous situation, the National Weather Service said in a bulletin released Sunday morning.\n\nAnd a tweet from the weather service in northern Indiana was even more ominous: \u201cThe worst decision you could make today is to ignore a severe/tornado warning. These storms will be nasty.\u201d\n\nA tornado watch means that weather conditions exist that can produce tornadoes and severe thunderstorms. Conditions are favorable for long-tracked, significant tornadoes across this watch area, the Storm Prediction Center said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Severe weather erupted throughout the Midwest with tornadoes tearing through several cities and a storm forcing fans to evacuate the stands during an NFL game.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "93c0125b6e5dd793b0f306c174977ff3"}, "og": {"site_name": "WQAD.com", "description": "Severe weather erupted throughout the Midwest with tornadoes tearing through several cities and a storm forcing fans to evacuate the stands during an NFL game.", "title": "Midwest tornadoes, winds slam towns and trucks; 5 killed in Illinois", "url": "http://wqad.com/2013/11/17/midwest-tornadoes-winds-slam-towns-and-trucks-2-killed-in-illinois/", "image": {"width": 350, "identifier": "https://localtvwqad.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/map1.jpg", "height": 238}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://localtvwqad.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/map1.jpg?w=240", "site": "@mytwitterhandle", "card": "summary", "creator": "@mytwitterhandle"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=339570924", "fb": {"pages": 32869603490}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wqad.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2882036417f6cd8ccaa6f6a7d2c6eaae?s=16", "application-name": "WQAD.com", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/wqad8", "published_time": "2013-11-17T22:27:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-18T02:33:56+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/wqad8"}, "keywords": "news, weather, illinois, pekin, tornado, washington county, washington tornado", "google-site-verification": "oCyrEMhIYdAYe44exrSiY6lwtVx417KNhwh2t4d9nwM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2d65\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt was complete destruction,\u201d said Anthony Khoury, who lives in Washington, Illinois.\n\u201cThere are people in the streets crying.\u201dAt least five people died in Illinois as a result of the severe storms, officials said.\nBut other parts of the region still faced the threat of more severe weather, forecasters warned.\nThese storms will be nasty.\u201dA tornado watch means that weather conditions exist that can produce tornadoes and severe thunderstorms.\n(CNN) \u2014 Severe weather erupted throughout the Midwest on Sunday afternoon, with tornadoes tearing through several cities and a storm forcing fans to evacuate the stands during an NFL game."}
