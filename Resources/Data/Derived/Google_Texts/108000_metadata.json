He\u2019s also doing his part to help fix a growing national shortage of primary-care physicians, which is expected to approach 52,000 by 2025, hitting rural regions and Indian reservations the hardest.\n\nExperts say the national shortage is fueled by more doctor retirements, an aging and more rapidly growing population and more people having health insurance. Many worry that if the government doesn\u2019t intervene, too many low-income Americans will be locked out of the U.S. health-care system.\n\n\u201cIf you call up and you can\u2019t get an appointment because there aren\u2019t any primary-care physicians, you\u2019re not getting access to health care,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state.\n\n\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0\n\nRhyner owes his job to Congress, which four years ago included $230 million in the Affordable Care Act to pay for training 550 graduate residents in 24 states.\n\nWith that funding set to expire next year, Murray wants Congress to spend $495 million more to keep the training going until 2019.\n\nMurray, the head of the Senate Budget Committee and a veteran Senate appropriator, said her home state is expected to be nearly 1,700 doctors short by 2030.\n\nShe called the Puyallup tribe in western Washington state \u201ca prime example\u201d of a community that needs government help.\n\n\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0\n\nWhen the tribe created its residency program for medical school graduates three years ago, it had only two medical residents, including Rhyner.\n\nThis year the tribe is training 10 doctors, using $1.5 million in federal grant money. Its facility opened as the first osteopathic family medicine residency in the country with a Native American focus. Now there are two, with Oklahoma\u2019s Choctaw Nation running a similar program. In Washington state, federal officials this year also paid for training programs in Yakima, Spokane and Top*****h.\n\nNationwide, 60 graduate programs are operating in two dozen states this year, including California, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Texas.\n\n\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0\n\nAlan Shelton, clinical director for the Puyallup Tribal Health Authority, said most doctors are trained in big hospitals and are uncomfortable with the prospect of working on a reservation. As a result, he said, most tribes have a hard time recruiting doctors.\n\n\u201cGenerally, the pay is less and the work might be more difficult. So you have to find somebody with a big heart,\u201d Shelton said.\n\nShelton said he looks for young doctors willing to forgo big-city salaries. He wants residents who appreciate \u201cthe benefits and the beauty\u201d of working in smaller communities and who want to make a personal connection with patients.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to just train technicians, we want to train healers,\u201d Shelton said. \u201cAnd the way we train healers is we connect them to the Native American community and they learn about ideas of wellness and spirituality. And when they connect with patients, they connect with them on a deep level.\u201d\n\nRhyner fit the job description, with Shelton calling him a doctor who\u2019s \u201creally committed to taking care of people that have limited options.\u201d\n\n\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0\n\nRhyner said most of his medical school classmates at Pacific Northwest University wanted to work in specialty fields that pay more, but he wanted to focus on family medicine and \u201cget a chance to do everything.\u201d\n\nHe grew up in Alaska but traveled extensively. He said he liked the idea of working on a reservation and joining a startup residency program he could help shape.\n\n\u201cI have kind of an eclectic background in the sense that my mom is from Pakistan and my dad is from Minnesota,\u201d Rhyner said. \u201cSo I\u2019ve lived all over the world. \u2026 I\u2019ve experienced Third World countries and areas where they don\u2019t have an opportunity to get access to good health care. It makes such a huge difference when we are there and we can help them.\u201d\n\nWhen he came to the reservation, Rhyner said, he wanted to \u201cexperience the community.\u201d He has done just that, attending powwows, and participating in sweat-lodge ceremonies.\n\n\u201cI see my patients there, and they see me, and it creates such a better connection that I really understand what they\u2019re going through and what their life is like,\u201d Rhyner said. \u201cEverybody knows everybody.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON | After two years as a medical school resident for the Puyallup Tribe of Indians, Aaron Rhyner sees 14 patients a day, works 50 to 80 hours a week and earns roughly $50,000 a year.Rhyner, 29, of Tacoma, Wash., calls his work \u201csomething special,\u201d a chance to make a difference.
