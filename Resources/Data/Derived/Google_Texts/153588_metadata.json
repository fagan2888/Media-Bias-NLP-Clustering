Of course, many were fairy tales, whether masquerading as truth, pseudo-truth (\u201cbased on a true story\u201d) or otherwise.\n\nThe challenge in making a theatrical- release film that truly captures baseball today is that it would have to run 3 hours and 2 minutes. That\u2019s horrifying to theater operators, studios and much of the potential audience.\n\nThat was the average length of a major-league game in 2014.\n\nAn average MLB game is not \u201cThe Right Stuff\u201d (3:13), \u201cThe Godfather: Part II\u201d (3:20) or \u201cThe Deer Hunter\u201d (3:02), terrific films that probably left much on the cutting-room floor.\n\nAn average MLB game of this era is \u2014 and this is being nice \u2014 a decent, yet bloated film running 3:02, leaving you fidgeting and spotting the obvious spots for cuts. Plus, the problem with using \u201caverage\u201d is that many games ran longer, much longer \u2014 and don\u2019t tell me that shorter games mitigated the aggravation. They didn\u2019t.\n\nAfter an offseason of study and more radical experimentation in the Arizona Fall League, MLB\u2019s Friday announcement of modest measures to address the issue already has some players whining. It\u2019s as if they\u2019re incredulously asking: What problem?\n\nBrace for more outrage from those who wax melodic about the beauty of the absence of a time clock in baseball, about its natural rhythms. These are the same folks \u2014 many from my generation \u2014 who routinely overintellectualize and romanticize the game, actually insulting it by not allowing it to be what it truly is.\n\nIt is a terrific game diminished, not enhanced, by the increasingly languid pace. The running time is just part of the problem. If a game, played at a reasonable pace, goes \u201clong\u201d as an outgrowth of what happens as it is being played, fair enough. But too much of the lengthening of the games is the result of the gradual acceptance of contrived, avoidable delays. Of preening. Of gamesmanship. And even of the nonenforcement of existing rules involving the pace of the game. It all has been allowed into the game\u2019s culture, because baseball permitted it.\n\nThankfully for Coloradans, one of the measures MLB will try is that hitters generally must keep one foot in the batter\u2019s box between pitches.\n\nTroy Tulowitzki is a great player, but his at-bats are tortuous to watch \u2026 granted, until the payoff for one of the best hitters in the game. Step out. Unstrap, restrap the batting gloves. Play with the helmet. On alternating pitches, either recite James Earl Jones\u2019 \u201cField of Dreams\u201d soliloquy or hum a verse of John Fogerty\u2019s \u201cCenterfield.\u201d (OK, I made that up. But it just seems like it.) And then step back in.\n\nTulo is far from alone in his approach, but he\u2019s the worst transgressor.\n\nJosh Beckett was his pitching equivalent, and watching a Beckett vs. Jorge De La Rosa matchup at Dodger Stadium meant most Los Angeles fans would be back on the 101 Freeway by the fourth inning.\n\nGranted, some modern realities make inevitable longer games than in the days of yore. Those include more pitching changes and video review, a positive step if allowed to be tweaked along the way. Breaks after every half inning are jammed with revenue enhancers.\n\nThe use of a clock to monitor pitching changes and those between-inning breaks will horrify purists, I suppose, but imagine if the 20-second pitch clock used in the Arizona Fall League had been implemented too. (A clock! In baseball!) Yet if these three modest measures help at all directly, and just as important, chip away at the mind-set that made them necessary, it\u2019s a significant step forward for the game.\n\nNine innings don\u2019t have to be an epic.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Frei: MLB games don\u2019t have to last as long as the Oscars", "title": "Frei: MLB games don\u2019t have to last as long as the Oscars", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/22/frei-mlb-games-dont-have-to-last-as-long-as-the-oscars/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-22T21:44:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T23:10:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "An average MLB game is not \u201cThe Right Stuff\u201d (3:13), \u201cThe Godfather: Part II\u201d (3:20) or \u201cThe Deer Hunter\u201d (3:02), terrific films that probably left much on the cutting-room floor.\nAn average MLB game of this era is \u2014 and this is being nice \u2014 a decent, yet bloated film running 3:02, leaving you fidgeting and spotting the obvious spots for cuts.\nThankfully for Coloradans, one of the measures MLB will try is that hitters generally must keep one foot in the batter\u2019s box between pitches.\nPlus, the problem with using \u201caverage\u201d is that many games ran longer, much longer \u2014 and don\u2019t tell me that shorter games mitigated the aggravation.\nBut too much of the lengthening of the games is the result of the gradual acceptance of contrived, avoidable delays."}
