A shutdown seems unlikely after the announced resignation of House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio; however, a final budget deal -- either short-term or long-term -- has not been agreed to in the nation's capital.\n\nTwo years ago, the federal government was shut down over a disagreement between Democrats and Republicans on whether or not to fund the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's signature health care legislation, which extended health insurance benefits to millions.
