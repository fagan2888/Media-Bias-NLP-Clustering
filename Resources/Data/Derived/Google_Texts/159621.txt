Hundreds shuffled from store to store Thursday for the after Christmas sales at Silver Sands Premium Outlets.

Some shoppers are there just for the sales, while others are there to spend their gift cards.

"We have a ton of holiday gift cards for the season, so many are coming in to get those gifts and use those gift cards,from not only our merchants but we also sell our Simon gift cards here,” said Katie Johnson, of Silver Sands Premium Outlets.

And for shopper Kerrie Henderson she is here for another reason.

"Something Santa didn't leave me under the tree. Thatt is what I was really looking for,” said Henderson.

Large crowds of people hitting the stores the day after Christmas are nothing new.

The biggest reason, many stores have a majority of their items between 50 to 70 percent off.

"Our stores have some great deals on top of the already 25 to 60 percent off every day,” said Johnson.

"We normally do not go shopping the day after Christmas in Indianapolis, but since we are here and we have a great outlet mall, we decided to come and check out what you all have and see what kind of sales we could find,” stated Henderson.

Major retailers like Macy's, Walmart and Target also offered 70 percent off many of their items Thursday.
