And they want what all of us want from our employers: some job security, decent pay and benefits, opportunities for advancement, and above all else, respect,\u201d said Tony Frank at the Fall Address.\n\nUnder the provisions of the Affordable Care Act, the average income of an adjunct has fallen to $2,700 per course, less than $25,000 per year. According to President Maria Maisto of New Faculty Majority, who spoke at CSU regarding higher education equity, this is to prevent colleges and universities from having to provide benefits.\n\n\u201cSince last October, adjunct faculty have seen their course loads cut or their work redefined so that colleges and universities can avoid providing the majority them with health benefits under the provisions of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d stated Maisto in an email. \u201cIt is now below poverty level and adjuncts still receive no health benefits.\u201d\n\nAccording to Dan Bush, vice president for Faculty Affairs, CSU currently employs 1,600 faculty: 1,000 of which are tenure track with the remaining 600 adjuncts.\n\n\u201cFor most (adjuncts), they teach quite a few classes and it is a fairly substantial income that they can absolutely live off of and then its a career path,\u201d Bush said.\n\nThere seems to be a discrepancy between where the university is with treating adjunct faculty and where they think they are.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s frustrating is that this semester we needed a new adjunct person and they wouldn\u2019t let me have another class even though I have experience, but they were willing to hire a new person that had never taught before because they said I couldn\u2019t make anymore money,\u201d said Pam Bishop, key advisor and adjunct faculty for the School of Social Work.\n\nStudents pay the same tuition for classes taught by tenure-track faculty as they do for classes taught by non-tenure track full and part-time faculty.\n\nAdjunct faculty Dr. John Gandy, distinguished professor emeritus, believes that they are not appreciated and taken for granted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got real issues with how adjuncts are treated here. It really is disturbing. Again, I\u2019ve been doing this for forty-four years, I\u2019ve never worked in a place where adjuncts are treated so poorly,\u201d Gandy said. \u201cThey\u2019re so focused on research that I think people are really lost in ways of the importance of teaching, the importance of being in the classroom, the importance of students. Thats what most adjuncts do is classroom teaching and I\u2019m just not sure thats priority anymore. But I agree with the president, he\u2019s exactly right and I think its wonderful its just I\u2019ve heard it before.\u201d\n\nNew legislature has given CSU the power to allow contracts between adjunct faculty as well as Senior Teaching Appointments, which recognizes outstanding teachers.\n\n\u201cThe picture I am trying to paint is that there\u2019s a broad spectrum of how adjuncts fit into the mission of the university and there are many of them that are full-time and we are trying to do our to make it a career path where they have stability and funding and the expectations for teaching and there are some unique situations where people might only be hired for one class or maybe two without the expectation that they\u2019ll be hired again in the future,\u201d Bush said.\n\nBoth Gandy and Bishop agree with Frank\u2019s mission, but are skeptical of tangible change.\n\n\u201cI feel like he\u2019s doing his best to deliver the promises but its not always in his hands because if he says he wants to do this there are so many layers: provosts and deans,\u201d Bishop said.\n\n\u201cThey (adjuncts) love to teach and they love students, but they\u2019re not treated well,\u201d Gandy said.\n\nCollegian Reporter Cassandra Whelihan can be reached at news@collegian.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The times are changing for adjunct faculty at CSU.\r\n\r\n\u201cLike all universities, Colorado State is fortunate to have an exceptional cadre of adjunct faculty \u2013 highly qualified women and men who bring a wealth of insight and experience to our classrooms, and allow us to provide the courses and curri", "author": "Cassandra Whelihan", "og": {"site_name": "Rocky Mountain Collegian", "description": "The times are changing for adjunct faculty at CSU.\r\n\r\n\u201cLike all universities, Colorado State is fortunate to have an exceptional cadre of adjunct faculty \u2013 highly qualified women and men who bring a wealth of insight and experience to our classrooms, and allow us to provide the courses and curri", "title": "Adjunct faculty see changes at CSU", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 450, "identifier": "http://www.collegian.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/092512_adjunct2-EMc.jpg", "height": 243}, "updated_time": "2013-10-15T12:47:37+00:00", "url": "http://www.collegian.com/2013/10/adjunct-faculty-see-changes-at-csu/47509/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The times are changing for adjunct faculty at CSU.\r\n\r\n\u201cLike all universities, Colorado State is fortunate to have an exceptional cadre of adjunct faculty \u2013 highly qualified women and men who bring a wealth of insight and experience to our classrooms, and allow us to provide the courses and curri", "creator": "@CSUCollegian", "url": "http://www.collegian.com/2013/10/adjunct-faculty-see-changes-at-csu/47509/", "image": "http://www.collegian.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/092512_adjunct2-EMc.jpg", "title": "Adjunct faculty see changes at CSU", "site": "@CSUCollegian", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CSUCollegian", "section": "News", "published_time": "2013-10-15T12:47:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-15T12:47:37+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The times are changing for adjunct faculty at CSU.\nThere seems to be a discrepancy between where the university is with treating adjunct faculty and where they think they are.\nAdjunct faculty Dr. John Gandy, distinguished professor emeritus, believes that they are not appreciated and taken for granted.\nStudents pay the same tuition for classes taught by tenure-track faculty as they do for classes taught by non-tenure track full and part-time faculty.\nAgain, I\u2019ve been doing this for forty-four years, I\u2019ve never worked in a place where adjuncts are treated so poorly,\u201d Gandy said."}
