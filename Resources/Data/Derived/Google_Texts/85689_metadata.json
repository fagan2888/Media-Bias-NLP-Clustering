It includes, for example, Trump saying at one point that he\u2019d replace ObamaCare with something \u201cmuch better,\u201d and later saying he\u2019d replace it with something \u201cterrific,\u201d as though those are two different things.\n\nTrump has, however, said a lot of things over the past two months that are hard to square. Fahrenthold adds up seven different iterations of Trump\u2019s views on tax reform, for example, from backing a national sales tax, to supporting a flat tax, to leaving the system more or less alone.\n\nEven Sean Hannity, who clearly likes Trump, was confused about his position on tax reform. Here\u2019s an exchange from his interview with Trump, which aired Aug. 12.\n\n\u201cHANNITY: Let me go to specifics on the economy. You want to lower the tax. You want to implement a flat tax.\n\nTRUMP: No, no.\n\nHANNITY: You don\u2019t? I thought you liked the flat tax. I read it in a couple interviews.\n\nTRUMP: The problem with the flat tax is it\u2019s sort of the same. I actually believe that people, as they make more and more money, can pay a higher percentage, OK?\u201d\n\nThis has been too much for some conservatives, such as National Review\u2019s Charles Cooke, who complained about Trump\u2019s flip flopping on Hannity\u2019s show. \u201cHe said on this show\u2026 that he was fine with the progressive income tax. \u2026 The day before, he suggested he was in favor of a flat tax. Literally 24 hours before. He\u2019s making it up as he goes along, and we are all falling it for some reason.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible that this is simply a reflection of Trump\u2019s brazen style. He likes to sound bold and decisive, even if he doesn\u2019t have the particulars worked out yet. But if Trump has such a thin grasp on key issues like tax reform, it does raise legitimate questions about just what it is he\u2019d do if elected president.\n\nAs Trump starts releasing details about his plans, it will be far more difficult for him to wing it without looking incredibly fickle. Or worse, looking like a typical politician who\u2019ll say anything to get elected.\n\nFollow John Merline on Twitter: @IBD_JMerline.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Everyone knows the quote from Mark Twain: \"If you don't like the weather in New England, just wait a few minutes.\" And most people know that Trump has changed", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Everyone knows the quote from Mark Twain: \u201cIf you don\u2019t like the weather in New England, just wait a few minutes.\u201d And most people know that Trump has changed his views on various\u2026", "title": "Donald Trump\u2019s Views Are Starting to Resemble The Weather In New England", "url": "http://www.investors.com/politics/commentary/donald-trump-changes-his-mind-on-issues/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7.png", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@IBDInvestors"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7-270x270.png", "date": "2015-08-18 14:16:00:-08:00", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-18T14:16:00+00:00", "modified_time": "-001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It includes, for example, Trump saying at one point that he\u2019d replace ObamaCare with something \u201cmuch better,\u201d and later saying he\u2019d replace it with something \u201cterrific,\u201d as though those are two different things.\nFahrenthold adds up seven different iterations of Trump\u2019s views on tax reform, for example, from backing a national sales tax, to supporting a flat tax, to leaving the system more or less alone.\n\u2026 The day before, he suggested he was in favor of a flat tax.\nEven Sean Hannity, who clearly likes Trump, was confused about his position on tax reform.\nYou want to implement a flat tax."}
