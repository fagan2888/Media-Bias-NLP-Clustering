Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), tried to tie his unexpected death Oct. 24 after he suffered a heart attack to glitches the couple experienced with Obamacare. He was 65, and died at home while sleeping.\n\nIt was a moving moment that captivated many observers as well as members of the right-wing media who watched it on TV, but it simply wasn\u2019t true. Obamacare \u2014 the Affordable Care Act \u2014 didn\u2019t play any role in Al\u2019s death.\n\nI know that Cynthia hates Obamacare and everything she believes the law stands for, since like other House Republicans she has voted more than 50 times to repeal it. But what the law has accomplished is to bring health care insurance to millions of poor Americans, and I\u2019m pretty sure Al wouldn\u2019t want his death to be used as a reason to take that help away from his countrymen.\n\nAl\u2019s career as a state legislator, his law career and efforts to preserve historic buildings, while also developing Cheyenne, are well documented. What most people don\u2019t know is that once Al got to know you, he was a friend for life. He was a compassionate man who truly cared about people. Whenever something important happened in a friend\u2019s life, be it a happy or sad event, Al took the time to congratulate them or offer some comfort.\n\nHe knew most journalists are terrible at clipping news articles about themselves or their families, so a few days after my mother died several years ago, Al sent me a letter. Inside was a copy of my mother\u2019s obituary notice from the newspaper I worked for at the time, along with an understanding note with memories of his own mother, and sympathy for my family\u2019s loss. It was much appreciated.\n\nFor many years we were part of an informal group that went to a different restaurant for lunch every Wednesday in Cheyenne, and we talked about politics, sports, our jobs, our families. We never managed to solve the world\u2019s problems, but we did share our own with our friends, and it always seemed to help.\n\nAl always had the best ideas and advice, and he was a leader. We held a Christmas lunch every year, and he would make the reservations and happily pass out cigars and snifters of brandy to the gang, which was so appreciative of his seasonal greetings that we named him our \u201cEl Presidente\u201d for life. Al, who had so many accomplishments in business, charity and public service, acted like it was the best honor he\u2019d ever received.\n\nOur luncheon group broke up long ago, after several members moved away, but when I think of Al, I like to remember him at our last Christmas party, with a cigar in his mouth and a big smile on his face.\n\nCynthia is the woman he loved and was devoted to, and I have considered her a friend for many years \u2014 even when we politically disagreed, which was often. But she told a whopper about Al\u2019s death when she blamed it \u2014 at least in part \u2014 on Obamacare, and people deserve to know the truth.\n\nBecause of a provision Republicans added to the Affordable Care Act, members of Congress must have a plan through one of the health exchanges that are offered as part of Obamacare. Cynthia and her husband signed up for one in D.C., but there was apparently a glitch in the system, and when Al submitted medical claims for two tests conducted after he had chest pains, he was incorrectly told twice he and his wife weren\u2019t covered by the plan.\n\nI don\u2019t pretend to know what Al thought about Obamacare, especially after his frustrations with the system. But he was an intelligent man who knew the bureaucratic mistakes would eventually be corrected, and his decision not to have a medical test need not have had anything to do with whether he was covered by the plan.\n\nThere was no guarantee, of course, that if Al had taken the cardiac test he would have lived. He was wealthy and didn\u2019t need to rely on Obamacare. Cynthia submitted financial statements to Congress that showed her family\u2019s net worth to be between $20 million and $75 million. She was the 15th wealthiest member of Congress at one point.\n\nAl could have flown to any hospital in the world, paid for any tests doctors thought he should have, and not made a dent in his family\u2019s fortune. Even if he had been concerned about costs, at 65 he was eligible for Medicare, so much of the expense would have been covered.\n\nObamacare wasn\u2019t designed for millionaires like Al and Cynthia, who could easily pay for their health care out of pocket or buy whatever Cadillac insurance coverage they wanted. It was created for low-to-middle-income people who couldn\u2019t afford skyrocketing health premiums or had been denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions. Republicans made members of Congress sign up because they incorrectly thought the unnecessary requirement would cost the bill votes.\n\nEven though I don\u2019t agree with her, I don\u2019t begrudge Cynthia the opportunity to use most political tactics to make her case against Obamacare. But when she uses her late husband as a reason to take away a plan that\u2019s helped millions, it\u2019s offensive and inexcusable.\n\nAt a government oversight committee hearing last week, Cynthia and other Republicans grilled one of the architects of Obamacare, Jonathan Gruber, who infamously said the \u201cstupidity of the American voter\u201d played a major role in the passage of the new health care law. He was red meat to conservatives like Cynthia, who tried to carve him up and spit him out to prove Obamacare is a terrible idea that must be junked.\n\n\u201c[It was] during the course of time that [Al] was having tests by a physician and was told we were not covered by Obamacare, that he decided not to have the last test the doctor asked him to have,\u201d she said.\n\nCynthia quickly couched her charge by saying Obamacare isn\u2019t directly the reason Al died. But she stressed, \u201cI want to suggest that regardless of what has happened to me personally, that there have been so many glitches in the passage and administration of Obamacare that have real-life consequences.\u201d\n\nThe congresswoman unquestionably connected some ambiguous dots together to convey that her husband might be alive today if not for Obamacare.\n\nHer version of Al\u2019s death, and her tough questioning of Gruber and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Administrator Marilyn Tavenner, have made Cynthia a conservative hero. I don\u2019t know if that was the reason she made her bogus claims, but she was applauded by right-wing radio and TV hosts, Tea Party bloggers and every other type of wing-nut you can name. Some examples:\n\nConservativeAmerican.org\u2019s headline blared, \u201cObamacare Kills Congresswoman\u2019s Husband.\u201d\n\n\u201cTX Libertarian\u201d tweeted: \u201cMy heart just broke for Congresswoman Lummis. Her husband died in part due to tests not covered by Ocrapcare. Dear Lord! #RepealThisGarbage.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was heartbreaking to hear this woman\u2019s story,\u201d wrote a reader on the ultra-right website freerepublic.com, which orchestrated campaigns against newsman Dan Rather and the Dixie Chicks, who dared to criticize George W. Bush.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t familiar with Rep. Lummis before this, [but] she was able to keep her composure much more than I would have been able to,\u201d the reader wrote. \u201cJust knowing that the leftist schmucks want what happened to her husband to happen to all of us makes me sick.\u201d\n\nRight-Wing News (motto: \u201cStand Up! Speak Out! Fight Back!\u201d) proclaimed, \u201c[Lummis] has been cheated of years with someone she obviously loved, all because of a socialist mandate and the greed of those such as Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, who pushed this monstrous healthcare law down our throats.\u201d\n\nAl shouldn\u2019t have his name associated with garbage like this that totally misrepresents the reasons for his death. His widow certainly scored her political points, and some people with twisted agendas have exploited her claims and made Obamacare more hated than ever. But the cost of her late husband\u2019s memory wasn\u2019t worth her time in the national spotlight. In her heart, I think she knows that now. I hope so.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
