Brown says that before she was able to control her diagnoses, she\u2019d find herself in the emergency room once a week.\n\n\u201cI threw my meds away, I didn\u2019t care anymore,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI was tired of going through this, the pain. I\u2019d end up in the hospital because everything goes bad when I don\u2019t take my medication.\u201d\n\nAccording to a study of Medicaid claims and encounter data in New York City, published in Health Affairs, 63% of people who visited the Emergency Department more than 15 times in the year 2007 were diagnosed with multiple chronic conditions\u201484.5% had at least one.\n\nBrown is exactly the kind of person that hospitals try to reach through coordinated care programs. By assigning a case manager to help Brown coordinate doctor\u2019s appointments and access preventive care, her illnesses become an emergency less frequently\u2014and Brown says she\u2019s starting to see her health actually improve for the first time in years.\n\nCoordinated Care for a Few, With Lower Costs Overall\n\nSt. Luke\u2019s Hospital in Cedar Rapids is one of the busiest Emergency Rooms in the state, logging more than 55,000 visits each year. Employees noticed that a disproportionate number of visits were from a small group of frequent users.\n\nSallie Selfridge is the program case manager for the Emergency Department Consistent Care Program at St. Luke\u2019s. She says that as coordinators began tracking visit histories through the hospital\u2019s electronic medical record, they found a number of factors for why patients visited more frequently.\n\n\u201cFor some it\u2019s been no insurance. Transportation can be a barrier. I thought we\u2019d have more patients without primary care providers, but that wasn\u2019t the case, it\u2019s just they weren\u2019t utilizing them,\u201d Selfridge said.\n\nIn 2012, Selfridge started developing preventative care plans for 103 patients who visited the ER more than 12 times a year. She coordinated with patients\u2019 primary care providers to make sure the care a patient received in the ER matched their long-term care.\n\n\u201cBest example I can give is I have a gal that had 16 ED visits in two months, all for migraines,\u201d Selfridge said. \u201cWhen I talked to her family physician, the first thing he told us was not to give her narcotics in the ED, because while initially it would take away the headache, it was causing more severe rebound headaches.\u201d\n\nWithin a year, those 103 patients collectively reduced their ER visits by two-thirds. Selfridge says they\u2019ve been enrolling about 10 new patients each month.\n\n\u201cUltimately, the goal of the program is not just to reduce those ED visits. We really want folks to get their medical needs met, just in the most appropriate settings,\u201d Selfridge said.\n\nToday, the program has 390 people enrolled. Emergency Physician Josh Pruitt, who sits on the coordinating committee for the St. Luke\u2019s program, estimates it\u2019s saved the hospital $2.85 million dollars in facility costs alone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a problem across the country. People see these visits increasing, of people that really can be better cared for in an outpatient setting, with less expensive services provided by primary care physicians,\u201d Pruitt said.\n\nPruitt says it shows a shift in how hospitals serve patients who otherwise might be a burden on the system.\n\n\u201cI think for so long we just thought, that\u2019s just part of the job and who people are,\u201d Pruitt said. \u201cThere\u2019s different things we can do to intervene with these folks.\u201d\n\nThe Possibility of Expansion\n\nBecause the Affordable Care Act includes incentives for hospitals that keep costs down, hospitals are looking at these coordinated care programs as a way to adapt. UnityPoint will use St. Luke\u2019s program for multiple hospitals in their network, which reaches throughout Iowa and into Illinois\u2014and Selfridge says she\u2019s been contacted by other hospitals outside Iowa for more information about their model.\n\nUnityPoint is also implementing care coordination programs for people with multiple complex diagnosis and building on an existing program for palliative care for people with serious illnesses.\n\nChief Clinical Officer Monique Reese says 250,000 UnityPoint patients are now part of value-based payment systems, instead of fee-for-service.\n\n\"With the Accountable Care Act and some of the changes, it's really beginning to set up so care is delivered in the community, and we're proactive in caring for patients,\" Reese said.\n\nIn addition, UnityPoint's Palliative Care program\u2014which focuses on treating symptoms and improving a patient\u2019s quality of life after a serious diagnosis\u2014has reduced Emergency room visits for their patients by 54%.\n\nEdit 4/11: A former version of this story used the word \"preventative\" instead of \"preventive care.\" A quotation from Reese was also added.", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "Emergency Rooms are often the catch-all of the medical world, where patients can receive care at any hour, regardless of their ability to pay.
