The case was billed by some as a controversial religious freedom issue because the plaintiff, Clyde Reed, happened to be the pastor of a church, and his attorney is a staff member with the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) \u2013 the group that successfully challenged the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception mandate in last year\u2019s Hobby Lobby suit. But in the end, Reed v. Town of Gilbert looks like it will ultimately be decided on the First Amendment\u2019s free speech protections, not on its free exercise clause.\n\n\u201cYour argument does not turn on the fact that it\u2019s a church\u2019s sign, does it?\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts asked David Cortman, senior counsel and vice president of religious liberty with the ADF.\n\n\u201cI mean,\u201d continued Roberts, \u201cyour argument would be the same if this is a temporary sign about where the soccer game was going to be?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s right,\u201d Cortman replied. \u201c[I]t\u2019s equal treatment for that type of sign.\u201d\n\nUnder the disputed ordinance, Gilbert, a town located southeast of Phoenix allows signs promoting noncommercial \u201cevents\u201d \u2013 in this case, a prayer service \u2013 to be displayed no more than 12 hours before, and one hour after, said event. Additionally, those signs may be no larger than six square feet in size. By contrast, the town of Gilbert allows \u201cpolitical\u201d signs that support candidates running for office or ballot measures to be on display for months prior to an election and up to 10 days after. Those signs may be up to 32 square feet. Meanwhile, \u201cideological\u201d signs that communicate \u201ca message or ideas for noncommercial purposes\u201d may be up to 20 square feet in size and displayed for any amount of time, according to the ordinance.\n\nThe town has defended its sign regulations, saying they\u2019re meant only to protect the community\u2019s road safety and aesthetics, not make value calls based on what the signs say. But Reed, pastor of the Good News Community Church, argued that the ordinance on its face amounts to regulation based on content, and as such, infringes on his First Amendment free speech rights.\n\n\u201cGilbert grants highly favorable treatment to temporary political signs, despite the fact that they post the greatest threat to its interests because of their far greater number,\u201d said the church in court papers. \u201cTo prevail in this case, Gilbert must explain why a 32 square foot sign displayed in the right-of-way virtually all year long is not a threat to safety and aesthetics if it bears a political message, but it is such a threat if it invites people to Good News\u2019 church services. Gilbert has never provided a satisfactory explanation to this question because none exists.\u201d\n\nGood News, a member of the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church, has no permanent place of worship, so it holds its weekly services in different places. For this reason, argues Pastor Reed, the church\u2019s roughly 40 congregants rely on directional signs to know where to go. With Sunday services beginning at 9 a.m., Good News isn\u2019t able to post those signs before dark on Saturday without violating Gilbert\u2019s ordinance.\n\nThe justices appeared skeptical Monday of the town\u2019s regulations, which were upheld by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on the grounds that they addressed only neutral civic concerns. But even the more liberal justices on the bench didn\u2019t seem to buy that argument. When Philip W. Savrin, the attorney representing Gilbert, explained that a sign could all of a sudden be subjected to stricter regulations by simply including the directional language \u201cthree blocks left, two blocks rights,\u201d Justice Breyer exclaimed: \u201cMy goodness! I mean\u2026it does sound as if the town is being a little unreasonable, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nSavrin himself ended up conceding there were some scenarios where the ordinance seemed \u201crather silly.\u201d\n\nRelated: \u2018Religious freedom\u2019 measure moves forward in Michigan\n\nThe Obama administration joined the church in urging the Supreme Court to strike down the Gilbert ordinance \u2013 another factor distinguishing this case from last year\u2019s Hobby Lobby dispute. In Hobby Lobby, the ADF and the Obama administration were at odds over the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that corporations provide birth control coverage for their employees. The administration lost that battle, with the Supreme Court ruling that closely held corporations owned by people with sincerely held religious objections to contraception didn\u2019t have to pay for that coverage.\n\nToday, the ADF is engaged in multiple efforts to expand religious freedom, often at the expense of gay rights and reproductive rights. In Coeur d\u2019Alene, Idaho, the group sued the city last fall on behalf of a chapel that did not want to perform weddings for same-sex couples. In Houston, the ADF got involved in a lawsuit filed against officials after an effort to overturn the city\u2019s equal rights ordinance failed. Houston attorneys in that case subpoenaed the sermons of local pastors who were tied to the repeal referendum as part of the lawsuit\u2019s discovery phase, but the ADF filed a motion to stop them. \u201cThey have embarked upon a witch-hunt,\u201d said ADF Senior Legal Counsel Erik Stanley in a press release.\n\nAdditionally, last fall the ADF organized an event called \u201cPulpit Freedom Sunday,\u201d during which more than 1,500 pastors delivered sermons about political candidates in direct violation of IRS regulation. Greg Lipper, senior litigation counsel for the group Americans United for Separation of Church & State, doesn\u2019t believe Monday\u2019s sign ordinance case falls under the same kind of \u201creligious freedom\u201d category. But he does see it as perhaps fitting into a broader ADF strategy to slowly chip away at the barrier between religion and politics \u2013 one that could potentially roll back advancements for women and the LGBT community.\n\n\u201cI think [Reed v. Town of Gilbert] is mostly a pure free speech case that happens to involve a house of worship,\u201d Lipper told msnbc. \u201cSo on its face, I don\u2019t think a decision in this case would affect same-sex marriage rights or reproductive rights.\u201d\n\nHowever, he continued, \u201cthere is definitely a broader effort at the ADF to exempt houses of worship from laws governing everyone else, and to exempt for-profit businesses with religious owners.\u201d\n\nEven if the sign ordinance case is decided purely on free speech grounds, it could have implications for the anti-abortion movement. Last year, the Supreme Court struck down a Massachusetts law that set a 35-foot buffer zone around abortion clinics, saying it violated anti-abortion protesters\u2019 free speech rights, not their religious rights. That case \u2013 McCullen v. Coakley \u2013 came up briefly during Monday\u2019s arguments, but not in a way that signaled to Lipper the high court would issue a sweeping expansion of First Amendment protections that could boost the anti-abortion movement . And yet, he cautioned, \u201cyou never know.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere have been court decisions over the years where it seems straightforward,\u201d said Lipper. \u201cBut then there\u2019s a time bomb placed in the opinion.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "In the end, Reed v.
