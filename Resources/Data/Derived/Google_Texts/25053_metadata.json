But in Portland, Ore., where Medicare services operate more efficiently, MA plans struggled to offer benefits at or below the costs of competitors, he said.\n\nInitially, Congress responded by paying more for MA in all markets.\n\nIn 2010, the ACA enacted a plan to lower benchmarks for MA incrementally to between 1 and 3 percentage points higher than traditional Medicare by 2017, Miller explained.\n\nCongress also decided to tailor payments by region. It reduced benchmarks for bids in the less competitive markets, such as Miami, and set them higher than fee-for-service plans in more competitive ones, like Portland.\n\nInitially, critics of the ACA believed these changes would sink MA, but that didn't happen. Enrollment increased annually at 9% and the plans are now available in 99% of counties throughout the country, Miller said.\n\nAverage bids for Medicare managed care are currently below fee-for-service, Miller said. However, health maintenance organization (HMOs) usually bid below fee-for-service while preferred provider organizations (PPOs) still bid above traditional Medicare, he added.\n\nTricia Neuman, ScD, director of the program on Medicare Policy for the Kaiser Family Foundation here, said one reason that enrollment hasn't dropped is the aging of Baby Boomers, who become eligible enrollees.\n\nAlso, beneficiaries are accustomed to private insurance and familiar with managed care. They also may prefer the convenience of a \"one-stop-shop\" over choosing multiple plans -- such as Medicare, Medicare Part D, and MediGap -- to gain the same benefits.\n\nAll of the panelists agreed that MA is a \"work in progress,\" but Miller pointed out that ACA \"did what it set out to do\" which was rein in MA spending.\n\nDouglas Holtz-Eakin, PhD, president of the American Action Forum here and chief economic policy advisor for Sen. John McCain in 2008, said he was impressed that even with a budget cut, enrollments in MA plans continued to grow. However, he was reluctant to declare the MA under the ACA a complete success.\n\n\"The question was 'Could you get a lower-budget cost while still having a quality system and actually generating greater health value underneath that?'\" he said. \"I'd say the jury is still out on that.\"\n\nWhatever elements are retained or changed in the MA program in the future will have to be bipartisan, said Holtz-Eakin, who dubbed the program a \"political football.\"\n\nHe added that \"the community broadly has to demonstrate the value proposition and show that it can hit the budget targets and if it does, that's really the key.\"\n\nMiller said MedPAC hopes to see the risk adjustment system rebalanced, so plans that include more beneficiaries with multiple chronic condition aren't penalized.\n\nMedPAC research found that the risk adjustment system in MA underpaid for plans with lots of multiple chronic conditions, and overpaid if beneficiaries were relatively healthy, he explained.\n\nThe commission suggested including a very basic adjustment in the payment system that counts the number of chronic conditions.\n\n\"We think there's an effect that compounds when you have five, six, seven [chronic conditions], there's a cut point, where it starts to matter,\" he said.\n\nHoltz-Eakin agreed that risk adjustment was critical and said his organization was also exploring whether Medicare's star rating system under-rewarded those who have more chronic care conditions.\n\nHe said he supports the somewhat controversial idea of shifting towards a defined contribution model, and believes that using an alternative bidding system for MA would be more effective than relying on fee-for-service benchmarks.\n\n\"Getting the risk-adjustment right, the stars right, and the bidding process right, I think are the three things that are essential to turning MA from a bridge to an actual future for the program,\" Holtz-Eakin said.", "article_metadata":
