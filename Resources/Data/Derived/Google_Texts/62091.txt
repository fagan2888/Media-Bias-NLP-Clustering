New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s presidential campaign has adopted “Telling It Like It Is” as its slogan and, according to his latest national television ad, he wants to tell voters just how scary the world is today.

The 30-second spot, titled “Law Enforcer,” opens with Christie decrying “lawlessness in America and around the world under Barack Obama.”

He rattles off a series of threats, speaking over dramatic music cues and flashing images.

“Sanctuary cities engulfing Americans in crime. Drugs running rampant and destroying lives. ISIS beheading Christians. Iranian radicals with nuclear weapons,” he says ominously.

“Now, Hillary Clinton thinks the law doesn't apply to her,” Christie asks as images of a computer server appear on screen. “Really?”

The former U.S. attorney argues that the country needs a “strong law enforcer as president, someone who says what he means and means what he says.”

The doom and gloom ad, featuring a score more typical of a television drama than a presidential ad, is running on the Fox News Channel and marks Christie’s latest attempt to spark interest in his White House bid.

The two-term governor has consistently lost support in opinion polls since the inaugural GOP presidential debate, while political outsiders like Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina have surged.

Last week a CNN/ORC survey put Christie in 11th place, garnering only three percent support among GOP voters.

If the trend continues, Christie could lose his spot on the main stage at the CNN/Reagan Library debate on September 16 and relegated to the second-tier.
