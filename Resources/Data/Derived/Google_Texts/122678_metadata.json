Jeb Bush proudly proclaimed his own singular place in the GOP.\n\nHe was the only person there, he said, to have gotten a spanking from a former U.S. president and a wedgie from the next one, his fellow Southern governor\u2014and big brother\u2014George W. Bush.\n\nFifteen years later, as Jeb prepares for a presidential campaign of his own, the days of spankings and wedgies are complicating his life. This is not only because finessing questions about the U.S. invasion of Iraq was made more difficult by family loyalty. But the name and past policies attached to it carry some baggage: Several of his 2016 Republican rivals have given him verbal wedgies just because he is a Bush. \u201cI don\u2019t come from a family dynasty,\u201d Mike Huckabee said while announcing his candidacy, \u201cbut a working family.\u201d\n\nScott Walker makes a point of saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t inherit fame or fortune from my family.\u201d And even fellow Floridian Marco Rubio, an erstwhile friend of Jeb\u2019s, has said that if his parents hadn\u2019t emigrated from Cuba, \u201cthere\u2019s no way in the world that I could have the same dreams, and potentially the same future, as the son of a president or the son of a millionaire.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s going on here?\n\nPart of the answer is simply that Jeb Bush is a well-connected frontrunner, with high name-identification and an ability to raise vast sums of money, meaning that those trailing him in the polls believe they have to reel him in. In that sense, Jeb is a natural target. A second part of the answer, however, is that one reason Jeb has that name ID and those high-dollar connections is because his last name is Bush \u2014 and the other candidates resent him for it, especially since it threatens to take off the table the past dynasty argument they hope to use against the likely Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.\n\nBut the biggest issue here may be a third factor: the changing landscape of the GOP itself.\n\nDespite winning re-election, George W. Bush was not a popular president when he left Washington. The stalemated war in Iraq, a perception his administration dithered in response to Hurricane Katrina, a sea of federal debt accumulated during his tenure, and a financial crisis that marred his last months in office soured much of the country on the 43rd president. He\u2019s better liked now by the public than he was in 2009, but party professionals still remember the toll Bush\u2019s presidency took on down-ticket candidates.\n\nMoreover, the Republican Party has largely shifted away from both previous Bush administrations on a range of policy issues. In the age of the Tea Party, George H.W. Bush\u2019s 1990 tax deal with Democrats is anathema. And George W. Bush-era bailouts and big government programs such as TARP, No Child Left Behind, and the expansion of Medicare are symbols of runaway federal spending and intrusive government overreach not qualitatively different from Obamacare. Jeb Bush will be asked about his stances on his brother\u2019s policies, as will the rest of the field.\n\n\u201cMost of them view it as an opportunity, as they did with Iraq, to distinguish themselves,\u201d says David McIntosh, president of the fiscally conservative Club for Growth, who noted that members of his group were impressed by Jeb\u2019s economic record as governor when he participated in their forum earlier this year.\n\n\u201cI think W. becomes a foil for them to show how they\u2019d be different,\u201d McIntosh says. \u201cWith Jeb in the race, it\u2019s an easy way to get out there and draw the distinctions, and they\u2019re going to take advantage of it.\u201d\n\nLast week, Jeb Bush finally started to see around the corner.\n\nAsked by a voter in New Hampshire to name an issue on which he differs with his brother, the soon-to-be presidential candidate offered this: \u201cI think in Washington during my brother\u2019s time Republicans spent too much money.\n\n\u201cHe could have brought budget discipline to Washington, D.C.,\u201d Bush continued, adding that he doesn\u2019t feel compelled to criticize past Republican presidents, given that the two living ones happen to be his dad and brother. \u201cEvery president makes mistakes. The question is what do you do, what do you learn from those mistakes?\u201d\n\nStriking out as his own man will be made difficult, not just by primary voters but by his primary opponents who have fashioned campaign themes with such names as New American Century, Defeat the Washington Machine, and Our American Revival.\n\n\u201cIn all political campaigns, the successful candidates are about the future\u2014never about the past,\u201d says one Republican strategist working for one of the presidential candidates. \u201cVoters want to know where we're going, and the additional struggle for Bush is sort of a \u2018been there/done that.\u2019 And he\u2019s also of an older generation.\u201d\n\nAlso while in New Hampshire this week, Bush said he was proud of his family. \u201cI love my mom and dad. I love my brother. And people are just going to have to get over that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d\n\nLoyalty to family is understandable and admirable, and no one should expect Jeb Bush to dismiss his family. Some Republicans, however, have been surprised to see how much he has embraced his brother, specifically when he said recently that he is his top adviser on Israeli relations. But in presidential politics, such things can be complicated. A recent Bloomberg/Purple Strategies focus group of likely caucus-goers in Des Moines unveiled concerns not with Jeb\u2019s stances on immigration and Common Core but on his ties to his brother, underscored by his stumbles over the Iraq question. Participants indicated concern about the dynasty dynamic, and some voiced interest in candidates who represent the future. One participant questioned whether Bush could be successful against Hillary Clinton in a general election match-up that would, in a sense, pit two past presidencies against each other.\n\nThat\u2019s where Jeb Bush could have the most trouble, and where rivals can hope to make their play against him. His own credentials would normally be appealing to the party hoping to win in the general election: He has executive experience inside politics and out, he speaks Spanish and has a deep understanding of immigration reform, and his record as governor of the diverse and delegate-rich swing state of Florida is strongly conservative on both fiscal and social fronts. But his family name evokes two things Republican candidates are trying to distance themselves from this cycle: the establishment and the past.\n\n\u201cIt was the George. W Bush administration where they started the TARP and the bailouts and all the rest of it, and the downturn of the economy began in that administration,\u201d says the GOP strategist. \u201c\u2026 Jeb's problem is he is going to have to spend an inordinate amount of money redefining himself so that he's not more of the same. I don't know any candidate other than Hillary Clinton who is burdened by that.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Clinton will have to contend with her own dynasty dynamic, and Republicans would argue that she wouldn\u2019t be in the position she is today without the fundraising and networking machine she and Bill Clinton have built over the past three decades. Hillary is running a more liberal campaign than her husband did, reflective of the ways in which the Democratic Party has changed since he was in office. And there are powerful voices in the party pushing her to be more progressive on economic issues.\n\nBut she has managed to clear her field in a way Bush has not. There are many reasons for this, including ways in which the Clintons have cultivated and maintained Democratic support, the lack of a deep bench on their side and the large cadre of viable candidates on the other side. But an overarching explanation could also be the differing remnants of the two former presidents.\n\nClinton\u2019s husband is still wildly popular among Democrats, and his presidency is often hailed even by Republicans as a time when the two parties worked together and the economy was good.\n\n\u201cThe Clinton record is a strength. For many in the middle class and working class, the period from 1995 from 2001 was one of the longest runs of middle-class prosperity,\u201d David Frum, a speechwriter for George W. Bush and now a columnist at The Atlantic, told RealClearPolitics.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are wary of that, so among the problems Jeb has is the Bush years were not good years for most Americans,\u201d Frum continues. \u201cAnd while he will try to separate himself from his brother\u2019s economics record, he\u2019s going to raise a 100 million dollars from people who were supporters of his brother.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Clinton is trying to strike out as her own woman and is insistent on her husband staying on the sidelines for now, hoping to avoid criticisms of dynasty and power-hungry politics. There\u2019s a feeling among the other Republicans running for office that they can drive that narrative against her, and push forward a sense of freshness and innovation from the GOP. That advantage disappears, some argue, if Bush is the nominee.\n\nOf the long bench of Republicans running for president, only Lindsey Graham and Rick Santorum served in Washington during Bush 43\u2019s administration, which makes it easier for rest of the rivals to distance themselves from that past. When faced with the Iraq question himself, Graham pivoted to take aim at Obama for letting the situation there get worse. Indeed, Republicans don\u2019t want to revisit the past because they feel they have a better target in the present.\n\nThe race is \u201cgoing to be about the last president; it\u2019s not going to be about the president before him,\u201d says Republican strategist Stuart Stevens, a veteran of Bush, McCain and Romney presidential campaigns.\n\nIn fact, Stevens argues, \u201cif Jeb wasn\u2019t in the race, they would all be actively trying to solicit the support of George W. Bush.\u201d\n\nOthers, though, see the connection a little differently.\n\n\u201cOnce an unpopular president has departed office, the defeats and disappointments of his tenure vanish into American amnesia,\u201d Frum wrote in a recent column. \u201cBut that amnesia is highly conditional on the ex-president and his namesakes staying away from politics.\u201d\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s what Barbara Bush had in mind when she initially opposed her younger son entering presidential politics. \u201cWe\u2019ve had enough Bushes,\u201d she said then, though she supports him now.\n\nPrimary voters will ultimately determine whether that\u2019s true. But as the first GOP debates approach this summer, the rivals for the nomination may be inclined to take up that line to avoid getting swept into an undertow of the past themselves.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Standing on the floor of the 2000 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, ready to hand over his state delegation\u2019s votes for the party\u2019s presidential nominee, then-Florida Gov....", "title": "Dynasty Dynamic: Will the Past Vex Jeb -- and His Rivals? | RealClearPolitics", "fragment": "!", "twitter": {"site": "@RealClearNews", "card": "summary"}, "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/05/26/dynasty_dynamic_will_the_past_vex_jeb_--_and_his_rivals_126706.html", "image": "http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/299428_5_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Standing on the floor of the 2000 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, ready to hand over his state delegation\u2019s votes for the party\u2019s presidential nominee, then-Florida Gov....", "title": "Dynasty Dynamic: Will the Past Vex Jeb -- and His Rivals? | RealClearPolitics"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "tweetmeme-title": "Dynasty Dynamic: Will the Past Vex Jeb -- and His Rivals? | RealClearPolitics", "keywords": "Bill Clinton,Hillary Clinton,GEORGE H.W.
