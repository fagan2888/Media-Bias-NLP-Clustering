Jim Webb said Sunday that he will run for president in 2016 if he can be convinced that he can compete financially without selling out on the core issues he wants to push on the campaign trail.\n\nThe decorated Vietnam veteran and former Navy secretary, who has flirted with a White House run since November, said Sunday on C-SPAN\u2019s \u201cWashington Journal\u201d that he is still trying to figure out if he could launch a viable bid.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re listening, talking to people, about the issues, but also having to make a judgment about whether you can actually put together the type of funding to compete and still be independent,\u201d Mr. Webb said, adding that he would enter the race \u201cunder the right circumstances.\u201d\n\nMr. Webb, 69, is considered a long-shot for the Democratic nomination, with polls showing former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton well ahead of potential rivals, including Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to overstate how difficult it will be for a non-Hillary Clinton candidate to gain traction, donor money and endorsements the later we get in the cycle and the more her nomination feels like a fait accompli,\u201d said Democratic strategist Christy Setzer. \u201cBut to the extent there\u2019s room in the Democratic primary, it\u2019s to the left of Clinton \u2014 not a space Webb naturally occupies.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the rationale he\u2019s identified for his candidacy \u2014 the need for the Democratic Party to fix its problem with white working class people \u2014 isn\u2019t as much of an issue with Clinton or Elizabeth Warren, who tend to resonate with those audiences, much more so than Obama ever did,\u201d Ms. Setzer said. \u201cIf Webb can gain any traction, he\u2019ll need to carve out space on an issue Clinton\u2019s not talking about or can\u2019t talk about.\u201d\n\nMr. Webb shook up Washington in 2006 when he came from behind in Virginia\u2019s U.S. Senate race to topple Republican Sen. George Allen, helping Democrats regain control of the Senate.\n\nSporting his son\u2019s combat boots on the campaign trail, Mr. Webb, a Republican-turned-Democrat who opposed the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, called for a more clearly articulated foreign policy and for more economic fairness.\n\nIn the Senate, Mr. Webb muscled through a new GI Bill and led efforts on criminal justice reform. He also voted for the Wall Street bailout, known as TARP, as well as Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI believe we did need to move forward,\u201d Mr. Webb said Sunday about his Obamacare vote. \u201cThe benefits in the bill were better then voting it down.\u201d\n\nMr. Webb chose not to run for re-election in 2012, and last year released a book \u2014 his ninth \u2014 titled \u201cI Heard My Country Calling.\u201d\n\nMr. Webb said Sunday that the nation needs leadership, and warned the nation\u2019s approach to international affairs and the use of military focus has \u201cbecome extremely vague.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis notion of \u2018responsibility to protect\u2019 or \u2018humanitarian intervention\u2019 \u2014 it is not clear. The president could do that on Ireland tomorrow for all we know. it is a very loose doctrine and it is not healthy for the country,\u201d the former senator said.\n\nMr. Webb said elected leaders must strengthen the nation\u2019s immigration system by stemming the flow of illegal immigrants into the country and providing a path to citizenship for those who have been in the country 10 to 15 years and meet a certain set of criteria, such as learning English.\n\nIn addition, Mr. Webb said wealthy donors have an outsized influence on the political process.\n\n\u201cThe power of the people who have made enormous wealth in the country to control the political process is obvious. It\u2019s obvious,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what happens to the average American who wants to vote for someone who wants to bring about change?\u201d\n\nDemocratic strategist Jim Manley said he is a \u201cbig fan\u201d of Mr. Webb, adding that it would be interesting to see how willing the combat veteran is to embrace the retail side of presidential politics.\n\n\u201cBy all accounts, he really wasn\u2019t having a lot of fun in the Senate,\u201d Mr. Manley said. \u201cSo I am not sure how much fun he is going to have on the campaign trail.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on what I have seen over the years, he would be one of the more unorthodox candidates we have seen in many years,\u201d the strategist said. \u201cHe marches to the beat of his own drummer, and I don\u2019t expect that to change.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Virginia Sen.
