White House resorts to emojis to appeal to millennials

The White House has a new social media plan underway to lure in young people, and it revolves around emojis.

BuzzFeed News first reported the plan Wednesday night, and the White House unveiled its first emoji-themed tweet on Thursday:

Here's how the Affordable Care Act is benefiting millions of young Americans → http://t.co/ayzVqvw674 #ACAWorks pic.twitter.com/SFEGOrZeVq — The White House (@WhiteHouse) October 9, 2014

BuzzFeed also noted that the White House’s October economic report on millennials went with a listicle title: “15 ECONOMIC FACTS ABOUT MILLENNIALS.”

The contents of the report, however, are less chuckle-worthy, observing millennials’ negative job outlooks thanks to the recession and increasing loan debt.

The White House has been working hard the last several years to be “hip.” The White House blog now regularly features posts like “The White House’s 13 Favorite GIFs of 2013.”

The emoji rollout precedes President Obama’s speech targeting millennials Thursday, in which he is expected to address student aid and healthcare.
