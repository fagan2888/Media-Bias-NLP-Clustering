Osweiler jerseys weren\u2019t available in the Broncos\u2019 store last week and certainly not anywhere in Chicago.\n\nThe young man behind the end zone had taken an old orange jersey, cut white strips of tape in the shape of \u201c1\u2019s\u2019 and applied them in front of the \u201c7\u201ds and covered \u201cElway\u201d on the back with a magic-marked, home-made name: \u201cOSWEILER\u201d.\n\nOsweiler and his lonely loyalist were ahead of the curve.\n\nAnd nobody really cares about the No. 6 jersey worn before in Denver or in Chicago now. Jay Cutler\u2019s number is deep-sixed.\n\nThe raw Osweiler completely outplayed the experienced Cutler. In his first NFL start, Brock finished with two touchdown passes, zero interceptions and a 127.1 passer rating. In his 130th start Cutler had an interception, zero touchdowns and a 70.4 rating.\n\nSame old Jay. Brand new Brock.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not deflating,\u201d Cutler said. \u201cWe just need to do better.\u201d\n\nCutler was giving lame excuses in 2008 when he was 25 and the Broncos\u2019 staring quarterback.\n\nHappy birthday, Brock. He turned 25 Sunday. \u201cI could not be more proud of the entire football team,\u201d Osweiler said.\n\nThe fan in the stands was not the only Osweiler advocate. Linebacker Von Miller sits on the charter next to Osweiler on every road trip. \u201cHe was the same Brock as always. No different. He\u2019s confident, calm, cool. I knew he could go out there and play well. We see him play every day.\u201d\n\nMiller helped clinch the victory. With 2:30 remaining, the Bears were down 17-9 and at the Broncos\u2019 23-yard line. Miller switched from the left to the right rushing side, stunted, then flew after Cutler, grabbed his arm and forced a fumble. The mid-air ball was recovered by Malik Jackson.\n\nSoldier Field emptied, but the Bears would have one more try in the final two minutes. They scored on a 2-yard run late, but a rather ridiculous run for the two-point conversion was stuffed by safety T.J. Ward.\n\nBroncos win! They celebrated like Little League champions in the locker room minutes later.\n\nThe Broncos had been going backward of late, losing two in a row, and Osweiler replaced the wounded Peyton Manning, who stayed home.\n\nAnd, on Saturday afternoon, the Broncos were going in circles. Because of a snowstorm in Chicago, the Broncos\u2019 plane circled in the sky six times before a seriously late arrival.\n\nAccording to Broncos coach Gary Kubiak, \u201cthis may sound crazy,\u201d but the travails \u201cmight have been kind of a nice icebreaker for the team. We sat on the plane for 4 \u00bd hours; everyone was fidgety . . . We had a great end to (Saturday night), and we played with the same energy. Maybe we need to take a look at that and get the plane to do it again.\u201d\n\nOsweiler\u2019s beginning in his inaugural start was imposing. The Broncos went 74 yards in four plays, with Brock discovering Demaryius Thomas over the middle on a 48-yard connection. (It recalled another young quarterback tossing a short pass to Thomas for a quick scoring strike.)\n\nShortly afterward, Cutler should have been intercepted, then was sacked.\n\nTwo quarterbacks, heading in opposite directions, literally.\n\nIt was pleasant to know Bears coach John Fox hasn\u2019t mellowed. He said of the Osweiler-Thomas play coverage: \u201cYou guys always want to hear the blame game.\u201d On playing his former team: \u201cThere are more guys to say hi to after the game.\u201d\n\nBye, John. Bye, Jay.\n\nHello, Brock.\n\nMore No. 17 jerseys might be worn in the stadium on Sunday. Who\u2019s coming to town?\n\nOh, them!\n\nBrady & Brock. Methinks it could be a big game.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Paige: Brock Osweiler outplays Jay Cutler in Chicago", "title": "Paige: Brock Osweiler outplays Jay Cutler in Chicago", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/22/paige-brock-osweiler-outplays-jay-cutler-in-chicago/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-22T17:38:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:00:25+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Brock Osweiler, Woody Paige"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1145\"", "article_summary": "CHICAGO \u2014 At frost-biting, forbidding Soldier Field, there were only two \u201cOsweiler\u201d jerseys \u2014 one on the field of green and another in the sea of blue.\nIn his first NFL start, Brock finished with two touchdown passes, zero interceptions and a 127.1 passer rating.\nOsweiler jerseys weren\u2019t available in the Broncos\u2019 store last week and certainly not anywhere in Chicago.\nBrock Osweiler did the No.\nIn his 130th start Cutler had an interception, zero touchdowns and a 70.4 rating."}
