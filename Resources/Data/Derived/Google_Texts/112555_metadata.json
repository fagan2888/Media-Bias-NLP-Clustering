Advertisement\n\n\n\nWelcome to SN&R\u2019s fifth annual Grinches of the Year awards. Yes, we know it\u2019s the holidays, which means we\u2019re supposed to be sitting by fires in plaid, flannel threads while sipping hot toddies and reading stories about magic trains and parents who can\u2019t hear bells.\n\nBut we\u2019re SN&R. And for us, the end of the year is to call out Sacramentans whose hearts were just a few sizes too small. You know, the public officials, corporations, local celebrities and basketball teams who deserve coal in their stockings on Thursday.\n\nAnd so, our 2014 Grinches. Muah ha ha.\n\nSacramento\u2019s Grinch of the Year\n\nCue the slow clap for Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones. This was the year the county\u2019s top lawman concealed his department\u2019s use of warrantless cellphone surveillance technology, known as Stingray; helped lobby a bogus case against Proposition 47; struggled to comply with state laws regarding the detention of undocumented immigrants; and used the tragic deaths of two officers to burnish his political rep on YouTube while trashing the president\u2019s immigration policy. Just one of those would have merited Jones one of SN&R\u2019s annual Grinch awards. Taken together, they earn him top-dog honors\u2014and a tongue-in-cheek poem. On this list, it\u2019s bad to be king:\n\nThe Not-So-Great Scott\n\nby Raheem F. Hosseini\n\nSheriff Scott Jones\n\nKnows down in his bones\n\nHe\u2019s the right man for the job,\n\nDon\u2019t you fret or sob.\n\n\u201cWhich job,\u201d you ask,\n\n\u201cThe badge or the mask?\u201d\n\nNo questions, News 10.\n\nJones won\u2019t answer them.\n\nA badge made of tin,\n\nAs is his grin;\n\nThe rules don\u2019t apply\n\nTo one of the good guys.\n\nThat\u2019s why he spies our phones,\n\nOr so says Scott Jones:\n\n\u201cStingray protects us all!\n\nIts secrecy shouldn\u2019t gall!\n\n\u201cAnd immigrants are A-OK.\n\nBut let\u2019s lock them away.\n\nObama has it wrong,\n\nOur walls must be strong.\n\n\u201cCall me Great Scott.\n\nThe bad guys can rot!\n\nThere is evil, there is good,\n\nNow fetch me my hood!\n\n\u201cIf Justice works blind,\n\nThen so shall I!\n\nI entertain no new thoughts\n\nThat my pension hasn\u2019t bought.\n\n\u201cThe paradigm mustn\u2019t shift\n\n\u2018Twould cause a great rift.\n\nFill my jails to the brim.\n\nCompassion is the sin.\n\n\u201cThe law is a tool\n\nThat my hand will rule.\n\nA hammer, in fact,\n\nTo beat progress back.\n\n\u201cMy name is Scott Jones\n\nAnd I live in the zone.\n\nMy message almost done,\n\nDo support my congressional run.\n\n\u201cVote for me. Do what I say.\n\nWe\u2019ll all be much happier that way.\u201d\n\nHonorable Mentions:\n\nSay it ain\u2019t so, Shirley\n\nIt\u2019s frankly heartbreaking to have Sacramento City Clerk Shirley Concolino make an appearance in our annual rogue roundup. It\u2019s tempting to give Judge Timothy Frawley the Grinch for blocking a public vote on the city\u2019s massive subsidy for a new Kings arena. But blaming Frawley would be taking the easy way out. It was Concolino who officially refused those citizen initiative petitions, and disenfranchised tens of thousands of Sacramento residents who wanted a vote.\n\nRemember, the idea that citizens should have a vote on public financing of arenas and stadiums was a longstanding policy, adopted by the city council in 1996. We can\u2019t even call Concolino a Grinch, because she and her staff are almost always total pros. But she definitely Grinched that one. (C.G.)\n\nTurns out popular Fox40 personality Sabrina Rodriguez is (allegedly) a big-time shoplifter. Coal for you!\n\n\n\nFox-y Grinch\n\nFormer Fox40 morning-show reporter and anchor Sabrina Rodriguez was living large until that May morning when her (now ex-) fianc\u00e9 allegedly blew up their south Sacramento home. He was allegedly manufacturing \u201cdabs,\u201d or what\u2019s known at police headquarters as concentrated marijuana. The May 6 incident also sparked a domino effect of bad mojo, including Rodriguez and her ex Nicholas Gray\u2019s arrest for shoplifting.\n\nRodriguez was such a nice, young woman on TV. Caring, smart. But then an arrest report detailed a month-long history of theft and braggadocio. Let\u2019s revisit:\n\nEx-fianc\u00e9 crows in a text to Rodriguez that it was so \u201ceasy\u201d to snatch $640 in purses from the Vacaville BCBG outlet in March 2013. Rodriguez texts back: \u201cAwesome. I love when a plan comes together.\u201d\n\nNow we know Rodriguez was as phony as a Louis Vuitton knockoff. (N.M.)\n\nGrinches on a train\n\nTrains have transported dangerous stuff, including volatile Bakken crude oil, for years. That\u2019s not why oil refiners such as Valero Refining Company get a Grinch award this year. The company announced a plan to increase the amount of Bakken crude that would be traveling through local neighborhoods like Roseville, Midtown, West Sacramento and Davis on the way to Vallejo. The new number would be about 100 car trains per day.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of dangerous, potentially explosive crude, were the unfortunate derailment of a train to occur.\n\nBut the bigger worry is that the National Transportation Safety Board says the tanks used to transport this oil need to be upgraded. The board also says they should probably take safer routes, ones not through populated or environmentally sensitive areas, and that local responders and companies need to have better action plans in place\u2014you know, in case the worst-case scenario happens.\n\nCommunities are fighting back against these train shipments. But even more are going through Sacramento neighborhoods as you read this, according to Union Pacific.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget a UP train (thankfully full of corn and not explosive oil) derailed into the Feather River Canyon just weeks ago. (N.M.)\n\nDoh-O-U\n\nLet\u2019s give it up one last time for the leadership at the city of Sacramento\u2019s Department of Utilities!\n\nTo recap: For years, city officials put off installing water meters at homes, despite a state law and, recently, a drought. When the DOU finally got around to doing the install, they approved a plan that cost hundreds-of-millions of dollars more than most cities subject to the state\u2019s meter mandate. DOU leaders also rejected a city audit questioning this plan.\n\nAnyway, the plan was approved unanimously by council. Construction crews began tearing up streets and sidewalks in neighborhoods a couple of years ago. Turns out they\u2019ve been, in many cases, replacing water mains and pipes that just might be in perfectly good condition. It\u2019s crazy\u2014yet all the while the DOU has defended the project to SN&R.\n\nBut this year, investigative reporter Joe Rubin exposed the plan\u2019s folly, which led the city manager to put a halt on the big install this past November. (See \u201cFlushing money\u201d by Joe Rubin, SN&R Feature Story, November 13.) Now, the city says it\u2019s rethinking whether it\u2019s wise to spend hundreds of millions on work that probably is unnecessary.\n\nIn the meantime, SN&R has serious concerns about the DOU, its management doctrine and why such a flawed and wasteful plan was approved in the first place. The city\u2019s response to those concerns: \u201cWe are moving on.\u201d That\u2019s how city spokesperson Linda Tucker explained the DOU\u2019s refusal to come clean.\n\nThe DOU also decided this year to withhold information from the public about how much water is used by bottlers like Nestl\u00e9 and Coca Cola\u2014apparently at the request of commercial water users. All this secrecy and waste are pretty hard to swallow. (C.G.)\n\nThey\u2019re dreaming of white suburbs\n\nThe riots in Ferguson, Mo., this year weren\u2019t just about profound problems in our criminal-justice system. It took years of racial and economic segregation to lay the groundwork for Ferguson.\n\nThe development patterns are pretty familiar if you look around Sacramento. In fact, housing segregation is a major factor in any number of social ills\u2014from gang crime to failing schools.\n\nA few years ago, Sacramento County embarked on an ambitious effort to fight economic segregation by requiring affordable housing to be included in new development areas. It didn\u2019t last. This year the Sacramento County Board of Supervisors\u2014having received their marching orders from the developers whose campaign cash keeps them in office\u2014abandoned the inclusionary housing strategy.\n\nHonestly, they never really gave it a chance to work in the first place. So we\u2019ll keep building tony new suburbs and keep segregating low-income families into ghettos. What could possibly go wrong? (C.G.)\n\nAll they want for Christmas is a community-benefits agreement\n\nBack in May, the Kings and the mayor posterized downtown\u2019s longstanding residents and small businesses.\n\nHere\u2019s how: When developers build major projects like sports stadiums or arenas in cities such as San Diego or Los Angeles, there are typically things called \u201ccommunity benefits agreements.\u201d These CBAs happen because major development often impacts existing businesses and residents. CBAs ensure that there will be things like affordable housing, fair-wage jobs, interest-free loans and subsidies for people displaced.\n\nCities leaders and mayors often push for theses CBAs. When they built the Staples Center, home to the L.A. Lakers and the Clippers, the CBA with the developer included $1 million for parks-and-rec improvements, local-hiring requirements, a 20-percent affordable-housing requirement and a lot more.\n\nHere in Sacramento, not so much. This past May, Mayor Kevin Johnson and the Kings sidestepped a group pushing for a small CBA and instead launched their own group, called Sacramento First, to create the appearance of giving a damn. This new group didn\u2019t include any impacted groups but instead welcomed in pro-arena city officials, Kings reps and lawyers, the mayor\u2019s chief of staff and even the arena\u2019s architects.\n\nBasically, it was a way for the Kings and the mayor to make it look like they were doing something for those adversely impacted by the arena. But all they gave them was coal. (N.M.)\n\nUber\u2019s political games and shady dealings were very Grinchy in 2014.\n\n\n\nOh what fun it is to ride?\n\nBrutal assaults on passengers, threats to journalists and bribing politicians. These are some of the reasons Uber is on our naughty list this year. Our own Mayor Kevin Johnson took Uber money, then used his position to work against laws that would regulate rideshare companies. At the same time, Sacramento is tightening rules on local taxi drivers, including new tests and new requirements to speak English and follow a dress code. All things Uber drivers are exempt from, because they\u2019re taxi-industry \u201cdisruptors,\u201d not taxi drivers. (But really, they are taxi drivers.)\n\nSpeaking of disruption, how about when Uber quadrupled rates in downtown Sydney after an armed gunman barricaded himself in a cafe with a bunch of hostages. Uber calls this \u201csurge pricing.\u201d Which is exactly what Krampus would say. (C.G.)\n\n\u2018L\u2019 is for the way you \u2026 lose\n\nIt\u2019s been nearly two months since Measure L bombed at the ballot box. So long that, in fact, we can hardly remember which incarnation it was of K.J.\u2019s strong-mayor proposal. Anyway, why is Measure L on our list? Waste.\n\nAll those campaign donations, more than a million dollars, spent on what? The only silver lining is that Measure L\u2019s defeat united a progressive front against corporate powers that be. Maybe there\u2019s good in the strong Grinch after all? (N.M.)\n\nThis is what democracy looks like\n\nEligible voters in California and Sacramento County excavated their way to new low-bottom records this year\u2014twice. This past June, a measly 18.4 percent of eligible state voters and 21.3 percent of those in Sacramento County participated in the statewide primary\u2014both historic lows. We dropped the bar yet again a few months later during the November 4 general election, when only 30.9 percent of eligible California voters and 34.4 percent of Sacramento County ones dragged themselves to the polls. In other nations, voting is seen as a privilege. Here, it\u2019s like writing thank-you cards or using turn signals. We all know we should do it, but, on the other hand, to hell with other people. (RFH)\n\nUC Grinch\n\nGet this: The Regents of the University of California put raising student tuition in the crosshairs this year. Again. And despite strong, vocal objection from Gov. Jerry Brown.\n\nThere was a battle. Brown pressed hard. Students banged and protested and raised hell. And yet the Regents voted to bump tuition by at least 5 percent each year over the next five years. Higher education at California\u2019s premier universities was already out of reach for so many residents. Now \u2026 good luck. (N.M.)\n\nThe un-fairer sex\n\nFrom popular entertainment to higher education, there was no escaping ugly acts of men behaving savagely. Over the summer, the anonymous d-bags of GamerGate drew attention to the misogynistic underbelly of video game culture. Then, National Football League commissioner Roger Goodell marred America\u2019s biggest sport with his cowardly response to Ray Rice\u2019s caught-on-camera domestic brutality. In November, Rolling Stone\u2019s (flawed) coverage of an alleged pattern of rape within the University of Virginia\u2019s fraternity system renewed calls to stop ignoring campus sexual assaults. Outside the U.S., April brought the appalling mass abduction of hundreds of Nigerian schoolgirls by the militant Islamist group, Boko Haram. Reports circulated in November from Kenya of male attacks on women who dared wear mini-skirts. Recently, a terrorist group that\u2019s against female education massacred hundreds of Pakistani schoolchildren.\n\nAnd then there was Bill Cosby. TV\u2019s favorite dad was toppled by allegations that he drugged and sexually assaulted numerous women, retroactively tarnishing the childhoods of an entire generation of \u201980s kids. To men everywhere: It\u2019s time to burn those Cosby sweaters\u2014and grow up.
