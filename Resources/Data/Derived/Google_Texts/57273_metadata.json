When she recently brought two of her children to the Logan Square Health Clinic, she and the kids got more than a checkup from the doctor.\n\nGabriel received some fresh onions, cabbage, bananas and tomatoes from a truckload of fresh produce parked right next to the clinic. It was one-stop-shopping for a doctor's visit, and some fresh produce.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more convenient, actually, very convenient,\u201d Gabriel said.\n\nMore than convenient, it's one way of dealing with increasing numbers of residents who appear to be going hungry in Cook County. The free produce is provided by the Greater Chicago Food Depository, which says that one out of every six county residents is now getting some food from a food pantry or soup kitchen.\n\n\u201cDespite the fact that there are signs of rebounding in the economy, we are serving more people than we have ever served in the history of our organization,\u201d said Kate Maehr of the Greater Chicago Food Depository.\n\nDoctors at Cook County's clinics are also seeing more evidence of hunger, in part because of the influx of newly insured patients.\n\n\u201cOver the last few years, because of the Affordable Care Act, we are now caring for a whole slew of a population of patients that we never cared for before,\u201d said Dr. Denis Cunill of the Logan Square Health Clinic.\n\nNew patients are now routinely screened for \"food insecurity.\" If they need help, a doctor writes them a prescription, not for drugs, but for fresh produce from one of the Food Depository Fresh Trucks.\n\n\u201cWe think that the Affordable Care Act has done a nice job of taking poor individuals, who before couldn't get health care coverage, and getting them health care coverage, but it doesn't do anything about putting groceries on their table or food in their stomach,\u201d said Jay Shannon, CEO of Cook County Health and Hospital System.\n\nThe food depository's Executive Director said linking the county's health services to the nutritional programs makes perfect sense.\n\n\u201cWe recognized that we were serving a lot of the same clients. There are men and women and children who are going into county health clinics to get care, and they're also turning to food pantries and soup kitchens to get emergency food assistance,\u201d Maehr said.\n\n\u201cWe need to take a step back and realize how much food is medicine, and the medicine therefore is the food,\u201d Dr. Cunill said.\n\n\n\nIf the Logan Square pilot program succeeds, produce trucks could eventually end up at all 16 Cook County health clinics.\n\nLast year, the food depository distributed 23-million pounds of fresh fruit and vegetables to residents of Cook County.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Seventeen million Americans have signed up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act, and in Cook County, many of the new patients are receiving a surprise diagnosis that they're undernourished.", "author": "FOX", "og": {"site_name": "WFLD", "description": "Seventeen million Americans have signed up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act, and in Cook County, many of the new patients are receiving a surprise diagnosis that they're undernourished.", "title": "New evidence suggests Cook County is facing a hunger crisis", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.lakana.com/media.fox32chicago.com/photo/2015/10/06/D7179F4E41164062B46852AFB2ED8BF5_1444187567821_315303_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "height": 360}, "url": "http://www.fox32chicago.com/news/chicago-at-the-tipping-point/30771098-story", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.fox32chicago.com", "description": "Seventeen million Americans have signed up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act, and in Cook County, many of the new patients are receiving a surprise diagnosis that they're undernourished.", "title": "New evidence suggests Cook County is facing a hunger crisis", "image": {"src": "http://static.lakana.com/media.fox32chicago.com/photo/2015/10/06/D7179F4E41164062B46852AFB2ED8BF5_1444187567821_315303_ver1.0_640_360.jpg"}, "creator": "WFLD", "site": "WFLD", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 115512618480878}, "keywords": "tipping_point,cook_county,hunger_crisis,chicago,Chicago at the Tipping Point,Mobile News Feed,Home,News,Local,Larry Yellen", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca6fa\"", "article_summary": "New evidence suggests Cook County is facing a hunger crisis Chicago at the Tipping Point New evidence suggests Cook County is facing a hunger crisis Seventeen million Americans have signed up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act, and in Cook County, many of the new patients are receiving a surprise diagnosis that they're undernourished.\nIf the Logan Square pilot program succeeds, produce trucks could eventually end up at all 16 Cook County health clinics.\nMore than convenient, it's one way of dealing with increasing numbers of residents who appear to be going hungry in Cook County.\nGabriel received some fresh onions, cabbage, bananas and tomatoes from a truckload of fresh produce parked right next to the clinic.\nLast year, the food depository distributed 23-million pounds of fresh fruit and vegetables to residents of Cook County."}
