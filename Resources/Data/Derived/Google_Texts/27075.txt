The 29th annual Ride The Rockies tour departed Steamboat Springs on Wednesday morning after a two-night stay, which was designed to offer its 2,000 registered cyclists a chance to recover from a taxing first two days.

The Day 4 route Wednesday was familiar to those riders who opted Day 3 to take the “false recovery ride,” which was a 54-mile loop starting and ending in Steamboat Springs. (The first two days were 89 and 95 miles, respectively.) The first 20 miles on Day 3 and Day 4 were identical.

From the 20th mile at Oak Creek, cyclists followed a gradual climb paralleling the Yampa River, affording comfortable travel at miles per hour in the teens as well as scenery of both mountain ranges and rock formations.

The route then led cyclists over State Bridge and a surging Colorado River before a swift descent into the fourth of four aid stations in Wolcott. Next, a gradual climb of 10 miles through Edwards led cyclists to their destination of Avon.

Day 5 of the six-day, 471-mile tour leaves Avon on Thursday for a 74-mile trip to Breckenridge over two mountain passes — Tennessee and Fremont.

The sixth and final day summits Loveland Pass and Lookout Mountain over 77 miles to finish in Golden.
