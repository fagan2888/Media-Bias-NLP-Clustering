Now, some states they can nominate yahoos, and the yahoos will win. But other states, if they nominate yahoos, the Democrat\u2019s likely to win.\u201d\n\nFormer Mitt Romney foreign policy advisor Dan Senor objected to this, noting that the GOP had tamped down on extreme right-wing challengers in many states to nominate more viable general election candidates.\n\n\u201cLook at Tom Cotton in Arkansas and Dan Sullivan in Alaska,\u201d Senor said. \u201cYou just go across the spectrum. In Colorado, we had a crazy right-winger who would have lost the general election. He got out. Suddenly Cory Gardner, who can win, has gotten in.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done a much better job,\u201d Roberts said.\n\nWatch the clip below, via ABC News:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\n[Image via screengrab]\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n>> Follow Evan McMurry (@evanmcmurry) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "During an ABC panel discussion on the 2104 midterms Sunday morning, Cokie Roberts conceded that the GOP has done \"a much better job\" of not electing \"yahoos\" in", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/roberts.jpg", "title": "Cokie Roberts: GOP Has Done \u2018Much Better Job\u2019 of Not Electing \u2018Yahoos\u2019"}, "twitter": {"description": "During an ABC panel discussion on the 2104 midterms Sunday morning, Cokie Roberts conceded that the GOP has done \"a much better job\" of not electing \"yahoos\" in their congressional primaries, bettering their chances in the fall elections.", "title": "Cokie Roberts: GOP Has Done 'Much Better Job' of Not Electing 'Yahoos'", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/roberts.jpg", "creator": "@@evanmcmurry", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2014-03-23T10:59:01+00:00", "keywords": "tv", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Suddenly Cory Gardner, who can win, has gotten in.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve done a much better job,\u201d Roberts said.\nNow, some states they can nominate yahoos, and the yahoos will win.\nDuring an ABC panel discussion on the 2014 midterms Sunday morning, Cokie Roberts conceded that the GOP has done \u201ca much better job\u201d of not electing \u201cyahoos\u201d in their congressional primaries, bettering their chances in the fall elections.\n\u201cThe likelihood is the Republicans take the Senate,\u201d Roberts said on This Week With George Stephanopoulos.\n\u201cBut there are a lot of things that have to happen, and one of them is Republican primaries have to come out the way Republicans want."}
