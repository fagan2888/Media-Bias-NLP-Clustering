That\u2019s the dynamic in Tarrant County, where state Rep. Jonathan Stickland and challenger Scott Fisher are racing toward Tuesday's primary.\n\nAt the heart of the dispute are differences in philosophy and personality.\n\nStickland doesn\u2019t wear his philosophy of government on his sleeve. He wears it on the front of his T-shirt.\n\n\u201cMore freedom and less government,\u201d it says.\n\n\u201cWhen the government is big, the individual is small,\u201d Stickland says. \u201cI really believe in people, and I believe when the government comes in and adds red tape to anything it messes up the system.\u201d\n\nThe 32-year-old oil and gas consultant first ran for office in the district that includes Hurst, Euless and Bedford four years ago. He says he\u2019s kept his promise to do everything he could do limit the government\u2019s influence on people\u2019s lives.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a go along to get along type of situation,\u201d Stickland says. \u201cThere are serious implications on decisions that are being made over the next couple of years, and we need conservative warriors who\u2019re going to go down there and do that.\u201d\n\nStickland has a reputation as something of a bomb thrower in Austin. That\u2019s earned him praise from Tea Party groups and Empower Texans, which supports ultra-conservative candidates and has funded his campaign generously. It also means a thin file of bills introduced and passed.\n\nListen to the KERA News story.\n\n\u201cThe thing that I\u2019ve really hung my hat on as a legislator is not just passing bills. I\u2019ve been concerned with stopping bad legislation,\u201d Stickland says. \u201cI believe that before we get back to constitutional role of government we\u2019ve got to stop the ship that\u2019s sailing down and out of control.\u201d\n\nRice University political scientist Mark Jones says Stickland may well be the member that House leadership would most like to see lose his primary challenge.\n\n\u201cThe level of irritation Stickland provides the leadership team and many members of the Austin lobby is even greater just due to his more enhanced political style and greater presence.\u201d\n\nScott Fisher is the pastor of a Nazarene church in Euless and a former spokesman for Texas Christian Coalition. He also chairs the state\u2019s juvenile justice commission and served on the board of the Tarrant County Hospital District.\n\nFisher says true conservatives believe government should help care for society\u2019s most at risk members \u2013 and do it responsibly, without violating their values.\n\n\u201cThe word conservative has been hijacked by libertarianism,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are conservative Republicans, and there are libertarians who have embraced Republicanism to gain access to the mainstream.\u201d\n\nFisher says there are some things he would never compromise on, like abortion. But he says he wants to get things done.\n\n\u201cIf 100 percent is not possible, do what you can to get the 90,\u201d Fisher says. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll work on that other 10 in steps.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of outside interest and a lot of outside money in this race. Both sides have advertised themselves as the true conservative in the race. Both have accused the other of going negative.\n\nIn television ads, Fisher has attacked Stickland\u2019s public safety record, going after him for votes that would have limited police powers. In mailers, he\u2019s raised questions about online posts Stickland made talking about smoking pot, asking for advice on beating a drug test and saying that rape does not exist in marriage.\n\nStickland has apologized for the comments, and says they reflect the teenager he used to be, and not the man he is today.\n\nStickland has launched ads saying that Fisher called for Texas to expand Medicaid \u2013 a key provision of the Affordable Care Act \u2013 as a board member for the public hospital district in Fort Worth. Politifact investigated and gave that claim its worst \u201cPants on Fire\u201d rating, calling it \u201cincorrect and ridiculous.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes down to it, the question for voters in eastern Tarrant County may be less about who is the true conservative, and more about which kind of conservative they want to represent them.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "Across Texas, insurgent Republicans who rode Tea Party anger to Austin are now facing challenges themselves.
