(AP) - The first leases allowing wind turbines offshore of the Carolinas are expected to be let next year although some still worry the massive turbines could harm tourism upon which coastal communities depend.\n\nConcerns the turbines will spoil views from beaches surfaced again as about 200 people attended three hearings in recent days held by the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.\n\nThe agency has issued a report that there appears to be no significant environmental impact to offshore wind development. It took public comment at hearings in Kitty Hawk, Wilmington and in Carolina Shores on the South Carolina state line.\n\nThe agency has identified three areas for potential leases. One is about 120,000 acres off the Outer Banks while the other two are tracts of 130,000 acres and 52,000 acres south of Wilmington and east of Myrtle Beach, S.C.\n\nThe bureau\u2019s William Waskes told the gathering in Carolina Shores that while leases could be awarded as early as next year, it will probably be well into the next decade before any turbines are built. He said once leases are awarded, there would be additional environmental studies of the specific areas as well as additional reviews of specific turbine construction plans.\n\nAlthough common off Europe, there are currently no offshore wind turbines in the United States. Waskes said construction of the first is expected off New England in the next year or two.\n\nThose attending the hearing Thursday in Carolinas Shores were still worried about the impacts of turbines on tourism and some wondered what\u2019s the point of developing the wind energy at all.\n\n\u201cWhere is the benefit to us?\u201d asked Ron Watts, the mayor of Sunset Beach, North Carolina. \u201cWe see the negative to tourism. We\u2019re not getting anything financially. I don\u2019t see where we get economic development if this energy is cabled into South Carolina or from Kitty Hawk up into Virginia.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re probably affected more by the wind farm than any other location in eastern North Carolina,\u201d added Carol Scott of Sunset Beach. The turbines would be about 12 miles offshore and she worries bigger turbines will be developed in the future.\n\n\u201cOnce you authorize the wind farms then it\u2019s too late for a community to say that new turbine is intolerable,\u201d she warned.\n\nAndy Sayer of Bald Head Island, North Carolina, wondered how the turbines will be lit at night so they will be seen from boats and airplanes. He asked if the power would be used locally but was told developers can cable it wherever they want.\n\nDavid Rogers, the field director for Environment North Carolina said later that developing wind energy makes more sense for coastal communities than continued development of fossil fuels which contribute to sea level rise. He said wind energy will result in a new industry and jobs.\n\nThere is already a wind energy industry on the Carolinas coast. Fifteen months ago, Clemson University opened a new $110 million energy research center in North Charleston, South Carolina, that includes the world\u2019s largest wind turbine test rig.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The first leases allowing wind turbines offshore of the Carolinas are expected to be let next year although some still worry the massive turbines could harm tourism upon which coastal communities depend.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The first leases allowing wind turbines offshore of the Carolinas are expected to be let next year although some still worry the massive turbines could harm tourism upon which coastal communities depend.", "title": "Leases for wind turbines off Carolinas could come in 2016", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/14/leases-for-wind-turbines-off-carolinas-could-come-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/14/b18de893410d1e076e0f6a7067000c91.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/14/b18de893410d1e076e0f6a7067000c91.jpg", "description": "The first leases allowing wind turbines offshore of the Carolinas are expected to be let next year although some still worry the massive turbines could harm tourism upon which coastal communities depe", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Leases for wind turbines off Carolinas could come in 2016"}, "Author": "BRUCE SMITH", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbefb\"", "article_summary": "Although common off Europe, there are currently no offshore wind turbines in the United States.\nIt took public comment at hearings in Kitty Hawk, Wilmington and in Carolina Shores on the South Carolina state line.\nCAROLINA SHORES, N.C.
