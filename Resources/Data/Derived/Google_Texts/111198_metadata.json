They\u2019ve been partnering with groups like Out2Enroll, CenterLink, the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association, PFLAG, the Equality Federation, and the Gay and Lesbian Victory Institute to raise awareness about Obamacare and, this week, produced a list touting the Top 5 reasons why it\u2019s good for the gays.\n\n1. Plans purchased through the Marketplace can\u2019t discriminate based on sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\n2. You can\u2019t be charged a higher premium just because you\u2019re gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender\n\n3. You can\u2019t be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions like HIV/AIDS, cancer or mental-health issues.\n\n4. Legally married same-sex couples are treated equally in regards to financial assistance as heterosexual married couples in the Health Insurance Marketplace, regardless of whether their home state recognizes marriage equality.\n\n5. No lifetime limits on chronic conditions like HIV/AIDS.\n\nThis is exciting stuff \u2013 but many Americans aren\u2019t aware of their new options or that they can sign up for health insurance by December 23 and get coverage by January 1!\n\nThat\u2019s very important info for sure, but the folks at Out2Enroll know that if you want to get a point across to gay men, it doesn\u2019t hurt to have a cute guy in underwear (or several, for that matter). They\u2019ve produced \u201cGet Enrolled,\u201d a Christmas-carol parody to the tune of \u201cLet it Snow.\u201d\n\nOut2Enroll describes itself as \u201ccoalition of organizations who want to help lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people stay healthy by making sure that one of the major benefits of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 access to affordable, comprehensive health insurance coverage \u2014 reaches LGBT communities.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The deadline is December 23, so don't delay!", "og": {"site_name": "LOGO News", "description": "The deadline is December 23, so don't delay!", "title": "White House, Underwear Models Encourage LGBT Community To Enroll In Obamacare: WATCH", "url": "http://www.newnownext.com/white-house-explains-how-obamacare-helps-the-lgbt-community/12/2013/", "image": {"width": 1440, "identifier": "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:uma:image:logotv.com:10688374?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=1440&height=810&.jpg", "height": 810}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newnownext.com/white-house-explains-how-obamacare-helps-the-lgbt-community/12/2013/", "image": "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:uma:image:logotv.com:10688374?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=500&height=375", "description": "The deadline is December 23, so don't delay!", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "White House, Underwear Models Encourage LGBT Community To Enroll In Obamacare: WATCH"}, "sm4": {"category": "News Articles - Life News", "parent": "mgid:wordpress:siteloc:www.newnownext.com:hp", "pubdate": "2013-12-19 12:06:49 PM +0000", "creator": "20D502000002D52000010002D520", "author": "Dan Avery", "alias": "post", "mgid": "mgid:wordpress:post:www.newnownext.com:136661", "type": "post"}, "fb": {"admins": "unset", "app_id": "unset"}, "ao": {"mgid": "mgid:wordpress:post:www.newnownext.com:136661"}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "MTVNVevoHelper": {"beacon": "D4F4BE78-454E-44C3-B142-F9D269B9303E"}, "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/danavery"}, "thumbnail": "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:newnownext.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/out2enroll-300x155.png?quality=0.8&format=jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda393\"", "article_summary": "You can\u2019t be charged a higher premium just because you\u2019re gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender3.\nLegally married same-sex couples are treated equally in regards to financial assistance as heterosexual married couples in the Health Insurance Marketplace, regardless of whether their home state recognizes marriage equality.\nThis is exciting stuff \u2013 but many Americans aren\u2019t aware of their new options or that they can sign up for health insurance by December 23 and get coverage by January 1!\nThe December 23 deadline for the Affordable Care Act is swiftly approaching, and the Obama Administration wants to make sure LGBT people take advantage of it.\nYou can\u2019t be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions like HIV/AIDS, cancer or mental-health issues."}
