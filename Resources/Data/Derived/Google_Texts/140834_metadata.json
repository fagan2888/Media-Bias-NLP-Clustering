Then again, none of the Broncos\u2019 other projected opening-day starters will play against the Cowboys.\n\nThe slot receiver\u2019s recovery, though, is encouraging. He was seen joining the Broncos\u2019 offense in the team\u2019s weightlifting and exercise facility Tuesday and was able to travel Wednesday.\n\nThe Broncos open their season Sept. 7 against the Indianapolis Colts at Sports Authority Field at Mile High \u2014 15 days after Welker suffered his concussion.\n\nWelker caught a 9-yard pass across the middle with seconds to play in the first half of the Broncos\u2019 preseason game Saturday against Houston. Immediately after catching the ball, Welker took a blow to helmet by Houston safety D.J. Swearinger, who received a 15-yard penalty for unnecessary roughness.\n\nWelker walked into the locker room under his own power. It was his third concussion in less than 10 months.\n\nAfter he suffered his first concussion against Kansas City on Nov. 17, Welker returned the next week. After he suffered another concussion in a game Dec.8 against Tennessee, Welker sat out the final three games of the season.\n\nHe returned with a more padded, eggshell-type helmet and caught 18 passes in three postseason games. Welker, 33, was wearing the concussion helmet when he was hit Saturday by Swearinger.\n\nWelker\u2019s 841 catches rank 24th on the NFL\u2019s all-time receptions list. An additional 80 catches would move him past the likes of No. 22 Rod Smith and No. 15 Torry Holt, among others.\n\nMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikeklis", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Wes Welker cleared to travel \u2014 not play \u2014 for Broncos-Cowboys game", "title": "Wes Welker cleared to travel \u2014 not play \u2014 for Broncos-Cowboys game", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/27/wes-welker-cleared-to-travel-not-play-for-broncos-cowboys-game/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131211__wes-welker-broncos-121113bp1-1.jpg", "height": 434}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131211__wes-welker-broncos-121113bp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-27T16:14:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:41:05+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "ARLINGTON, Texas \u2014 Wes Welker was cleared to fly with the Broncos for their final preseason game against the Dallas Cowboys.\nWelker caught a 9-yard pass across the middle with seconds to play in the first half of the Broncos\u2019 preseason game Saturday against Houston.\nWelker has not yet been medically cleared from his concussion to engage in contact, so he won\u2019t play in the game Thursday night at AT&T Stadium.\nAfter he suffered his first concussion against Kansas City on Nov. 17, Welker returned the next week.\nAfter he suffered another concussion in a game Dec.8 against Tennessee, Welker sat out the final three games of the season."}
