According to The New York Times, the Republican front-runner added strategist Paul J. Manafort to his team.\n\nManafort has most recently been known for his international political work \u2014 including his role as a senior adviser to the former president of Ukraine.\n\nBut in years prior, Manafort served as a campaign adviser for Ronald Reagan, George Bush and Bob Dole.\n\nAdding Manafort to the mix could be a sign Trump wants to get serious about clenching delegates to win the Republican nomination.\n\nAnd maybe for good reason. The Wall Street Journal pointed out last week that rival Sen. Ted Cruz seems to be picking up delegates on the way to the party convention.\n\nThe business mogul needs a total of 1,237 delegates to win the bid. As of Monday, The New York Times reports Trump had a total of 738 delegates, while Cruz had a total of 463.\n\nThis video includes clips from Donald J.
