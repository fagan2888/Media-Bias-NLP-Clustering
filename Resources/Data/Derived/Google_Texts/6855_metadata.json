If the Inspector General deems a document necessary to do his job, then the agency should turn it over immediately. The clear command of that law is being ignored far too often by agencies across the executive branch. By this opinion\u2019s tortured logic, \"all records\" does not mean \"all records,\" and Congress\u2019s recent attempt to underscore our original intent with an appropriations restriction is nothing but a nullity. The prospect of the Obama administration using this opinion to stonewall oversight, avoid accountability, and undermine the independence of inspectors general is alarming.\n\nCongressman Bob Goodlatte, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, stated,\n\nToday\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel opinion contains the same kind of outcome-oriented lawyering that produced the Department of Justice\u2019s infamous recess appointments memorandum, which was unanimously rejected by the Supreme Court in 2014. The law is clear that the Office of the Inspector General should have unfettered access to materials for its investigations, but political lawyers at the Department of Justice have engaged in legal gymnastics to shield key information from government watchdogs.\n\nWhat would the Justice Department have to hide?\n\nThe Justice Department is stiff-arming the inspector general\u2019s requests for records relating to several DOJ scandals, including: (1) whether the Department had violated the civil liberties and civil rights of individuals detained in national security investigations following 9/11, (2) Operation Fast and Furious, (3) the FBI\u2019s use of National Security and Exigent letters, (4) the DEA's (Drug Enforcement Administration's) sex parties scandal, (5) the DEA\u2019s use of confidential sources, and (6) the DEA\u2019s use of administrative subpoenas to obtain bulk data collections.\n\nLast February, Horowitz told a congressional committee that \u201cthe FBI has failed to turn over key records in several whistleblower cases,\u201d the Post reports.\n\nThat\u2019s not surprising.\n\nDespite campaign promises to \u201cstrengthen whistleblower laws to protect federal workers who expose waste, fraud, and abuse of authority in government, President Obama has single-handedly prosecuted (and persecuted) more whistleblowers than any of his predecessors.\n\nWith the formal filing of the charges against NSA leaker Edward Snowden, this president has charged eight whistleblowers under the Espionage Act.\n\nOne of the targets of the president\u2019s prosecution and persecution of those he promised to protect was trying to expose the details of the Department of Justice\u2019s \u201cOperation Fast and Furious\u201d gun running program. As reported by The New American in October 2013:\n\nThe Obama administration, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) in particular, are under fire from across the political spectrum again after they were publicly exposed trying to censor a key whistleblower in the Fast and Furious federal gun-running scandal by preventing him from publishing a book about it.\n\nClaiming that publication of ATF Special Agent John Dodson\u2019s manuscript would harm agency morale, official documents show that the out-of-control bureaucracy sought to violate the First Amendment in an apparent effort to avoid further scrutiny of its lawless activities. However, that attempt failed miserably, and the scandal is back in the headlines with a vengeance.\n\nThe Fast and Furious revelations showed, among other deadly serious scandals, that the ATF, disgraced Attorney General Eric Holder\u2019s Justice Department, and other top officials conspired to send thousands of high-powered weapons to Mexican drug cartels at U.S. taxpayer expense. Many of those guns were used to murder Mexican citizens and even U.S. law-enforcement officers. It was later learned from official documents that the supposed \u201cdrug lords\u201d allegedly being \u201cinvestigated\u201d were already on the FBI payroll, and that the administration was plotting to use the Fast and Furious violence to advance its unconstitutional assault on the Second Amendment.\n\nAs for the FBI, that agency has been on a tear through the Fourth Amendment for years.\n\nJust days ago, FBI Director James Comey told the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee that in order to stay a step ahead of the bad guys, the g-men should have access to any available technology to decode encrypted data. And that the government should be the arbiter of when decryption is necessary or not.\n\nLast year, the Obama Justice Department asked that a committee be empaneled to amend Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (FRCP).\n\nIn plain terms, Rule 41 mandates that judges may issue search warrants only within the districts where they have jurisdiction. The FBI wants this restriction removed.\n\nSpecifically, the FBI wants a judge to be able to issue an electronic surveillance warrant authorizing the feds to search the contents of a computer, regardless of where that computer is physically located.\n\nIn an article from April 2013, the Washington Post\u2019s Ellen Nakashima wrote, \u201cDriven by FBI concerns that it is unable to tap the Internet communications of terrorists and other criminals, the task force\u2019s proposal would penalize companies that failed to heed wiretap orders \u2014 court authorizations for the government to intercept suspects\u2019 communications.\u201d\n\nIn that proposal, the FBI would give Internet companies a chance to develop their own plan to place the wiretaps on clients\u2019 online activity. There are limits to this \u201cfreedom,\u201d however.\n\nIf the company\u2019s solution fails to meet federal muster, the FBI would mandate the enforcement of its own surveillance standards and practices.\n\nFinally, at a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee on June 19, 2013, former FBI Director Robert Mueller testified that his agency had used drones to monitor American citizens within the United States.\n\nIn light of all these scandals, it\u2019s no wonder the president wants to take extraordinary steps to stop the inspector general from getting eyes on sensitive, likely inculpating evidence of the Justice Department\u2019s darkest deeds.\n\nPhoto of President Obama: AP Images", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Obama, blocking, inspector general, access, files, Department of Justice, scandals, Fast and Furious, whistleblowers", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/politics/item/21323-obama-blocks-investigator-s-access-to-files-related-to-doj-scandals", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/4f87ac40e3d543534d73f9a482ce32a3_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Obama administration is blocking the inspector general's access to files related to Fast and Furious and other Justice Department scandals.
