ISLAMABAD (AP) — An elderly Pakistani mother made an emotional appeal Saturday for authorities to halt the execution of her son, who was sentenced to death at age 14.

Shafqat Hussain was sentenced in 2004 by a court in the port city of Karachi after it found him guilty of killing another boy.

Hussain’s 87-year-old mother Makhni Begum pleaded with the government to cancel the execution.

In a telephone interview from the Pakistani-controlled section of the disputed Kashmir territory, she insisted that Hussain was innocent.

“I request to the government and I beg to the judiciary to order the retrial of my son. Please spare his life. Don’t snatch him from me,” she sobbed.

The woman said her son went to Karachi to work as a security guard, but one day she heard that he had been arrested in a murder case.

Hussain’s brother Manzoor alleged that his brother was tortured by police to force a confession.

“My brother was subjected to the worst torture for admitting that he had killed another boy and dumped his body” near a drain in Karachi, he said.
