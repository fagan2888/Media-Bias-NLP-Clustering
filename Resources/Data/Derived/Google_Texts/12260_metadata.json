David Remnick, editor of The New Yorker, has now replied. Remnick's letter was reproduced at the Genetic Literacy Project. Selections are below:\n\nThis is in reply to the letter you sent and subsequently posted on the Internet earlier this week. It is not for publication in any way or on your website, but I thought you were asking for a serious reply. So here it is: I should say that since you have said that the entire scientific establishment has been bought and paid for by Monsanto, I fear it will be difficult to converse meaningfully about your accusation that the story contained \u201cfraudulent assertions and deliberate attempts to skew reality.\u201d But maybe I am wrong; I\u2019ll try. ...\n\nOne hardly needs to hold a Ph.D. in physics to become an effective environmental activist, as you have demonstrated. Yet, when a prominent figure, such as yourself, is described for decades\u2014in interviews, on web sites, in award citations, and on many of your own book jackets, as having been \u201cone of India\u2019s leading physicists\u201d it seems fair to ask whether or not you ever worked as one. ...\n\nYour math and conclusions on the issues of farmer suicides and seed prices and values differ from the math in studies carried out by many independent, international and government organizations. Mr. Specter is far from alone in rejecting, based on data, your charge that Monsanto is responsible for \u201cgenocide\u201d in India. In your letter you state that \u201cSpecter promotes a system of agriculture that fails to deliver on its promises of higher yield and lower costs and propagates exploitation.\u201d This has always been your position, but as Mr. Specter pointed out in his article, there have been many studies on the effects of planting BT cotton in India, and on the whole, scientists \u2013 none of whom were connected to Monsanto \u2013have found the opposite to be true. ...\n\nOne of the best recent studies on the economic impact of Bt cotton on farmers found that \u201cBt has caused a 24% increase in cotton yield per acre through reduced pest damage and a 50% gain in cotton profit among smallholders. These benefits are stable; there are even indications that they have increased over time.\u2019\u2019 The researchers also show that Bt cotton adoption has raised consumption expenditures, a common measure of household living standard, by 18% during the 2006\u20132008 period and conclude that Bt cotton has created large and sustainable benefits, which contribute to positive economic and social development in India.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Back in August, The New Yorker ran a terrific profile of the evil anti-biotech charlatan Vandana Shiva that nicely revealed, well, her evilness to the", "title": "The New Yorker Rebuts Bioluddite Disinformationist Vandana Shiva", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/09/02/bioluddite-disinformationist-vandana-shi", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14096866854651.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14096866854651.jpg", "description": "Back in August, The New Yorker ran a\n\nterrific profile of the evil anti-biotech charlatan Vandana\nShiva that nicely revealed, well, her evilness to the world.\nIncensed that her fables were questioned, Shiva attacked using the\ncharacteristic techniques of the Big Lie, implications of racism,\nmisdirection, and more made up data.
