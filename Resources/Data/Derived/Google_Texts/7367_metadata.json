The site, founded in 2007, appeals to just the audience that the administration needs to reach as it seeks out young and healthy people to sign up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nA rep for FunnyorDie.com tells the Erik Wemple Blog that the site\u2019s demographic is 60 percent male with \u201can age demo of 18-34.\u201d It racks up north of 60 million video views per month. Says Susan Etlinger, an analyst with the Altimeter Group: \u201cIf you want to reach young people, you have to go where they are, and where they are is web TV.\u201d\n\nAnd if you want to reach old people, you have to go where they are, and where they are is Fox News. As Gallup reported last year, \u201cnearly two-thirds of Fox News-oriented news consumers are 50 and older, compared with barely a third of CNN-oriented news consumers.\u201d New York Magazine reported in January that Fox News has a median viewer age of 68, eight years higher than CNN and MSNBC.\n\nPerhaps without even intending to, the president has reached the older set with the Galifianakis session. This morning\u2019s edition of \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d for example, replayed a key segment for its viewers. Sure, co-host Brian Kilmeade declared the whole thing \u201cso inappropriate,\u201d but the program replayed Obama saying the following: \u201cHealthcare.gov works great now, and millions of Americans have already gotten health insurance plans and what we want is for people to know that you can get affordable health care.\u201d\n\nLater in the day, on Fox News\u2019s \u201cHappening Now,\u201d the Obama-Galifianakis repartee got another round of re-airing and analysis. And the day\u2019s still young! Who knows what Van Susteren and O\u2019Reilly and Kelly and Hannity have planned for the primetime hours?\n\nKilmeade asked, \u201cShould the president of the United States be doing this online?\u201d If Fox News agrees to share so prodigiously, then yes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If President Obama does something hip and cheeky, Fox News is certain to swarm.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/erik.wemple", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "If President Obama does something hip and cheeky, Fox News is certain to swarm.", "title": "Fox News completes demographic coup for Obamacare", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2014/03/11/fox-news-completes-demographic-coup-for-obamacare/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@ErikWemple"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2014/03/11/fox-news-completes-demographic-coup-for-obamacare/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "President Obama, Fox News, Zach Galifianakas,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/erik.wemple"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "President Obama, Fox News, Zach Galifianakas,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccdcd\"", "article_summary": "Everyone knows why the White House set up an interview for President Obama with Zach Galifianakis on \u201cBetween Two Ferns\u201d on FunnyorDie.com.\nPerhaps without even intending to, the president has reached the older set with the Galifianakis session.\nKilmeade asked, \u201cShould the president of the United States be doing this online?\u201d If Fox News agrees to share so prodigiously, then yes.\nThis morning\u2019s edition of \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d for example, replayed a key segment for its viewers.\nWho knows what Van Susteren and O\u2019Reilly and Kelly and Hannity have planned for the primetime hours?"}
