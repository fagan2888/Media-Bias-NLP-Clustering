Proxmire, Jan. 20, 2016)\n\nDetroit, MI \u2013 President Barack Obama visited Detroit today, making a tour of the Auto Show, visiting Shinola and Jolly Pumpkin, then coming to UAW/GM to deliver a speech to a group that had many auto workers. His speech focused on the results of the auto bailouts and the turnaround of Detroit and the nation, with thanks to the American auto workers.\n\nCheck out the video below to see what President Obama had to say, or skip to the transcript below:\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Hello, Detroit! (Applause.) It\u2019s good to be back in Michigan \u2014 even though it might be just a little cold here. (Laughter.) But I\u2019m from Chicago, so I\u2019m used to it.\n\nA couple people I want to start off by introducing. First of all, Detroit is coming back, and everybody deserves credit for that. But one person who deserves special credit for it is your mayor, Mike Duggan. He\u2019s doing an outstanding job. (Applause.) And we\u2019re very proud of him. You\u2019ve got four outstanding members of Congress. Debbie Dingell. (Applause.) The Dean, John Conyers. (Applause.) Brenda Lawrence. (Applause.) Sandy Levin. (Applause.) We\u2019ve got one of the finest congressmen who ever served, and a great friend of Detroit \u2014 John Dingell is here. (Applause.) There he is.\n\nAnd a dear friend of mine \u2014 we drove over together, and I was just telling my team, when I was running for the United States Senate \u2014 not for the President \u2014 when I was running for the United States Senate, and nobody knew who I was and nobody could pronounce my name \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 the regional leader of the UAW in Illinois was a guy named Dennis Williams. (Applause.) And he was my friend and supporter before just about anybody else out there. And then, when I ran for President, by that time we\u2019d made some great friends in the UAW, and so I just want to say how proud I am to call him a friend. Your UAW president, Dennis Williams. (Applause.)\n\nAnd give it up for Cindy for that outstanding introduction. (Applause.)\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: \u2014 my mom!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s your mom?\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: That\u2019s my mom.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Are you proud of your mom?\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: I\u2019m very proud of my mom!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Oh, look at that. Well, you\u2019re like out of a TV show. What, are you like a child actor, or something? Look at him. He\u2019s all handsome. Yeah. (Laughter.) All right, Cindy, he\u2019s a pretty impressive young man.\n\nI want to pick up briefly on something that Cindy said, and that is just to talk for a second about what\u2019s happening in Flint. I am very proud of what I\u2019ve done as President \u2014 (applause) \u2014 but the only job that\u2019s more important to me is the job of father. And I know that if I was a parent up there, I would be beside myself that my kids\u2019 health could be at risk. And that\u2019s why, over the weekend, I declared a federal emergency in Flint to send more resources on top of the assistance that we\u2019ve already put on the ground. We\u2019ve designated a federal coordinator to make sure the people of Flint get what they need from their country.\n\nYesterday, I met with Mayor Weaver in the White House, in the Oval Office, and I told her that we are going to have her back and all the people of Flint\u2019s back as they work their way through this terrible tragedy. It is a reminder of why you can\u2019t shortchange basic services that we provide to our people and that we, together, provide as a government to make sure that the public health and safety is preserved. (Applause.)\n\nBut I have come to Detroit for another reason, as well. I already drive in a great American car, which we affectionately know as the Beast. (Laughter.) Next year I\u2019ve got to give it up. I\u2019m saying goodbye to the Beast. So I figured that I needed to do a little browsing now at the Detroit Auto Show. I know they\u2019ve got auto shows in Paris and Frankfurt and Tokyo. But there\u2019s only one Motor City. There\u2019s only one Detroit. (Applause.) And if you\u2019re looking for the world\u2019s best cars and the workers who make those cars, you need to be in Detroit, Michigan. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here. (Applause.)\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: CT6!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: He said the GT6 \u2014 CT6. All right.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Get that!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I\u2019m looking at all of them now. (Laughter.)\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.) (Laughter.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: All right, I got the idea. I\u2019m not going to tell you all what I\u2019m buying now. (Laughter.)\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Jeep Grand Cherokee! (Laughter.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Now, I will say, the Cherokee was my first new car I ever bought. (Applause.) Somebody was asking me \u2014 I didn\u2019t get a new car until I was, like, 32. (Laughter.) I always had an old, beat-up hoopty. (Laughter.) But my first brand-new car with the brand-new car smell was a Jeep Cherokee. And I thought I was a bad man once I was in that car. (Laughter.) I was all up high, looking at the road. Man. (Laughter.)\n\nI could not be prouder of this industry and the road that we\u2019ve traveled together. And I\u2019m proud of each and every one of you. Think about what you\u2019ve fought through. It wasn\u2019t that long ago that a crisis that started on Wall Street sparked a great recession on Main Street, and it cost millions of Americans their jobs, their homes, the savings that they had worked a lifetime to build. Nearly one in five autoworkers got a pink slip, laid off from a job in an iconic industry that had been a ticket to the middle class for generations. And across the Midwest, plants closed with little hope of reopening.\n\nSo the American auto industry \u2014 the beating heart of American manufacturing \u2014 was flat-lining. That\u2019s where we were when I took office seven years ago today. The year before I took office, the auto industry had laid off 400,000 people \u2014 400,000. And we had a choice to make.\n\nWith the economy in a freefall, the markets frozen, there were no private companies, there were no private investors who were going to step up and take a chance on you. So we could have kept on handing over billions of taxpayer dollars to automakers, but things didn\u2019t change and it just got worse \u2014 that would have just kicked the can down the road. Or we could have done nothing, thrown in the towel, walked away from this industry entirely. And a lot of folks suggested we do that. They\u2019d deny it later, but that\u2019s what they said at the time.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: But not you! (Applause.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Think about what that would have meant for America. GM and Chrysler would not exist today. Suppliers and distributors that get their business from those companies would have died off. And when that happened, Ford could have gone down, too. Because those supplier chains are vital to all three industries \u2014 or all three companies. Production stopped. Factories shuttered. Proud companies chopped up, sold off for scraps. And all of you, the men and women who built these companies with your hands, would have been hung out to dry.\n\nMore than one million Americans would have lost their jobs at the worst possible time \u2014 not just autoworkers, but the people in communities that depend on you \u2014 the teachers who teach your kids, the small business owners who know your name. Their livelihoods were at stake, as well.\n\nAnd so we decided we\u2019re not going to let that happen, and we came up with another option. In exchange for help, we demanded responsibility. We said that the auto industry would have to truly change, not just pretend like it was changing. The industry retooled, it restructured. Management and labor got together to settle your differences. Everybody put some skin in the game. Everybody sacrificed for the sake and survival of this industry.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t popular. It wasn\u2019t even popular in Detroit. Wasn\u2019t even popular in Michigan. But I said at the time, I didn\u2019t run for President to be popular. I ran for President to do what needed to be done. (Applause.) And I placed my bet on you. And after visiting auto plants across the Midwest, and seeing what you have done firsthand, let me tell you, I\u2019d make that same bet any day of the week. Because today, factories are humming, business is booming, the American auto industry is all the way back \u2014 all the way back. (Applause.)\n\nSeven years ago, auto sales hit a 27-year-low. Last year, they hit an all-time high. Across the country, workers who thought that they\u2019d never make another car again can\u2019t make them fast enough. You guys see it. New shifts are coming on. Big Three are starting to boost wages. Since our plan kicked in, the American auto industry has added more than 640,000 new jobs. And because everybody came together and everybody worked together, not only are you producing more cars, but they\u2019re some of the most high-tech, most fuel-efficient, best-looking cars in the world. They\u2019re designed and engineered and forged and built right here in the United States of America. (Applause.)\n\nAnd because the auto industry came back, that obviously gave the capacity for Detroit to start coming back. So you\u2019ve now cut the city\u2019s unemployment rate by more than half. Folks aren\u2019t writing off Detroit anymore. Starting five years ago, I sent some of my top people across the federal government to help City Hall and ordinary citizens to spark that comeback here in the Motor City. So today you\u2019ve got buses that are running again, streets that are well-lit again, new homes and businesses getting off the ground again. There\u2019s still plenty of work to do, but you can feel the difference. You can feel something special happening in Detroit.\n\nI stopped by a restaurant to have lunch with the mayor and a good friend of mine, Tom, who started Shinola here, and one of you outstanding autoworkers, and an emergency room doctor. What was that restaurant\u2019s name?\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: The Jolly Pumpkin!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: The Jolly Pumpkin. That was tasty stuff. (Laughter.) And then I went over to Shinola \u2014 now, I already have this Shinola watch. It\u2019s a good-looking watch. (Applause.) Made right here. And for you who don\u2019t know the story of Shinola and how it started \u2014 a factory here in Detroit and hiring folks who had never been involved in manufacturing before, and now it\u2019s got over 500 employees and it\u2019s shipping these spiffy-looking watches and bicycles and belts and wallets and purses. It\u2019s some good-looking stuff.\n\nAnd the people who work there \u2014 we were talking about how there was a woman who was homeless, got a job there as a janitor, is now the supervisor of one of the assembly processes over there to make the watches. Completely turned her life around. Well, that\u2019s the story of Detroit when you give people a chance, when you have confidence in what we can do together.\n\nAnd so what\u2019s true of Detroit is true of the country. And that\u2019s part of the reason I came here. I\u2019m shopping for a car \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 but right now, I want people to remember how far we\u2019ve come. And it\u2019s not \u2014 I\u2019m not running for office again. The reason I want to remind people is not because I\u2019m on the ticket; it\u2019s because I want America to have confidence in where we can go. I talked about this at the State of the Union address.\n\nSeven years ago, we put in place new plans to help hardworking families get back on their feet. We put folks back to work rebuilding roads and bridges. We passed big, new middle-class tax cuts. We asked the wealthiest Americans, who were doing fine, even through the recession, to pay a little bit more, pay their fair share. We rethought our health care system. We reinvented our energy sector. We put in place the toughest Wall Street reforms in history. And today, businesses like this one have added more than 14 million new jobs. This has been the longest streak of job creation in our history \u2014 in our history. (Applause.)\n\nThe United States of America, right now, has the strongest, most durable economy in the world. We\u2019re doing so much better than other folks are doing. The American economy right now is 10 percent bigger than it was at its peak, before the financial crisis. In Europe, it hasn\u2019t gotten back to where it was back in 2007-2008.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you, Mr. President! (Applause.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: We\u2019ve added more jobs than almost all the other advanced countries combined during this period.\n\nSo when you hear people \u2014 I won\u2019t say who \u2014 but when you hear people claiming that America is in decline, they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. They\u2019re peddling fiction during a political season. And it\u2019s strange to watch people try to outdo each other in saying how bad things are. When one says our economy is terrible, the next says it\u2019s terrible and on fire, and covered in bees. (Laughter.) And they\u2019ll just come up with stuff. They\u2019re racing to see who can talk down America the most.\n\nBut remember \u2014 and this is why I want everybody to remember \u2014 these are the same folks who would have let this industry go under. (Applause.) These are some of the same folks who back in Washington called our plan to save the auto industry \u201cthe road to socialism;\u201d said it was going to be a \u201cdisaster;\u201d said \u201cthey\u2019ll run it into the ground.\u201d Those are quotes, by the way. I\u2019m not making that up. Look it up. And so when I hear, today, some of these folks running for President, who can\u2019t bring themselves to admit what you guys have accomplished, I don\u2019t want you to take that seriously. Because when you ignore the progress we\u2019ve made, then you\u2019re not going to make good choices about where we need to go in the future. (Applause.)\n\nIf they\u2019re still trying to spin a tale that the auto rescue was a bad idea, the same folks who predicted that you\u2019d fail, they had other predictions about policies, too. They predicted gas prices would hit $6.50 a gallon. I don\u2019t know what you all are paying right now, but it ain\u2019t no $6.50. (Applause.) In most places, it\u2019s $2.00 or less. On the way here, we saw gas for less than two bucks. But that\u2019s what they said \u2014 it\u2019s going to be $6.50.\n\nThen they predicted all the deficits are going to go way, way up. We cut our deficits by almost three quarters. (Applause.) They\u2019ve been below average for the past 40 years. They said we\u2019ll get unemployment to 6 percent by 2016. Well, we got it down to five about a year ahead of schedule \u2014 of their schedule.\n\nThis is the crowd that was dead set against betting on you and your hard work, and your professionalism and your skills. They\u2019ve somehow still convinced themselves that cutting taxes for folks at the very top is going to help you succeed. I think there\u2019s a better plan. By the way, they said when we raise taxes on the folks at the very top who had been doing great, they said, oh, well, that\u2019s going to kill jobs. And guess what \u2014 70 months straight of job creation now. (Applause.) Just like they said when Obamacare passed \u2014 oh, that\u2019s going to be terrible \u2014 18 million people with health insurance who didn\u2019t have it before. (Applause.)\n\nSo, now, this is not to make an argument for complacency. I\u2019m not suggesting we should be satisfied where we are. Because what is true is, the economy has been changing in profound ways for the last 20, 30 years. You\u2019ve all seen it. Technology has made it easier to replace jobs on the assembly line. That\u2019s been going on for a long time. Any job where work can be automated is in danger of being replaced. The attacks on unions have been going on for a long time. And when union participation is down, workers have less leverage to get a raise. (Applause.)\n\nThe fact that companies can move because of increased technology means more global competition. And all these trends have squeezed workers, even when they\u2019ve got jobs, even when the economy is growing \u2014 which means that a lot of Americans sometimes feel anxious. And that tells us we\u2019ve got more work to do. But as I said at the State of the Union, if we\u2019re going to solve those problems for working families and middle-class families, for your neighbors, for your friends, for your kids, your grandkids, then we\u2019ve got to have smart answers \u2014 not just a bunch of fantasies that end up helping the folks who don\u2019t need help.\n\nIn this economy, we got to make sure that everybody who works hard has a chance at opportunity and security. And real opportunity in this new economy means every American has got to get the education and training they need to land a good-paying job. I know that any of your fathers or grandfathers who worked in an auto plant, they wouldn\u2019t recognize a plant today. It\u2019s just entirely different. And you\u2019ve got to know computers and you\u2019ve got to have skills that didn\u2019t even exist a generation ago. So that means that we\u2019ve got to really make sure our kids are properly trained.\n\nAnd the good news is, last year our high school graduation rate reached another all-time high. And we\u2019ve got to build on that progress with early childhood education for every child that needs it so they get a good start, and computer and math classes to make kids job-ready in this new economy. And we should recruit and support and pay properly great teachers for our kids. (Applause.) We\u2019ve got to make college affordable for every American. And college doesn\u2019t mean necessarily a four-year degree. It might mean a community college. It might mean a technical school. But you\u2019re going to need more than just high school, which is why I\u2019ve laid out a plan to provide two years of community college at no cost for every responsible student. (Applause.) I\u2019m going to fight to get that done, to get that moving this year. (Applause.)\n\nThen we\u2019ve got to think about real security. Now, this is a union facility. So you know the importance of secure health benefits and secure retirement benefits. But not everybody in this new economy has that. So real security in this new economy, in addition to encouraging workers to join together so they have a voice and some leverage, also means benefits and protections you can count on.\n\nWhen Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever, we shouldn\u2019t weaken Social Security and Medicare, we should strengthen Social Security and Medicare. (Applause.) For Americans that are short of retirement, benefits should be mobile, like everything else. That\u2019s what we did with the Affordable Care Act. The idea with the Affordable Care Act was not to replace employer-based care. But it was to say if you lost your job \u2014 as some of you did \u2014 and you tried to buy it on COBRA, and it was so expensive you couldn\u2019t even think about it; or if you decided you wanted to go back to school for more training; or let\u2019s say you decided you wanted to start a new business \u2014 you had a chance to still get some coverage at a reasonable price and good quality. And, as I said, 18 million people have gained coverage so far.\n\nSo now we should make sure that when folks lose their job, the system works for them. For example, they should be able to get unemployment insurance that encourages retraining for a business that\u2019s ready to hire. And if a new job doesn\u2019t pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that folks, if they take a job with the hope of retraining and ultimately getting a better job, in the meantime they can still pay their bills. (Applause.) And if you take a part-time job or a temporary job before you get to find that full-time job, you\u2019d have some insurance, some cushion. And when folks are going from job to job, they should still be able to save for retirement and take their savings with them. See, all that would make this new economy work better for everybody.\n\nEven as we work to secure real opportunity and security for working families, we\u2019ve also got to make sure that the system is not rigged against working families. Now, GM, Ford, Chrysler \u2014 those are all great companies. Shinola is a great company. I believe in private enterprise. I believe in the incredible dynamism of the American economy, and that\u2019s business. And America\u2019s business is business. We love business.\n\nBut after years of corporate profits, we also have to make sure that business is sharing what it makes with the workers who make it. (Applause.) That\u2019s the American way. Henry Ford used to talk about, I\u2019ve got to pay my workers enough so they can buy my cars. That\u2019s good for business. And so working families are not going to get more opportunity or bigger paychecks by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds write their own rules and do whatever they want. You\u2019re not helping middle-class families by allowing a tax on collective bargaining to go unanswered. And I\u2019m not going to back down on my belief that we\u2019ve got to have strong rules to protect the air that our kids breathe and the water that they drink. It is more important than ever. (Applause.)\n\nAnd, by the way, I should just point out that the auto industry here in the United States has figured out that we can make more fuel-efficient cars that reduce the carbon pollution that\u2019s causing climate change, and make a profit, and put more people to work. There\u2019s no contradiction between creating jobs and economic growth and caring for the environment.\n\nAnd in this new economy, workers and parents and startups and small businesses, they need more of a voice, not less. So this year, I\u2019m going to lift up some of the businesses who have figured this out \u2014 what it means to do right by your workers and the fact that that\u2019s good for your bottom line. A lot of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative and our most innovative. And in this new economy is that spirit of creativity and innovation that we need more than ever.\n\nSo you got to be thinking about the future, not just the past. And that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing here in Detroit. You\u2019re not just making cars that people want today, you\u2019re thinking about cars that people are going to want tomorrow. When I was over at the auto show, I saw plug-in hybrids and electrics and fuel-efficient cars that can protect our planet, save people money at the pump. You\u2019re working on self-driving cars that one day could prevent accidents and save lives. This year, my administration is going to take steps to get more of those cars on the road. Right here at GM and UAW, we\u2019re teaming up to train American workers for the good-paying jobs of the future. (Applause.)\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of spirit that\u2019s going to lead us forward, that says we\u2019re all in it together, we\u2019ve all got a stake in each other\u2019s success. It doesn\u2019t always get a lot of attention. But all across this country, if you just look for it, all kinds of good things are happening. And all the division and yelling and rudeness and controversy that gets spun up and manufactured \u2014 that\u2019s not who we are. That\u2019s not how we live on a day-to-day basis. At your workplace, everybody is on the same team trying to get the job done. You might have a disagreement; you try to figure it out. You don\u2019t start shouting. You don\u2019t start saying, well, I like those kind of people but not those kind of folks.\n\nAnd, by the way, the UAW, part of the reason it succeeded was it was one of the first unions to realize that we\u2019re all in this together, and didn\u2019t divide people up. (Applause.) You look at the history of the UAW \u2014 (applause) \u2014 it was one of the first unions to say, no, we\u2019re going to take everybody. If you\u2019re working hard, if you\u2019re doing the right thing, trying to raise your family, we\u2019re going to be better off if we\u2019re hand in hand trying to make sure workers get a fair deal \u2014 even if we don\u2019t look like each other, even if we don\u2019t all worship at the same place. (Applause.) That\u2019s what built the UAW. That\u2019s what built America. (Applause.) That\u2019s what built America. (Applause.)\n\nBut I see it all across the country. I see it in the Leathers family from Sterling Heights. So, Steve Leathers \u2014 I just want to tell a quick story here \u2014 works for a company called Empire Wire and Supply. And during the crisis, they had to lay off nearly 20 percent of their workers. So Steve\u2019s friends were losing their jobs. His neighbors were losing their homes. So one night, he tells his wife if things didn\u2019t get better, they might have to leave, too.\n\nSteve didn\u2019t know it at the time, but his 13-year-old daughter, Brianna, heard what he said \u2014 because, I\u2019ve discovered, kids hear everything. So you all got to watch what you say around your kids. They\u2019ll repeat it back to you \u2014 sometimes 10 years later. (Laughter.) So without telling her dad, Brianna sat down and she wrote me a letter. Thirteen years old. She said, \u201cDear President Obama, I am 13 years old, and I am worried about my family\u2019s future in Michigan. My dad,\u201d she wrote, \u201cworks for a company that manufactures cables for the automotive companies. This industry isn\u2019t doing so well, but these guys are still doing okay.\u201d\n\nSo Brianna is here today. Where\u2019s Brianna? There you are, right there. She\u2019s older now. (Applause.) So Brianna is 13 years old now \u2014 or she\u2019s 19 years old now. This was six years ago. She\u2019s a young lady. She\u2019s working her way through Macomb Community College. Her twin brother, Brendan \u2014 is that Brendan right next to her? He\u2019s at Oakland University, a half hour away. Dad is still in Michigan \u2014 that\u2019s dad. But today, Steve\u2019s future is very different.\n\nBut before the crisis, Steve\u2019s company had about 110 employees. Today, they\u2019ve got nearly 200. (Applause.) Brianna says \u2014 she\u2019s looking back and she says, \u201cI remember a lot of people getting laid off. They all have jobs now.\u201d Steve remembers what it was like back then, there was a panic. Now, he says, I\u2019m 110 percent confident we\u2019re going in the right direction.\n\nNow, Steve and his family, they\u2019re just one example. But those stories are multiplying all across the country. We don\u2019t hear a lot about them. They don\u2019t get on TV. You won\u2019t always read about them in the newspapers. Sometimes we take it for granted.\n\nBut I remember. And I read Brianna\u2019s letters. And that\u2019s why I\u2019ve got so much confidence in the future \u2014 because of you. I know that we\u2019ve got young students like Brianna and Brendan. I know we\u2019ve got workers like Steve who have proven that we\u2019re tougher than any kind of times that we might face. I\u2019m confident because every one of you who clock in every day and work as hard as you can, not just for your own sake, but for the sake of this industry, and for the sake of the country, and because you take pride in what you do. And when you see that car rolling down the highway and you know, hey, I built that thing \u2014 (applause) \u2014 and you know it\u2019s a great product, and it gives you a sense of being part of something bigger \u2014 that makes me confident about the future.\n\nI\u2019m hopeful about our future because of every single American that I\u2019ve met who never stopped believing that the people who love this country can change it for the better. You are what makes America great. And I want you to know that I have faith in you. And when I leave this office, I\u2019ll still have faith in you. (Applause.) And every day that I have the privilege of holding this office, I\u2019m going to have faith in you.\n\nAnd we\u2019re going to work side by side to make sure more folks got jobs, and more folks got better wages and benefits, and more people have the ability to join a union when they want to, and more people are able to start businesses, and more people have health benefits, and more companies are thriving. And this country is going to keep on moving forward. And I know it\u2019s going to happen because of you.\n\nThank you, Detroit. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you.
