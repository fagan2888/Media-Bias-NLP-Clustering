True, the vast majority should not purchase health insurance on the exchanges. But unless they are enrolled in a private Medicare Advantage managed care plan that already includes dental benefits, Medicare beneficiaries are legally permitted to purchase dental plans on the exchanges.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing in the Affordable Care Act that prohibits the sale to Medicare beneficiaries of standalone dental plans on the exchanges,\u201d said Leslie Fried, policy and programs director at the National Council on Aging in Washington, D.C.\n\nStill, there are drawbacks. The standalone dental plans for adults can set annual dollar limits on coverage and don\u2019t have to comply with caps on out-of-pocket spending mandated by the A.C.A. for health plans. Insurance premium subsidies and assistance with out-of-pocket expenses are not available. And in some states, exchange dental plans can reject adult applicants because of pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe choices vary dramatically by state.\n\nIn the 36 states where the federal government is running exchanges, dental coverage is available only to those who also buy health coverage, said an official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency operating those exchanges. That means someone with Medicare cannot purchase standalone dental coverage, even though federal law allows the sale of these policies to Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nThe Maryland Health Connection offers 20 dental-only policies that seniors who have Medicare can buy, said Danielle Davis, communications director for the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange. But Covered California, that state\u2019s insurance exchange, offers stand-alone dental plans that cover only children. Adult coverage may be added next year.\n\nNew York officials announced in August that the state\u2019s exchange would sell 10 dental plans, but now say the policies are wrapped into health plans and are not offered \u00e0 la carte.\n\n\u201cThe need for separate adult dental policies was not raised during public forums about New York\u2019s exchange benefits package,\u201d said Lisa Sbrana, counsel to the N.Y. State of Health exchange. \u201cWe would definitely consider it if New Yorkers expressed an interest in it.\u201d\n\nIn the District of Columbia, seniors in Medicare can choose from five stand-alone dental plans in DCHealthLink, said Mila Kofman, executive director of the District of Columbia Health Exchange Authority, \u201cbut all also include coverage for children.\u201d\n\nThese plans cannot turn away applicants because of pre-existing conditions, but dental plans sold outside the exchange can, said assistant insurance commissioner Philip Barlow. That\u2019s not true everywhere, however.\n\nSo what\u2019s the bottom line?\n\nMedicare beneficiaries may be able buy standalone dental plans on certain state exchanges; however, they may not be much better than those available outside the exchanges. Many standalone exchange dental plans include coverage for children, which seniors don\u2019t need, and that can increase the premiums. If your state exchange does sell dental-only plans and you have Medicare, don\u2019t expect financial assistance.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131101115741, "BN": "newoldage", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "newoldage", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/newoldage/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "November 1, 2013", "keywords": "Elder Care,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Medicare,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Finances & Legalities", "GBLC": "Finances & Legalities", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/newoldage/Dental Coverage on the Insurance Exchanges ( 20131101 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Susan Jaffe", "SCG": "newoldage", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Susan Jaffe", "byl": "Susan Jaffe", "twitter": {"description": "Some adults with Medicare may be able to buy dental coverage on the new insurance exchanges, but there are many drawbacks.", "title": "Dental Coverage on the Insurance Exchanges", "url": "http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/01/dental-coverage-on-the-insurance-exchanges/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/01/science/dental/dental-thumbLarge.jpg", "site": "@TheNewOldAge", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000002529794, "description": "Some adults with Medicare may be able to buy dental coverage on the new insurance exchanges, but there are many drawbacks.", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "November 1, 2013", "article": {"tag": "Finances & Legalities", "published_time": 1383321461, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2013-11-01T15:57:41-04:00"}, "utime": 20131101155741, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20131101, "pdate": 20131101, "des": "Elder Care;Health Insurance and Managed Care;Medicare;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/01/science/dental/dental-thumbLarge.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "The New Old Age Blog", "description": "Some adults with Medicare may be able to buy dental coverage on the new insurance exchanges, but there are many drawbacks.", "title": "Dental Coverage on the Insurance Exchanges", "url": "http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/01/dental-coverage-on-the-insurance-exchanges/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/01/science/dental/dental-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/01/dental-coverage-on-the-insurance-exchanges/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Dental Coverage on the Insurance Exchanges", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/01/science/dental/dental-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9664\"", "article_summary": "Many standalone exchange dental plans include coverage for children, which seniors don\u2019t need, and that can increase the premiums.\nBut Covered California, that state\u2019s insurance exchange, offers stand-alone dental plans that cover only children.\nIn the 36 states where the federal government is running exchanges, dental coverage is available only to those who also buy health coverage, said an official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency operating those exchanges.\nMedicare beneficiaries may be able buy standalone dental plans on certain state exchanges; however, they may not be much better than those available outside the exchanges.\nThat means someone with Medicare cannot purchase standalone dental coverage, even though federal law allows the sale of these policies to Medicare beneficiaries."}
