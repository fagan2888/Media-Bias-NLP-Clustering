NEW YORK (AP) - For all the New Yorkers facing the task of digging their parked cars out from piles of snow, Mayor Bill de Blasio has a message: Don’t.

De Blasio says New York City residents should leave their cars where they are if they can. He doesn’t want people to put the snow from their vehicles back into the streets while the city is trying to clear up from the blizzard.

The city has suspended its alternate-side parking rules through Monday, Feb. 1, so people won’t have to move their cars. Vehicles currently parked next to schools in no standing school hour zones are allowed to remain there until Wednesday, Jan. 27.
