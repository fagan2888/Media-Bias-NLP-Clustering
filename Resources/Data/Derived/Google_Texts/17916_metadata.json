Supposedly.\n\nMany in the so-called Republican establishment worry that Trump will lead the Republican Party to defeat and perdition. On Thursday, former New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman called Trump evil and suggested, \u201cRepublicans, now is the time to defeat this scourge of our party. We can make America great again by defeating the selfishness, arrogance and bigotry of Donald Trump.\u201d Meanwhile, the Jeb Bush campaign reportedly is considering whether their candidate should openly vow not to support Trump if he gets the nomination.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nMost of the establishment, however, seems to be realizing that the field must be culled to beat Trump. Trump will not fall to earth; he will stay right where he is in the polls. The only way to defeat him, then, is to overcome his numbers\u2014his 30-40 percent national numbers are stable, and the only way to beat him would be for the field to consolidate, putting one other candidate at 35-45 percent.\n\nThere\u2019s only one problem for the establishment: The only candidate capable of overcoming Trump\u2019s numbers is the candidate they hate second-most, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX).\n\nThe establishment can\u2019t stand Cruz because they believe he unfairly rips establishment Republicans for insufficient ideological purity. They think Cruz doesn\u2019t understand the necessary deals that must be cut in politics in order to \u201cget things done\u201d\u2014they think he\u2019s more interested in posturing than in achieving practical policies to help Americans.\n\nThey will have to put such concerns aside if they want to defeat Trump. The establishment will never be able to convince grassroots conservatives to consolidate around their favorite, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), over Cruz; grassroots conservatives don\u2019t trust Rubio on immigration, and his close association with the establishment does him no favors. So Cruz isn\u2019t going anywhere in this race. And even if Cruz were to drop in the polls, much of his support would likely drip back to Trump. But were the establishment to back Cruz, Rubio would drop away\u2014and Cruz would suddenly top the polls by a long shot.\n\nWithout the grassroots conservatives now in the Cruz camp, Rubio has no shot of defeating Trump. That\u2019s not merely because of the presence of well-funded establishment alternatives like former Governor Jeb Bush (R-FL) and Governor Chris Christie (R-NJ), who seem to be slowing Rubio\u2019s rise. It\u2019s because, even if you consolidated their support behind Rubio, Rubio would still trail in swing states beyond Iowa and New Hampshire, where enough candidates will certainly remain to stifle Rubio. Rubio would lose South Carolina even if all the other candidates but Trump and Cruz dropped out. And he can\u2019t wait until Florida for a big win. That didn\u2019t work for Rudy Giuliani in 2008, and it won\u2019t work for Rubio now.\n\nSo why doesn\u2019t the establishment get behind Cruz?\n\nTo do so would be to acknowledge that they can\u2019t control the grassroots any longer.\n\nThe Trump phenomenon has been a grassroots response, not to Democrats, but to Republican \u201cinsiders.\u201d In fact, it\u2019s precisely the establishment\u2019s distaste for conservatives like Cruz that opened the door to Trump in the first place. Cruz is popular among grassroots conservatives who believe that the establishment would rather cut deals with President Barack Obama than use the tools at their disposal, including Congress\u2019 power of the purse; they believe that the establishment got moderates John McCain and Mitt Romney to the nominations in 2008 and 2012 over grassroots objections.\n\nThat sentiment, taken to its extreme, becomes support of Trump, not Cruz\u2014Trump is the ultimate outsider, the ultimate slap at the establishment. That\u2019s why Rubio\u2019s establishment-backing is his greatest drawback.\n\nAnd so the establishment now has a choice. If it banks on Trump losing to an establishment candidate like Rubio, it will likely come up short. If it banks on an open convention, Trump could go third party, and many of his supporters would certainly follow him. Or the Republican establishment could make the choice to hold their collective nose and back Cruz.\n\nIf they did that, perhaps at the very least the grassroots would begin to trust establishment Republicans as principled rather than as sellouts who preach conservatism while undermining the most conservative candidate in the race.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The establishment GOP believes it must stop Donald Trump.
