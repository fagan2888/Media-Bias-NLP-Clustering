Santa won't have any trouble getting around this year. (Video via Broadway Video / 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer')\n\nNASA says for the first time since 1977, there will be a full moon to light the way on December 25.\n\nThe last full moon of the year is called the Full Cold Moon, but it's very rare for it to drop in on Christmas. Thanks to longer and darker nights, they are some of the brightest you can see.\n\nIf you want to get the full effect, head outside at 6:11 AM Eastern time to catch the rare event in person.\n\nAnd don't worry, Rudolph isn't out of a job yet. NASA says this won't happen again until 2034.
