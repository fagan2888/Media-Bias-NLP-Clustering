Local mandates like the one the board of health put forth unravel that uniformity. They are also placing an overly onerous and costly burden on New York\u2019s restaurants that are already grappling with rising operating costs under the drastic actions of Governor [Andrew] Cuomo\u2019s wage board.\"\n\n\"We're confident that the courts, if there is a lawsuit, will uphold the Board's authority to pass this rule,\" Chris Miller, a health department spokesman, said in a statement.\n\nNew York City is the first jurisdiction in the country to require sodium warnings, and the health department expects it will apply to 10 percent of all menu items.\n\nBassett, who has made reducing health inequalities a centerpiece of her agenda, has stated that black and Latino populations in New York consume more sodium than whites, leading to greater risk for heart disease and, ultimately, shorter life spans.\n\n\"This information will be particularly useful to a population that is already excessively burdened by cardiovascular disease because not only is the sodium intake higher, but the blood pressure levels in the black population are also substantially higher,\" Bassett said after the board approved the rule.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Politico PRO", "description": "<p>The National Restaurant Association plans to file a lawsuit against New York City's health department over its requirement that chain restaurants post warning labels on foods that contain more than the recommended daily limit for sodium.</p>", "title": "Restaurant group to sue NYC over sodium rule", "url": "http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2015/11/restaurant-group-to-sue-nyc-over-sodium-rule-028537", "image": "http://static.politico.com/capny/sites/default/files/a%20-%20fries_0.png", "type": "article"}, "description": "<p>The National Restaurant Association plans to file a lawsuit against New York City's health department over its requirement that chain restaurants post warning labels on foods that contain more than the recommended daily limit for sodium.</p>", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "| AP Photo/Roberto Pfeil Restaurant group to sue NYC over sodium ruleThe National Restaurant Association plans to file a lawsuit against New York City's health department over its requirement that chain restaurants post warning labels on foods that contain more than the recommended daily limit for sodium.\nThat's no different than what the board is doing with the sodium warning, the restaurant association argued during the rule's public comment period.\nIn 2012, when the city's Board of Health passed a rule limiting the size of sugary drinks, the National Restaurant Association, along with many others, sued to block the regulation.\nThe looming legal battle is reminiscent of fights between restaurants and the Bloomberg health department, which banned trans-fats and imposed calorie menus.\n\"We're confident that the courts, if there is a lawsuit, will uphold the Board's authority to pass this rule,\" Chris Miller, a health department spokesman, said in a statement."}
