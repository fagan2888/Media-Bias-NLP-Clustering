It started airing the day after the primary election. Brownback won the Republican nomination by a smaller margin than most predicted. Little-known Jennifer Winn received 37 percent of the vote against Brownback. Some political experts say that's a sign Brownback's road to a second term could be more difficult than expected.\n\nThe ad ends with: \"Paul Davis. Don't delegate Kansas to an Obama Liberal.\"\n\nIn response to the ad, the Davis campaign released this statement:\n\nWeeks after more than 100 current and former Republican officials endorsed his opponent, and just hours after losing nearly 40 percent of Kansas Republican primary votes to a virtually unknown opponent, Sam Brownback and his outside groups rushed to distract Kansans from the Governor's failed experiment by attacking Paul Davis.\n\nIt's clear Sam Brownback is in trouble and the Republican Governors Association knows it,\" said Davis campaign spokesman Chris Pumpelly. \"On the same day a second credit agency downgraded the Kansas bond rating and the day after a weak primary performance, Sam Brownback and his big money allies again try to distract from his dismal record and blame others for his failed experiment.\n\n\"The governor continues to dodge responsibility for the mess he has created in Kansas. It's clear he'll blame just about anything on the President: be it a weak primary performance or the latest in a string of bad news about the Kansas economy. It's time the Governor stop misleading voters and take responsibility for our struggling schools and stagnant economy.\"\n\nNot only was the state credit rating downgraded for the second time in three months, but Kansas is one of only five states in the country to have lost jobs in the last six months. In contrast, Missouri has gained over 18,000 jobs since the end of last year.\n\nRGA is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars for the ad to air for four weeks in Wichita and other cities across the state.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The general election is still three months away but political ads are already starting up again.", "language": "english", "author": "Madeline Anderson", "og": {"description": "The general election is still three months away but political ads are already starting up again.", "title": "GOP governors' group attacks Kan.
