One recent report said the call center also has struggled to answer customer calls, directing them instead to send requests by email -- and the system has taken months to enroll some people after they signed up.\n\n\u201cWe saw this coming years ago. We were promised that by having a state exchange, the customer would have a far superior experience compared to the federal level, and that\u2019s proven to be false,\u201d said Wayne Hoffman, the CEO of the Idaho Freedom Foundation who has opposed the Idaho state exchange from the start. He said they were warned that under the federal exchange, customers might \u201chave to wait months and months for forms to be returned to them, yet, that is exactly the same experience people in Idaho are having today.\u201d\n\nYour Health Idaho, meanwhile, is blaming Washington -- saying the reason for the delay in tax forms was faulty information they received from the federal government.\n\nThe problems in Idaho mark the latest turbulence for the health care overhaul. UnitedHealth, the nation\u2019s largest health insurer, is projecting millions in losses and recently announced it plans to cut participation in the insurance exchanges to just a handful of states next year; many of the so-called co-ops established under the law have gone belly up; and insurers now are expected to seek steep premium increases for next year to offset financial problems.\n\nThe state-run exchanges, meanwhile, did not all suffer the high-profile embarrassment brought by the troubled roll-out of the federal HealthCare.gov. Some, like Idaho\u2019s, previously performed relatively well. Overall, $4.86 billion was awarded to the states for planning and establishing their own state exchanges.\n\nYet, a number of state-run exchanges \u2013 now including Idaho\u2019s \u2013 have run into operational and technological issues. Oregon\u2019s exchange reportedly came under federal investigation over allegations the state showed the federal government a misleading website demonstration to ensure the continued flow of federal money.\n\nThe FBI would not confirm to Fox News whether an investigation into Oregon\u2019s system, which later switched over to the federal exchange, is ongoing.\n\n\u201cThere are moderate successes that you can attribute to some of these exchanges where people can purchase plans, but generally speaking, it\u2019s a flawed system,\u201d Charles Siler, media relations director of the Foundation for Government Accountability, told Fox News. \u201cIt is nearly impossible to make it work in the long-term.\u201d\n\nIn Idaho, the exchange enrolled about 100,000 people for 2016. But, as first reported by the Idaho Statesman, the exchange was late in sending thousands of residents their tax-subsidy statements.\n\nThe exchange has admitted there was a delay in processing customers\u2019 1095-A forms \u2013 while blaming the federal government for bad information. Approximately 5,000 people experienced delays in their 1095-A forms, but YHI was able to get their consumers the correct forms ahead of the federal tax filing deadline.\n\nAccording to Your Health Idaho, their marketplace technology is now running smoothly.\n\n\u201cYour Health Idaho built an exchange that has and will continue to give Idahoans choice for health insurance and keep maximum control in our state,\u201d Executive Director of Your Health Idaho Pat Kelly told Fox News. \u201cWe regret any trouble this caused our customers.\u201d\n\nYHI has the second-highest enrollment per capita of all the state exchanges, and, as a predominantly conservative state, Idaho is working to maintain maximum control and avoid transitioning to the federal marketplace.\n\nThe decision to pursue a state exchange at all was made after the state\u2019s governor in 2012 appointed several people to a panel to formally evaluate whether the state should create an independent exchange. Idaho was ultimately granted $69 million in federal funding for their exchange.\n\n\u201cYou have the same problems you would have at the federal level \u2013 just with Idaho bureaucrats instead of Washington, D.C., bureaucrats,\u201d Hoffman, who was on that panel and opposed the exchange, said.\n\nKelly told Fox News that funding is not a concern, and they currently have $5 million in reserves, saying: \u201cWe will continue to dedicate the necessary resources to adequately address our customers\u2019 needs.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"prism.subsection1": "state-local",
