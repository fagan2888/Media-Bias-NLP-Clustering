The IMF says the world is potentially sleepwalking into an economic crisis as investors lose faith in the ability of policymakers, CNBC's Julia Chatterley reports.

Negative interest rates have helped boost demand and supported stable prices by supplementing conventional monetary stimulus, senior experts at the International Monetary Fund said in a paper.

The Bank of Japan became the latest central bank to start charging commercial banks for the privilege of parking their excess funds earlier this year. The bank joined counterparts in the euro zone and Switzerland in slashing interest rates below zero in an effort to shake up its sclerotic economy and push up feeble inflation.

In the paper, the IMF's Jose Vinals, Simon Gray and Kelly Eckhold noted that wholesale interest rates have declined while credit growth in the euro zone has also picked up since the move by the European Central Bank to adopt negative rates, although they cautioned that it might be too early to draw definitive conclusions.
