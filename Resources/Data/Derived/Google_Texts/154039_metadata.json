Another Pint Please, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0\n\nA San Francisco Costco has recalled 39,755 lbs. of Foster Farms rotisserie chicken products after at least one person was sickened by Salmonella Heidelberg, the foodborne pathogen that has sickened 317 people in a 20-state outbreak, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).\n\nFSIS investigators discovered possible contamination in Kirkland Signature Foster Farms rotisserie chickens, Kirkland Farm rotisserie chicken soup, leg quarters, and chicken salad sold between Sept. 11 and Sept. 23 at the Costco on 1600 El Camino Real.\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear how the Costco chicken caused illness in one victim because all Costco chicken is cooked to at least 180\u00b0F, Craig Wilson, the wholesale store\u2019s vice president for food safety, told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cIt was well-cooked,\u201d he said. This particular Costco roasts 1,000 chickens a day \u2014 much more in comparison to other stores. \u201cIt may have been a very, very uncommon cross-contamination issue,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWe\u2019re still researching.\u201d\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that chicken should be cooked to a temperature of at least 165\u00b0F in order to kill any foodborne bacteria. In a statement, the FSIS reminded consumers that following the package\u2019s instructions with regards to cooking time doesn\u2019t mean that the chicken is cooked, and that a thermometer should be used to check internal temperature.\n\nCostco is the second major retailer to recall Foster Farms chicken. Kroger Co. pulled chicken from the three Foster Farms processing plants off its shelves last week. Even with the severity of the outbreak, the USDA and Foster Farms did not issue a recall of all of the chicken in question because they consider Salmonella to be a naturally occurring bacterium that can be killed by cooking the food thoroughly.\n\nThe USDA nearly closed the three Foster Farms facilities \u2014 two in Fresno and one in Livingston, Calif. \u2014 last week, but chose not to after the chicken company revealed plans to clean up areas where contamination was likely.\n\nSalmonella Heidelberg, however, has already caused double the hospitalizations than expected for an outbreak of its size. The particular strain has been found to be resistant to multiple types of antibiotics. As of Oct. 11, 42 percent of those sickened were hospitalized, and 13 percent of them had Salmonella septicemia, a life-threatening full-body inflammation caused by infection of the blood.\n\nTo prevent illness from Salmonella and any kind of cross-contamination, here are six tips for buying, washing, and cooking chicken safely.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "salmonella, chicken, foster, farms, heidelberg, costco, fsis", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "As the Salmonella outbreak continues to spread, one Costco store has recalled up to 40,000 lbs. in rotisserie chicken after one person fell sick from eating it.", "title": "Salmonella Outbreak Spreads To 317 People, 20 States", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/salmonella-outbreak-2013-update-disease-spreads-317-people-20-states-costco-recalls-40000-lbs-259965", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/15/chicken_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As the Salmonella outbreak continues to spread, one Costco store has recalled up to 40,000 lbs. in rotisserie chicken after one person fell sick from eating it.", "title": "Salmonella Outbreak Spreads To 317 People, 20 States", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/salmonella-outbreak-2013-update-disease-spreads-317-people-20-states-costco-recalls-40000-lbs-259965", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/15/chicken_0.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/15/chicken_0.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2013-10-15T16:27:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-15T16:33:36-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "As the Salmonella outbreak continues to spread, one Costco store has recalled up to 40,000 lbs. in rotisserie chicken after one person fell sick from eating it."}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s still unclear how the Costco chicken caused illness in one victim because all Costco chicken is cooked to at least 180\u00b0F, Craig Wilson, the wholesale store\u2019s vice president for food safety, told the Los Angeles Times.\nAs the Salmonella outbreak continues to spread, one Costco store has recalled up to 40,000 lbs.\nin rotisserie chicken after one person fell sick from eating it.\nCostco is the second major retailer to recall Foster Farms chicken.\nKroger Co. pulled chicken from the three Foster Farms processing plants off its shelves last week."}
