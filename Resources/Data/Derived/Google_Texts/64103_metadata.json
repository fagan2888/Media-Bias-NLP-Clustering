Burwell case, Republicans at least pretend to believe that the Affordable Care Act was written in such a way as to deny subsidies \u2013 on purpose \u2013 to consumers who enrolled through healthcare.gov.\n\nTo that end, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) thought he was making an important point yesterday, addressing the Constitutional Accountability Center\u2019s Elizabeth Wydra:\n\n\u201cI think maybe, Ms. Wydra, the statute could have just been written, \u2018Our goal is to make available health care for all Americans.\u2019 That wasn\u2019t what the law said, however.\u201d\n\nSoon after, Wydra had a chance to respond.\n\n\u201cSen. Sessions joked that the statute should have been written to say to health care \u2018should be available for all Americans.\u2019 Well, point of fact, Title I of the act is titled, \u2018Qualify, affordable health care for all Americans.\u2019 \u201cSo that is the stated purpose of the law and it wouldn\u2019t make any sense for Congress to have written the tax-credit eligibility to defeat that purpose.\u201d\n\nWell, look at that. We just saw the entire King v. Burwell controversy get resolved in 41 seconds . Someone let the justices know their input is no longer required. The whole thing was caught on video\n\nThe New Republic\u2019s Brian Beutler described the exchange as a \u201csuccinct, pithy demolition\u201d of the \u201cbad faith\u201d arguments behind the King v Burwell case.\n\nI couldn\u2019t agree more. As literally everyone involved in the process already knows, the purpose of the law was unambiguous: consumers would be eligible for insurance subsidies based on income levels. Republican opponents of the law are now pretending they don\u2019t understand that, going through the motions as if the law secretly intended to deny subsidies \u2013 on purpose \u2013 to every consumer who gained coverage through the federal exchange.\n\nAs Sessions put it yesterday, if the law\u2019s authors \u2013 who are still walking around, telling anyone who\u2019ll listen exactly what the law was designed to do \u2013 wanted to make affordable care available to everyone, they should have put that language in the Obamacare statute itself.\n\nBut that\u2019s what makes Wydra\u2019s response so brutal: the ACA\u2019s authors did put that language in the Obamacare statute itself .\n\nJust once, I want to hear an ACA critic admit what is plainly true: King v. Burwell is a brazenly stupid con, but they\u2019re playing along with the charade because they really hate the president and his signature domestic policy initiative.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "We just saw the entire King v.
