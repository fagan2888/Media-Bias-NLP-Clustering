In his \u201cconservative\u201d ignorance he uses abortion as an issue when rampant authoritarianism and government involvement in personal decision is what people are actually pissed off about.\n\nMany in the right don\u2019t understand this and that does nothing but exacerbate the anger.\n\nTo save space this is just my response.\n\nYou may want to read Cheney\u2019s original post so this all makes sense.\n\nPro-life and pro-choice is a religious issue\n\nTrue, no it\u2019s not.\n\nIt\u2019s a freedom issue and it\u2019s clear most so-called freedom loving conservatives love neither freedom, nor conservation of the founding. They wish to use government to enforce their morality, just as the Marxists.\n\nDarrell Cheney may believe in the sanctity of life, but not liberty. Protecting a life that is not inside of you has nothing to do with you, or especially government.\n\nIt\u2019s between God and parent.\n\nReligious socialism is still socialism, and that\u2019s really what he\u2019s preaching \u2014 he doesn\u2019t actually believe this is a non-religious issue.\n\nThe two sides are pro-life and pro-choice\n\nBoth of his points are invalid. They do not offer you a free choice on either side.\n\nThe Leftists want abortion to lower population and the right-wingers wants to force their will on your personal realm.\n\nAdding to my prior point, this argument is constantly surrounding the involvement of government. It is not in their authority, as per Jefferson\u2019s \u201cThe World Belongs to the Living\u201d.\n\nGovernment has no say what-so-ever in that which is not here breathing. Either opinion \u2014 pro-life or pro-choice \u2014 is a matter of social debate and personal activity. Violation of this is by definition tyranny.\n\nMen shouldn\u2019t exact their will upon women\n\n\u201cThe laws we pass as a country and the laws on the books are exactly that \u2013 a system of beliefs that are, in essence, pushed on everyone.\u201d\n\nThis person is a tyrant and thus their opinion is null and void.\n\nThe goal in the advancement of the Republic is to whittle government at every level out of the personal decisions of each individual and only to be able to arbitrate punishments after the fact.\n\nHis ignorance is compounded and proven in stating illegal law (such as Obamacare, which everyone ounce of Jefferson and Madisonian ideology tells us not to obey) is an appeal to keep false authority in your mindset so when those he agrees with get in charge and pass infringing laws you are convinced to obey them.\n\nSelf-government is not sending representatives, it is living as you see fit, taking responsibility for the effects from those choices by no one else. Unless those you interact with incur damage, theft, or trespass. Even then they have a right to immediately respond against you.\n\n\u201cDo no harm\u201d, is what Locke said not, \u201cStop harm from being possible.\u201d\n\nSmall minds like this believe you have the right as a community from keeping bad things from even possibly happening.\n\nNot only does this attempt to violate nature and liberty, but it is again\u2026 tyranny.\n\nThe baby isn\u2019t a human life until a certain point, it\u2019s just a mass of cells\n\nNone of government\u2019s business. If you believe murder is happening\u2026 use your gun.\n\nIt\u2019s not a human unless it\u2019s viable outside of the womb\n\nNone of government\u2019s business. If you believe murder is happening\u2026 use your gun.\n\nIt\u2019s a woman\u2019s choice and right to decide what she does with her body\n\nNone of government\u2019s business. If you believe murder is happening\u2026 use your gun.\n\nThis is a false issue.\n\nThere are communists in the government making law. That\u2019s the issue.\n\nAbortion is being used for Christian Socialism to creep in and propel the lie this is a \u201cChristian Nation\u201d.\n\nIt is actually a Nation of the Free.\n\nThis issue isn\u2019t one of authority to mind themselves with, and is only a matter for those involved. If you think its murder, shoot those committing it and let your community decide through jurisprudence if you did the right thing, or not, on a case-by-case basis.\n\nUse of force to defend is a right of nature, laws specializing authority illegally is how we have socialists thinking they could use public money for any of this in the first place.\n\nIf legislators had obeyed the founders and not funded churches within the states, there would have been no argument for others to fund their socialist programs in the first place.\n\nYou who keep building your own demise and threatening those of us who are truly free will be held responsible for it.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Hammer of Truth", "description": "I thought I\u2019d share my response to a piece by Darrell Cheney on The Blaze.
