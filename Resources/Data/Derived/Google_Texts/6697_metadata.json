(AP) - After 45 years of leading the Green Valley Clinic in Bergton, 81-year-old Dr. Linford Gehman is closing the center\u2019s doors for good - but he\u2019s not retiring.\n\nThe country doctor plans on practicing for another two years, this time from the halls of E.A. Hawse Health Center in Mathias, W.Va., a mere eight miles up the road from Green Valley Clinic on Brocks Gap Road.\n\nGehman knew years ago while trying to recruit another full-time physician at Green Valley, that his successor would be required to make various upgrades to the rural clinic over time, especially the transition to electronic medical records. Those changes \u201cwouldn\u2019t be cost-effective to keep (the clinic) open in a low population area,\u201d Gehman said.\n\nGehman said it would be in the best interest of the patients to close the clinic and continue practicing from the Hawse center, which he said has a \u201cfederally funded, state-of-the-art program.\u201d\n\nThe center, he said, will be convenient for his many patients who had been crossing state lines to be seen at Green Valley, as well as those who live in Fulks Run, Criders and other rural northern Rockingham communities.\n\nGreen Valley\u2019s three employees - medical assistant Patty Miller, registered nurse Elaine See-Dellinger and licensed practical nurse Debbie Whetzel - will be joining Gehman at the Mathias clinic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re like family here,\u201d See-Dellinger said in a phone interview, adding that she\u2019s \u201cnever heard an unkind word\u201d from Gehman.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a really supportive, compassionate person - there aren\u2019t enough words to describe him,\u201d she said.\n\nGraduating from Eastern Mennonite College, now Eastern Mennonite University, Gehman continued his education at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, from which he graduated in 1963 at age 30. He went on to complete his internship and residency at St. Luke\u2019s Hospital in Pennsylvania.\n\nHis move to Bergton came after volunteering with the Mennonite Central Committee for nearly five years, first at a hospital in Nha Trang, South Vietnam, for more than three years during the Vietnam War, followed by another year in Biafra, Nigeria, during that country\u2019s civil war in the 1960s.\n\nIn 1970, Gehman married his wife, Becky, who also has worked at Green Valley over the years as a nurse, and the pair made the \u201cvery peaceful move\u201d to the Shenandoah Valley, relative to his previous assignments.\n\nWith his home just steps away from Green Valley, Gehman said the center\u2019s office phone is also connected to his house, so patients can still reach him after office hours.\n\n\u201cThe community has been very kind to us through the years,\u201d he said.\n\nSince Green Valley opened in 1949, it\u2019s \u201cbeen a place where people since then have expected to only have to go there,\u201d he said That makes Gehman sorry, he said, for having to close its doors to more than 1,000 patients.\n\nWhile acknowledging few doctors still practice medicine at his age, he maintains that he\u2019s in reasonably good health, but knows \u201cwhen to fold.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to stay on (if) I\u2019m not mentally proficient and capable of continuing to take responsibility for people\u2019s health,\u201d he said.\n\nAs the staff prepared to close Green Valley\u2019s doors for good on Friday, Gehman said they are continuing to schedule patients without interruptions.\n\nStarting Monday, he will resume seeing patients from the E.A. Hawse Center in Mathias.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve really appreciated the support of .a community of very gracious patients through the years,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Daily News-Record, http://www.dnronline.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "After 45 years of leading the Green Valley Clinic in Bergton, 81-year-old Dr. Linford Gehman is closing the center's doors for good - but he's not retiring.", "Author": "ELAINA SAUBER", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "After 45 years of leading the Green Valley Clinic in Bergton, 81-year-old Dr. Linford Gehman is closing the center\u2019s doors for good - but he\u2019s not retiring.", "title": "81-year-old Va. doctor closing clinic, plans to relocate", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/17/81-year-old-va-doctor-closing-clinic-plans-to-relo/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/17/ea225c4297396a026b0f6a7067006129.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/17/ea225c4297396a026b0f6a7067006129.jpg", "title": "81-year-old Va. doctor closing clinic, plans to relocate", "description": "After 45 years of leading the Green Valley Clinic in Bergton, 81-year-old Dr. Linford Gehman is closing the center's doors for good - but he's not retiring.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "BERGTON, Va.
