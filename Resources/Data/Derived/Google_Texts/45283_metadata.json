This will, in turn, provide increased impetus for healthcare companies to invest in \u201cmajor digital healthcare players\u201d, for example Epocrates and AirStrip.\n\nAdvanced electronic health records [EHRs], which have been heavily debated in the UK, will become the \u201cglue\u201d to create a wider digital health ecosystem just so long as the regulations are relaxed to let them become more prevalent.\n\nThis in mind, the report did warn that widespread trials are still needed in order to convince the healthcare sector to fully embrace remote patient monitoring solutions due to worries over patient data and the reliability of systems.\n\nThe issue is one that has been in the news in the UK over the past 12 months after the NHS produced their own risk analysis that admitted creating the \u00a350 million Care.data medical records database has the potential to allow hackers to target patients.\n\nRead more: Can big data keep NHS healthcare free to all?\n\nCare.data will hold information on past illnesses, medication, weight and blood pressure taken from medical records and all households in the UK have the chance to opt out of the scheme before it launches.\n\nImage Credit: Flickr (iBoom Media)Porthole Ad", "article_metadata": {"description": "A report into the sector found that Apple\u2019s HealthKit and Samsung\u2019s Sami will both increase uptake of healthcare accessories and that ObamaCare has the potential to help relax regulations.", "og": {"site_name": "ITProPortal", "description": "A report into the sector found that Apple\u2019s HealthKit and Samsung\u2019s Sami will both increase uptake of healthcare accessories and that ObamaCare has the potential to help relax regulations.", "title": "Juniper: Apple and Samsung can trigger $3b healthcare revolution", "url": "http://www.itproportal.com/2014/10/09/juniper-apple-and-samsung-can-trigger-3b-healthcare-revolution/", "image": "http://files.itproportal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/15090991557_12d2e599ba_b_contentfullwidth.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-09T14:47:13+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A report into the sector found that Apple\u2019s HealthKit and Samsung\u2019s Sami will both increase uptake of healthcare accessories and that ObamaCare has the potential to help relax regulations.", "title": "Juniper: Apple and Samsung can trigger $3b healthcare revolution | ITProPortal.com", "url": "http://www.itproportal.com/2014/10/09/juniper-apple-and-samsung-can-trigger-3b-healthcare-revolution/", "image": "http://files.itproportal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/15090991557_12d2e599ba_b_contentfullwidth-150x150.jpg", "site": "@itproportal", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 669079802, "app_id": 532706646742220}, "keywords": "apple-2,care-data,electronic-health-record,healthcare,healthkit,juniper-research,sami,samsung-2", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/ITProPortal", "section": "Business", "tag": "apple,care.data,electronic health record,healthcare,healthkit,juniper research,sami,samsung", "published_time": "2014-10-09T15:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-09T14:47:13+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb76b\"", "article_summary": "This will, in turn, provide increased impetus for healthcare companies to invest in \u201cmajor digital healthcare players\u201d, for example Epocrates and AirStrip.\nIt\u2019s thought ObamaCare will force regulatory authorities to accept the role that digital health has to play and relax restrictions on digital health companies to help bring about wider usage in the healthcare sector.\nApple and Samsung healthcare APIs have the potential to drive the global healthcare accessory sector onto a new level of revenue that the current crop of companies can only dream of realising.\n\u201cAs health platforms support more \u2018medical\u2019 devices, rather than just today\u2019s fitness trackers, they will usurp the territory occupied by chronic disease monitoring companies,\u201d stated Cox.\nCare.data will hold information on past illnesses, medication, weight and blood pressure taken from medical records and all households in the UK have the chance to opt out of the scheme before it launches."}
