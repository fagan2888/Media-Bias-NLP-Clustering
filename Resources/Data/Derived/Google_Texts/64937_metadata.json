Scrambling for political cover in the wake of the gun rampage and news that alleged shooter Robert Dear likely targeted Planned Parenthood for political purposes, conservative commentators quickly rewrote their long-held talking points about inciting violence.\n\nHere\u2019s the spin that the conservative press, along with the Republican Party, is now desperately trying to push: When you call people \u201cbaby killers\u201d and \u201cmurderers\u201d and claim organizations sell \u201cbaby parts\u201d for profit, you\u2019re in no way promoting violence. And you\u2019re in no way responsible if a like-minded person takes matters into his own hands, opens fire on a Planned Parenthood facility, shoots eleven people, murders three, and then reportedly makes reference to \u201cno more baby parts\u201d when the carnage is over.\n\nThere is no connection between acts of political violence and extremist rhetoric. It\u2019s simply \u201cunfair.\u201d Or so goes the Fox News mantra this week.\n\nWhy the whiplash injuries? Because for the last year Fox and its allies have been warning that rhetoric kills. And specifically, rhetoric from Black Lives Matter activists gets police officers killed. (There\u2019s no evidence to support that claim.) And for that, Democrats, including President Obama, are to blame for the so-called \u201cwar on cops.\u201d\n\nSo in a matter of just a few days (i.e. pre-Colorado Springs vs. post-Colorado Springs), Fox News has thrown away its established playbook and quickly written a new one where everyone should just chill about incendiary political taunts that are seen as being violent and potentially deadly. (Going one step further: \u201cSo what\u201d if far-right rhetoric inspires killings?)\n\nAmidst the Fox News flip-flop, which brand of activist rhetoric is actually producing bouts of targeted violence today? As 2015 unfolds against the backdrop of Black Lives Matter protests, note that the number of officers shot and killed in the line of the duty has gone down this year.\n\nBy contrast, Planned Parenthood has experienced a spike in attacks on its facilities and employees this year, most likely the result of a coordinated smear campaign against the organization in the form of duplicitous videos, which kicked off last summer and have been heavily promoted by Fox News and other conservative media.\n\nIn fact, rather than producing violence as Fox suggests, Black Lives Matter protesters last week in Minneapolis were the target of gun violence. Four men have been charged in the shooting of five black protesters. Three of the arrested were reportedly fascinated \u201cwith guns, video games, the Confederacy and right-wing militia groups.\u201d\n\nThe truth is Fox News has denounced Black Lives Matter as a \u201c\u2018murder\u2019 movement\u201d and compared it to the Ku Klux Klan. It has also blamed the group for inciting violence.\n\nIn May, after NYPD officer Brian Moore was killed, Fox host Eric Bolling responded by suggesting liberals and their \u201cwar on cops\u201d was at fault. According to Bolling, \u201cThe \u2018anti-cop left\u2019 in America seems to be \u2026 fueling some of this hatred and, you know, murderous streak that\u2019s going on against cops.\u201d\n\nAs mentioned, there is no \u201cmurderous streak\u201d against cops in this country. And as Vox recently noted, \u201cThe goals and message of Black Lives Matter have nothing to do with harming police officers in any way. The movement is explicitly concerned with reducing the racial disparities found in the criminal justice system.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "O'Reilly & Co. can rail against Black Lives Matter all they want, but they're the ones actually inciting attacks", "title": "Fox News is lying to itself: Its violent rhetoric really is putting lives at risk", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "O'Reilly & Co. can rail against Black Lives Matter all they want, but they're the ones actually inciting attacks", "title": "Fox News is lying to itself: Its violent rhetoric really is putting lives at risk", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/03/fox_news_cant_bear_the_truth_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/oreilly-biden.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "O'Reilly & Co. can rail against Black Lives Matter all they want, but they're the ones actually inciting attacks", "title": "Fox News is lying to itself: Its violent rhetoric really is putting lives at risk", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/oreilly-biden.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Eric Boehlert", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, black lives matter, Fox News, Media Matters", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "And as Vox recently noted, \u201cThe goals and message of Black Lives Matter have nothing to do with harming police officers in any way.\nAnd specifically, rhetoric from Black Lives Matter activists gets police officers killed.\nIn fact, rather than producing violence as Fox suggests, Black Lives Matter protesters last week in Minneapolis were the target of gun violence.\nAs 2015 unfolds against the backdrop of Black Lives Matter protests, note that the number of officers shot and killed in the line of the duty has gone down this year.\nThere is no connection between acts of political violence and extremist rhetoric."}
