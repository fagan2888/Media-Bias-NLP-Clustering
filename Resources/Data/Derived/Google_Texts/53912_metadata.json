Now an increasing number are being turned back before they even reach the Rio Grande \u2014 by Mexican police.\n\nMexico deported 25,069 Central Americans in January and February this year, almost double the number in the same period last year, new Mexican government data show. Of these deportees, 3,289 were minors.\n\nThe issue of Central American migrants grabbed attention in the US last summer, when agents detained record numbers of minors entering the country illegally alone. By the end of the fiscal year, they had detained 67,339 unaccompanied children, four times the 2011 level, according to US Customs and Border Protection.\n\nThe highest number came from Honduras, with 18,244 children \u2014 a rise of 18 times in three years. Guatemala and El Salvador followed.\n\nMany Central American children flee murderous gangs. Others run from poverty or look to reunite with their parents working in the United States.\n\nThe increase in children led to what President Barack Obama called \u201can urgent humanitarian situation\u201d on the southern border, provoking emergency meetings with Mexican and Central American leaders.\n\nSince those, Mexico has stepped up its deportations, stopping many migrants from reaching the US border and from causing a repeat of last summer\u2019s crisis.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's not just U.S. border patrol nabbing Central American migrants in record numbers.
