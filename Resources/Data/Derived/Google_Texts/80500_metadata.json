President Obama announced today that he planned to go on offense and continue working to expand the reach of Obamacare to cover more Americans.\n\nVideo:\n\nThe President said:\n\nFive years ago, we finally declared that in America, health care is not a privilege for a few, but a right for all. And this week, after more than fifty votes in Congress to repeal or weaken this law; after a Presidential election based in part on preserving or repealing this law; after multiple challenges to this law before the Supreme Court, we can now say this for certain: the Affordable Care Act still stands, it is working, and it is here to stay.\n\nOn Thursday, when the Court upheld a critical part of the Affordable Care Act, it was a victory for hardworking Americans all across this country whose lives are more secure because of this law. This law means that if you\u2019re a parent, you can keep your kids on your plan until they turn 26. If you\u2019re a senior, or an American with a disability, this law gives you discounts on your prescriptions. You can\u2019t be charged more just because you\u2019re a woman. And you can\u2019t be discriminated against just for having a pre-existing condition.\n\nThis law is working exactly as it\u2019s supposed to \u2013 and in some ways, better than we expected it to. So far more than 16 million uninsured Americans have gained coverage. Nearly one in three Americans who was uninsured a few years ago is insured today. The uninsured rate in America is the lowest since we began to keep such records.\n\nThe law has helped hold the price of health care to its slowest growth in 50 years. If your family gets insurance through the workplace, not through the Affordable Care Act, you\u2019re paying about $1,800 less per year on average than you would be if trends before this law had continued \u2013 which is good for workers and it\u2019s good for the economy.\n\nThe point is, this is not some abstract political debate. For all the misinformation campaigns, and doomsday predictions; for all the talk of death panels and job destruction; for all the repeal attempts \u2013 this law is helping tens of millions of Americans. This isn\u2019t just about Obamacare. This is health care in America.\n\nWith this case behind us, we\u2019re going to keep working to make health care in America even better and more affordable, and to get more people covered. But it is time to stop refighting battles that have been settled again and again. It\u2019s time to move on.\n\nBecause as Americans, we don\u2019t go backwards, we move forwards. We take care of each other. We root for one another\u2019s success. We strive to do better, to be better, than the generation before us, and we try to build something better for the generation coming behind us. With this behind us, let\u2019s come together and keep building something better right now.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama isn\u2019t going to sit back and enjoy his administration\u2019s victory. Obama is looking to expand the reach of the law by getting more people covered. The President can do this by aggressively promoting the law. He doesn\u2019t need Congress, or a new piece of legislation.\n\nThe administration has been quietly at work trying to persuade those states that haven\u2019t expanded Medicaid to do so. The President can use the platform of the presidency to aggressively promote the law.\n\nThe political battlefield has shifted from President Obama and Democrats defending the law to Republicans being knocked back on their heels as healthcare in the United States is changing forever.\n\nPresident Obama is moving forward, and the Republican Party\u2019s bad week just got a whole lot worse.", "article_metadata": {"description": "More bad news for Republicans.
