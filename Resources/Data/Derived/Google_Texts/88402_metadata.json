We are a small business and it\u2019s very much like a family, so I care about our staff,\u201d Vittorio told WCNC.\n\nShe previously offered her employees health insurance and paid part of it, but has been forced to reconsider her decision because of the rising costs of premiums.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been very proud to even carry it for this long, but it\u2019s certainly a concern moving into the future if we\u2019re going to be able to keep doing it,\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating and scary and you don\u2019t know what to expect,\u201d said Veronica Cook, a hairdresser who has worked at Fresh Salon since it opened. She is not sure what she will do if she has to pay more for insurance.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know [how I will do it]. I don\u2019t really know what I would do, in all honesty,\u201d Cook agonized.\n\nVittorio has yet to receive any answers from her health insurance carrier. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough conversation to have. It\u2019s a tough decision to make and think about it. You\u2019re not just basing the decision on finances when there are people and their families involved,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "A North Carolina woman currently living her dream- to own a salon- could soon shatter and crumble, leaving her employees to pay astronomical costs for health insurance, all because of Obamacare.
