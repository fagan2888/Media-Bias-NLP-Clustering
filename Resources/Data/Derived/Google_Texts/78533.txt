As part of an ongoing series of reports on income inequality, Project 21 member Hughey Newsome provided expert commentary on the January 24 edition of “Special Report with Bret Baier” on the Fox News Channel. Hughey talked about remedies to income inequality that don’t require the government to redistribute American wealth.

This segment dealt with the “social fabric” of the income inequality debate, with Fox News correspondent Jim Angle pointing out that “there is one key principle in the debate over income inequality – it’s not about equality of income.”

Hughey and others featured in the report discussed how equality of opportunity is the key to earning and advancement potential, and how strong families and education are paths to success.

At one point, Hughey echoes President Ronald Reagan by saying:

Giving someone a job is the best assistance that you can give them to get out of poverty as opposed to a government handout. It’s so true.

Reagan once famously quipped: “I believe the best social program is a job.”
