Instead, financing awarded before June 30 would continue through the life of the loans, loan guarantees and insurance policies.\n\nThe bank, however, wouldn\u2019t be able to extend new financing.\n\n\u201cNone of us actually expire June 30,\u201d Fred Hochberg, Ex-Im\u2019s chairman, told Politico. \u201cThe bank\u2019s authority to make a new loan expires on June 30, if Congress doesn\u2019t act before that.\u201d\n\nEx-Im\u2019s existing financing currently totals more than $140 billion. Though the bank hasn\u2019t published its most recent authorizations\u2014with public data available only before Sept. 30, 2014\u2014direct loans are extended for 12 years. For renewable energy projects, loans are awarded for 18 years.\n\nA report published today by Diane Katz of The Heritage Foundation and Veronique de Rugy of the Mercatus Center at George Mason University outlined what would happen should if Ex-Im charter expires.\n\n\u201cThe Export-Import Bank of the United States shall continue to exercise its functions in connection with and in furtherance of its objects and purposes until the close of business \u2026 but the provisions of this section shall not be construed as preventing the bank from acquiring obligations prior to such date which mature subsequent to such date or from assuming prior to such date liability as guarantor, endorser, or acceptor of obligations which mature subsequent to such date or from issuing, either prior or subsequent to such date,\u201d Ex-Im\u2019s charter states.\n\n>>> Republicans Face \u2018Principled Debate\u2019 Over Export-Import Bank\u2019s Future\n\nThe bank, de Rugy and Katz noted, is obligated to continue operating without a charter \u201cfor purposes of orderly liquidation, including the administration of its asset and the collection of any obligations held by the bank.\u201d However, it\u2019s not clear what \u201corderly liquidation\u201d includes.\n\n\u201cObviously, then, Congress anticipated that the bank would honor its commitments after the charter expired,\u201d de Rugy and Katz said.\n\nThough Ex-Im beneficiaries like Boeing and General Electric have stressed that the bank\u2019s expiration would hurt their business, the companies have their own financing arms.\n\nAdditionally, Tim Neale, a spokesman for Boeing, said the company would help to secure financing for its customers.\n\n\u201cWe do provide some customer financing, and if there\u2019s a short-term shutdown of Ex-Im, we will work with customers who are scheduled for deliveries to ensure they get the financing they need, even if we have to provide it ourselves,\u201d he told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nNeale noted that the company would rather use their financing for its own operations, but said their offer provided Boeing customers with reassurance.\n\n\u201cThe uncertainty is a risk for them and therefore could become a factor in who wins some of the campaigns currently under way,\u201d Neale continued.\n\nIn separate statements, the chairmen of the two committees with jurisdiction over the embattled agency\u2014House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling and Senate Banking Chairman Richard Shelby\u2014 have said they won\u2019t bring bills reauthorizing the bank before their respective panels.\n\nAdditionally, the House is waiting for the Senate to pass a reauthorization bill. The upper chamber, meanwhile, has little room in its schedule to do so, meaning Ex-Im\u2019s charter could expire for the first time since it was established more than 80 years ago.\n\nA vote held yesterday on reauthorization, though, indicated that the majority of senators\u201465\u2014support Ex-Im reauthorization.\n\nStill, there has been a shift in support for the bank.\n\nIn 2012, just 19 GOP senators supported ending the bank, while 78 senators total called for its reauthorization. During yesterday\u2019s vote, the number of Republican senators voting against reauthorization rose to 30, with 65 total supporting extending the bank\u2019s life.\n\n>>> How This Small Business Succeeded Without Government Financing From Export-Import Bank", "article_metadata": {"description": "As its expiration date nears, Ex-Im Bank\u2019s biggest beneficiaries and supporters are warning that Ex-Im\u2019s end could be bad for business.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "As its expiration date nears, Ex-Im Bank\u2019s biggest beneficiaries and supporters are warning that Ex-Im\u2019s end could be bad for business.", "title": "What Happens if the Export-Import Bank\u2019s Charter Expires?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150610_LifeAfterDeath_Quinn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-10T22:43:47+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1MpBoak"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "As its expiration date nears, Ex-Im Bank\u2019s biggest beneficiaries and supporters are warning that Ex-Im\u2019s end could be bad for business.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150610_LifeAfterDeath_Quinn.jpg"}, "title": "What Happens if the Export-Import Bank\u2019s Charter Expires?", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "cronyism", "published_time": "2015-06-11T03:01:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-10T22:43:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Export-Import Bank, Heritage Action for America, Boeing, General Electric, Fred Hochberg, Diane Katz, Veronique de Rugy, Jeb Hensarling, Richard Shelby"}, "article_summary": "As its expiration date nears, the Export-Import Bank\u2019s biggest beneficiaries and supporters are warning that Ex-Im\u2019s end could be bad for business.\nExpiration of Ex-Im\u2019s charter hardly means that current deals would cease to exist.\n>>> How This Small Business Succeeded Without Government Financing From Export-Import Bank\nThe upper chamber, meanwhile, has little room in its schedule to do so, meaning Ex-Im\u2019s charter could expire for the first time since it was established more than 80 years ago.\nDuring yesterday\u2019s vote, the number of Republican senators voting against reauthorization rose to 30, with 65 total supporting extending the bank\u2019s life."}
