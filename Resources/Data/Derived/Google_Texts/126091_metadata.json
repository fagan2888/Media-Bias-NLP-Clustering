Mr. Do Bee focuses on the real attacker and shoots him in the face.\n\nMr. Don\u2019t Bee makes up stories about nukes in Iraq that don\u2019t exist.\n\nMr. Do Bee makes a treaty with Iran, so that they don\u2019t build nukes at all.\n\nMr. Don\u2019t Bee tortures prisoners.\n\nMr. Do Bee says that sounds bad.\n\nMr. Don\u2019t Bee gets his actionable intel from Jesus.\n\nMr. Do Bee gets his from tapping your phone.\n\nMr. Do Bee\u2019s best foreign policy move brings our casualty rate down by about sixty-percent.\n\nMr. Don\u2019t Bee\u2019s best foreign policy move was dodging a shoe.\n\n\u2026.\n\nWe\u2019ve learned nothing.
