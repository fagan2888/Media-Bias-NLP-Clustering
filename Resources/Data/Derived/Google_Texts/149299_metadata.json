Here is a glimpse into the world of Utah politics and policy over the next five weeks:\n\nTaxes \u2013 The Utah Legislature is considering three major tax proposals: two tax hikes and one tax cut. The tax hikes include proposals to increase income taxes by 20 percent to fund public schools, and to raise revenue for transportation, either by turning the per-gallon gas tax into a sales tax based on price per-gallon or simply raise the current per-gallon gas tax by 20-40 percent. The tax cut proposal is to reduce corporate income taxes by 50 percent for the sake of job creation and economic growth, generating additional tax revenue in the process to help pay for this proposed tax cut.\n\nBeyond simply opposing harmful tax increases, policymakers should seek to ensure that any proposal to increase generally applicable taxes also includes fundamental and beneficial reforms of the government programs and services they seek to raise funding for. While tax hikes in general are a bad idea, tax hikes that only reform programs at the margins, or do not include any reforms at all, should not be seriously considered.\n\nMedicaid Expansion \u2013 The Legislature is considering Governor Gary Herbert\u2019s preferred version of full-Medicaid expansion (covering 100,000+ Utahns) under Obamacare \u2013 dubbed Healthy Utah \u2013 along with a recommendation from the Legislature\u2019s Health Reform Task Force to only expand Medicaid to those deemed \u201cmedically frail\u201d (about 10,000-20,000 individuals with critical, immediate health needs). Another option on the table is to simply maintain Utah\u2019s current Medicaid system while we see how things play out in other states that have expanded but are now reconsidering their decision.\n\nUtah policymakers should carefully consider the likely impacts of full Medicaid expansion on Utah\u2019s most vulnerable population: the disabled individuals and low-income single-parents and children currently on Medicaid, for whom the program was designed. Adding 60,000-70,000 currently uninsured individuals to the ranks of the privately insured will send the signal to the health care market that the health care needs of these newly insured individuals should be prioritized over the needs of those currently in Medicaid, due to the higher payment rates offered by typical private insurance coverage. If we want to improve the health care access of the currently uninsured (a laudable goal to be sure) the most unjustifiable and indefensible way to do it is at the expense of the health care access of the most vulnerable people in Utah.\n\nCriminal Justice Reform \u2013 In addition to considering a move of the aging state prison, which currently sits on valuable land in one of Utah\u2019s fastest-growing business corridors, there are proposals to reform how the criminal justice system interacts with and treats current and ex-felons. As enacted in other states, such as Texas and Georgia, these proposals are savings taxpayers millions and reducing the pressure on crowded prison systems.\n\nIn this arena, policymakers should take the long view: looking to invest now in programs that will generate significant savings over the next decade or so. Conservative reforms to the criminal justice system are proving to be effective at improving public safety outcomes and saving taxpayer dollars. What\u2019s more, these reforms treat ex-felons as the real human beings they are: giving them a genuine chance to reform their lives and become productive members of their community, while continuing to protect innocent individuals from truly dangerous individuals that continue lives of crime even when given other opportunities.\n\nState School Board Election Reform \u2013 Last, but not least, a federal judge ruled that Utah\u2019s complicated system of school board elections (candidates recruited and vetted by a committee, followed by the governor choosing who ends up on the ballot) is unconstitutional. For many years competing school board election proposals have failed, but the judicial ruling is likely to compel action on one or multiple proposals in this area.\n\nLegislators should look for the most conservative proposal that will actually get the votes to pass, likely requiring principled compromise. There is a real opportunity for beneficial reform to the state school board election system, but the history on this issue is not promising, and if anything points to a likely outcome where a few basic tweaks to the current system (which few think is good) are made to bring it in line with the judicial ruling. Rather than accepting what would basically amount to the status quo, conservatives who favor reform of this system should find the next least-objectionable proposal that has significant support behind it, and hammer out a compromise that can finally obtain the votes necessary to improve the current system.\n\nSutherland is glad to engage these important issues during the legislative session. All of them are important, and all provide hopeful opportunities for policy changes that can benefit families, individuals and communities in Utah. We are optimistic that such will be the case in Utah in 2015.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The 2015 Utah Legislative Session is in full swing, and a bevy of significant issues and legislation will be debated and decided.", "title": "What to expect from the 2015 Utah legislative session - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/01/Utah.jpg", "url": "http://watchdog.org/199703/expect-2015-utah-legislative-session/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Opinion", "published_time": "2015-02-12T13:59:18+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The 2015 Utah Legislative Session is in full swing, and a bevy of significant issues and legislation will be debated and decided.", "title": "What to expect from the 2015 Utah legislative session - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/01/Utah.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "The 2015 Utah Legislative Session is in full swing, and a bevy of significant issues and legislation will be debated and decided."}, "article_summary": "Here is a glimpse into the world of Utah politics and policy over the next five weeks:Taxes \u2013 The Utah Legislature is considering three major tax proposals: two tax hikes and one tax cut.\nBy Derek Monson | Watchdog OpinionThe 2015 Utah Legislative Session is in full swing, and, as is the case in every state, a bevy of significant issues and legislation will be debated and decided.\nAnother option on the table is to simply maintain Utah\u2019s current Medicaid system while we see how things play out in other states that have expanded but are now reconsidering their decision.\nAll of them are important, and all provide hopeful opportunities for policy changes that can benefit families, individuals and communities in Utah.\nWe are optimistic that such will be the case in Utah in 2015."}
