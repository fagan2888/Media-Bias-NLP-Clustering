The forgotten story of professionalism\u2019s failure to contain physician greed provides an important policy perspective.\n\nThe Myth Of Medicine\u2019s \u2018Golden Age\u2019\n\nMedical practice pre-1965 is often portrayed as a mythical \u201cGolden Age.\u201d The truth, as I found researching my 1997 book, Demanding Medical Excellence: Doctors and Accountability in the Information Age, was that the post-war years were a time when way too many doctors grasped for the gold.\n\nThe most common \u201centrepreneurial\u201d excesses were fee splitting, where a specialist paid a kickback to the referring doctor, and ghost surgery, where a surgeon secretly paid a colleague to operate on an anesthetized patient. The first surgeon paid the \u201cghost\u201d a small part of the total fee and pocketed the difference. Even worse was rampant surgical overuse, where common excesses included appendectomies for stomachaches and hysterectomies on young women with nothing more than back pain.\n\nAlthough professional societies wielded far more influence than now, efforts by leaders of the AMA and the American College of Surgeons to stop these abuses repeatedly fell short. Doctors \u201cdisplay a consistent preoccupation with their economic insecurity,\u201d a 1955 report by the AMA concluded with discomfiting bluntness.\n\nThey think about money a lot \u2014 about how to increase their incomes, about the cost of running their offices, about what their colleagues in other specialties make, about what plumbers make for house calls and what a liquor dealer\u2019s net is compared to their own.\n\nA 1956 AMA poll found that 43 percent of patients thought their doctor charged too much, an opinion reflected in a 1959 cartoon in The New Yorker. A balding physician is pictured making a house call to an elderly matron. As she glares from her bed, the doctor opens his little black bag and wads of paper currency pop out. \u201cPshaw! I grabbed the wrong bag,\u201d the doctor exclaims.\n\nDespite this public unease, policymakers were unwilling to intrude on professional prerogatives. Economist Kenneth Arrow explained in a landmark 1963 essay that the market for medical care was unique because outsiders could not judge the quantity or quality of services provided. Instead, the \u201cbehavior expected of sellers of medical care is different from that of business men in general.\u2026The ethically understood restrictions on the activities of a physician are much more severe than on those of, say, a barber.\u201d Or plumber.\n\nMedicare Takes Effect\n\nThis was the environment in which Medicare took effect on July 1, 1966. To appease the AMA, physician payment was based on a local calculation of a \u201ccustomary, prevailing and reasonable\u201d fee. However, doctors did not have to accept Medicare\u2019s fee as payment in full (i.e., \u201ctake assignment\u201d) for any individual patient. With professional self-control the only control, the rate of increase in doctors\u2019 fees doubled. (The net income of nonprofit hospitals shot up 76 percent between 1965 and 1969, but that\u2019s part of a different story.) Establishing a perennial policy staple, the very first National Conference on Medical Costs convened in June 1967.\n\nSpeaking at an AMA conference later that year, AMA president Milford O. Rouse noted that physician fees were rising faster than the cost of food and housing, and he urged members to address \u201cefficiency, cost and methods of delivery\u201d of health services in order to preserve freedom from further government intervention. As in years past, that plea did little to ameliorate profit maximization.\n\nIn July 1969 the Senate held hearings on Medicare and Medicaid fraud, with senators denouncing \u201cruthless providers of health services\u201d who routinely charged the government two to four times what was billed commercial insurers. One general practitioner had billed Medicare $58,000 for home visits to 49 patients. Quipped Senate Finance Committee chairman Russell Long (D-La.): \u201cWho says you can\u2019t get a doctor to make a house call anymore?\u201d\n\nLater that month, President Richard Nixon declared the first health care \u201ccrisis.\u201d John G. Veneman, undersecretary of what was then the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, made a prophetic pronouncement whose candor is difficult to imagine today. Veneman declared: \u201cIn the past, decisions on health care delivery were largely professional ones. Now, the decisions will be largely political.\u201d\n\nBipartisan Influences\n\nAnd so they have been. The 1965 law envisioned voluntary oversight by local physicians of colleagues\u2019 care. When doctors showed no appetite for second-guessing peers, the Social Security Amendments of 1972 authorized Medicare to disallow \u201cany costs unnecessary to the efficient [emphasis added] provision of care\u201d and established Professional Standards Review Organizations (PSROs). That pattern of periodic legislative responses to curb abuses of market power by physicians has continued ever since through Republican and Democratic administrations.\n\nTo give two prominent examples, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1989, signed into law by President George H.W. Bush, referred to increasing the \u201ceffectiveness, efficiency and quality of health services\u201d and changed Medicare physician reimbursement from \u201cusual\u201d charges to fees based on the resources needed to provide those services. In that same vein, the Obama administration\u2019s passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 detailed a host of changes to physician and hospital payment under Title III, \u201cImproving the Quality and Efficiency of Health Care.\u201d\n\nBuyers Become Less Timid\n\nBack in the 1930s, the AMA opposed all health insurance on the grounds that \u201cno third party must be permitted to come between the patient and his physician in any medical relation.\u201d That set a pattern that implicitly intertwined the financial and clinical, whether in opposition to Medicare in the mid-1960s or in the mid-1980s, when the AMA\u2019s top executive told The New York Times that Medicare\u2019s use of diagnosis-related groups for hospital payment had doctors \u201cworried that they\u2019re not going to be allowed to practice medicine\u2026based on their own judgment.\u201d Medicare\u2019s new payment policy was said to invade the doctor-patient relationship, and the AMA warned darkly of \u201crationing.\u201d\n\nSimilar charges are regularly hurled at Medicare today. A more accurate characterization is that a program that began as a timid buyer of medical care has become a much smarter shopper. Rather than being \u201csocialized medicine,\u201d Medicare has been consistently molded by Republican and Democratic policymakers alike into a tougher and more demanding purchaser on behalf of the American public. That\u2019s not rationing, but the rational economic behavior capitalism celebrates. Unsurprisingly, physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, and others who\u2019ve lost market control aren\u2019t eager to acknowledge this reality.\n\nA 1993 poll by the AMA, at a time when the Clinton administration reform proposals seemed on the verge of becoming law, found that an all-time high of 70 percent of the public was beginning to lose faith in their doctors. Sixty-nine percent thought doctors were too interested in making money. The forgotten story of Medicare payment policy suggests there were times when the leaders of American medicine might privately have agreed.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nPolicymakers can learn several lessons from this history. To begin with, accountability and paying prudently strengthen the doctor-patient bond rather than weaken it. Unrestricted fee-for-service payment has often undermined public trust. It is telling that a recent cartoon in The New Yorker echoed the exact same suspicion of misaligned incentives reflected in the 1959 cartoon mentioned above (and, for that matter, much earlier by Mark Twain and George Bernard Shaw). A physician looks at a clipboard with test results while speaking to an anxious patient sitting on the exam room table (no more house calls). The doctor says, \u201cOf course, this could also be confirmation bias from me wanting you to get sick.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, every method of physician payment has drawbacks and dangers, and value-based payment is no exception. \u201cBetter, smarter, healthier\u201d is a worthy goal, but any incentive can lead to unanticipated and undesired consequences. Consolidation of commercial insurers combined with new payment strategies by Medicare could also push the pendulum too far in the opposite direction. Whatever the failings of fee-for-service physicians, health insurers, and large hospital systems, including those nominally organized as nonprofits, are hardly immune from abuse of economic power.\n\nConsumers\u2019 costs of care can be pushed up by the consolidation of local providers, raising prices, or by consolidation of insurers, raising premiums, or simply because certain \u201cmust-have\u201d hospitals charge top dollar for their services. Some physicians could also be excluded from coverage by a health system that includes only its employed doctors in a plan or by a health insurer whose take-it-or-leave-it payment scale leaves some doctors out in the cold.\n\nThe more fundamental question is what \u201cfair\u201d physician payment really means in an era very different from when Medicare was signed into law. While physicians complain vociferously about income, a recent survey of median wages based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data found that six of the top 10 jobs were held by health care professionals, with surgeons leading the way.\n\nMeanwhile, an article in the August issue of the AMA Journal of Ethics examining the history of \u201cmoney and medicine\u201d refers to the \u201cethical challenges\u201d posed by \u201coverconsumption\u201d of medical services by patients with good health insurance, \u201caided and abetted by fee-for-service payment policies.\u201d Doctors, in this reframing, simply \u201cdid their very best to accommodate the growing demand.\u201d\n\nFor more realistic guidance to the future, policymakers would do better to consider a recent editorial in the Journal of General Internal Medicine that proposed a new social contract, one that secures appropriate income and autonomy for physicians in return for a professional embrace of genuine accountability. Whether or not this prescription is exactly the right one, the bipartisan history of Medicare payment reform should encourage policymakers to put aside polarizing rhetoric and thoughtfully engage in efforts to provide better care with smarter spending.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2015/09/10/medicare-fair-pay-and-the-ama-the-forgotten-history/", "site_name": "Health Affairs", "image": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blog_Millenson.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Medicare, Fair Pay, And The AMA: The Forgotten History"}, "description": "Medicare, Fair Pay, And The AMA: The Forgotten History | At the intersection of health, health care, and policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "To appease the AMA, physician payment was based on a local calculation of a \u201ccustomary, prevailing and reasonable\u201d fee.\nThe more fundamental question is what \u201cfair\u201d physician payment really means in an era very different from when Medicare was signed into law.\nThe forgotten story of Medicare payment policy suggests there were times when the leaders of American medicine might privately have agreed.\nA more accurate characterization is that a program that began as a timid buyer of medical care has become a much smarter shopper.\nMedicare Takes EffectThis was the environment in which Medicare took effect on July 1, 1966."}
