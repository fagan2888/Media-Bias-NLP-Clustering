(AP) - Noelle Neff has only been in the position of library director at Keene Memorial library for a little more than a week, but she is already in the process of making big things happen at the facility.\n\nNeff, who formerly worked as a librarian in Phoenix, is in the process of bringing a Think Space to the second-floor of the library.\n\nThe Think Space will consist of a graphics and production studio - comprised of 3D printers, MacBook Computers, a sound and production studio and graphic design center, she said.\n\nNeff said libraries across the country are shifting toward more technology-centered practices to help fully engage patrons who walk through its doors.\n\n\u201cTraditionally libraries just did print, but now we want to give people access to technology, and help people build and grow these skills,\u201d Neff said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say sometimes because people get a little upset, but libraries aren\u2019t being used to just collect books anymore. It\u2019s starting to lean even more toward technology and programming now.\n\nThe Fremont Tribune (http://bit.ly/20gK8aq ) reports that currently, grant proposals are being created that would help raise the necessary funds to purchase the necessary equipment.\n\nThe first grant proposal will be complete Feb. 1, Neff said.\n\nPartnering with the library is The Digg Site Productions. The non-profit organization is dedicated to educating the public through documentary films, to providing an accredited documentary film camp to high school and college students and to expanding film opportunities in Nebraska.\n\nThe company, run by Stacy Heatherly, will provide knowledge and training to help the Think Space get up and running.\n\nNeff said she plans to reach out to the school district to encourage people to participate in this new venture. It will be an educational experience for all parties involved, she said.\n\n\u201cI view the library as an educational center,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to teach people production - teach them how to do all of it. There are so many different things that this will help people of all ages learn . I want to be part of the educational system.\u201d\n\nNeff believes that the library is the perfect place for a Think Take to be located.\n\n\u201cThey can come in here and learn, and even work on projects of their own. It\u2019s like a big think tank,\u201d Neff said. \u201cWe want to bring out creativity. It\u2019s not like anything is graded, we just want to provide all of these different things, and just set them free to learn. That\u2019s the great thing about the library, we aren\u2019t going to charge you to come through the door, we just want you to come in and use it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a consultant,\u201d Neff said. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful support, it\u2019s almost like a miracle to have them helping us out. This is a very small town, and to get this type of support is wonderful.\u201d\n\n___\n\nStory Continues \u2192", "article_metadata": {"description": "Noelle Neff has only been in the position of library director at Keene Memorial library for a little more than a week, but she is already in the process of making big things happen at the facility.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Noelle Neff has only been in the position of library director at Keene Memorial library for a little more than a week, but she is already in the process of making big things happen at the facility.", "title": "Library working to open Think Space in building", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/24/library-working-to-open-think-space-in-building/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/24/exchange_think_space.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/24/exchange_think_space.jpeg", "description": "Noelle Neff has only been in the position of library director at Keene Memorial library for a little more than a week, but she is already in the process of making big things happen at the facility.", "card": "summary", "title": "Library working to open Think Space in building"}, "Author": "SAM PIMPER", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "The company, run by Stacy Heatherly, will provide knowledge and training to help the Think Space get up and running.\nNeff, who formerly worked as a librarian in Phoenix, is in the process of bringing a Think Space to the second-floor of the library.\nThe Think Space will consist of a graphics and production studio - comprised of 3D printers, MacBook Computers, a sound and production studio and graphic design center, she said.\nI want to be part of the educational system.\u201dNeff believes that the library is the perfect place for a Think Take to be located.\nNeff said libraries across the country are shifting toward more technology-centered practices to help fully engage patrons who walk through its doors."}
