Bill Haslam\u2019s plan to extend health insurance to low-income, working Tennesseans under provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act. The plan was killed twice in Senate committees and failed to reach the floor of either the House or the Senate for full votes.\n\nCurrent lawmakers pay 20 percent of the total cost of their health insurance and the state pays 80 percent, the same level as full-time state employees.\n\nBut to continue their state health coverage after leaving or retiring from the state \u2014 a benefit more generous than many private-sector employees receive \u2014 regular state employees must have at least 10 years of service at the state or other covered government entities.\n\nFormer legislators could, technically, be eligible to maintain the subsidized health benefit after serving for one day as long as they won election to the legislature for one two-year House term, one four-year Senate term or for the remainder of an unexpired term. Longtime Memphis politician Sidney Chism is still enrolled in the state health plan although he served in the state Senate only 14 weeks and was never publicly elected. He was appointed by the County Commission to fill a Senate vacancy on Feb. 15, 2005, and held the seat until a special election was held May 24 of that year.\n\nThe 14-week service was insufficient to qualify Chism for a state pension, but it was sufficient to allow him to remain enrolled in the state health plan for life as long as he pays a premium equal to 40 percent of the cost. The following year, lawmakers approved a bill sponsored by then-state Sen. Steve Cohen, D-Memphis, requiring a member to be publicly elected rather than appointed to qualify for the lifetime health insurance benefit.\n\nCohen won election to Congress in 2006 \u2014 but remains enrolled in the state health plan, according to records obtained by The News-Sentinel and The Commercial Appeal under a public records act request.\n\nCohen served in the state Senate for 24 years, and dozens of the 148 former legislators still enrolled in the state health plan also served for decades. But others were lawmakers for as little as one two-year House term. Several sent on to become lobbyists. And others, like Cohen, moved to other publicly elected offices.\n\nKnox County Mayor Tim Burchett remains enrolled, as does former state Sen. Stacey Campfield of Knoxville, who voters turned out of office last November.\n\nFormer state Sen. Edgar Gillock of Memphis is enrolled; he left the legislature in 1982 after being convicted of taking $130,000 for his influence in awarding government contracts.\n\nFormer lawmakers who opt to remain covered pay premiums based on their length of service. Those with less than 20 years pay 40 percent of the cost of the insurance to the state, with the state paying the remainder. For 20 to 30 years of service, it\u2019s 30 percent. Those who served 30 or more years pay 20 percent.\n\nAs with state employees, the actual monthly premium for former lawmakers varies with the type of plan they select and whether they opt cover their spouse and dependents.\n\nNeither the state benefits administration office nor the office of legislative administration responded to questions about how much total premiums are paid by former lawmakers and how much the state pays to cover them. Last week, state officials told The Tennessean, in response to its public records request, that providing coverage to current lawmakers has cost the state nearly $5.8 million since 2008 while the legislators themselves paid $1.4 million.\n\nBecause the state has a self-funded group health insurance plan, taxpayers ultimately pick up the tab for the state\u2019s share of premiums, plus any health care costs that exceed the amounts paid in premiums and the plan\u2019s investment earnings.\n\nSenate Speaker Ron Ramsey, R-Blountville, defended the state health coverage for sitting lawmakers Wednesday. \u201cI do think the basic concept that we are state employees and therefore we get insurance while we\u2019re here, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. That\u2019s an apples and oranges comparison with Insure Tennessee.\u201d\n\nBut Ramsey said he doesn\u2019t know details of coverage for ex-legislators and how it compares to benefits available to regular state employees and to legislators in other states.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something I\u2019ll have to check into and get back with you,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 148\n\nAccording to state records obtained by The Commercial Appeal, here are the former state lawmakers covered by state insurance:\n\nRay Albright, Robert Arnold, John Arriola, Ben Atchley, Eddie Bass, Donald Bird, Harley Bittle, Steve Bivens, Sam Bone, James Boyer;\n\nRobert Briley, Henri Brooks, Tommie Brown, Frank Buck, Tim Burchett, Charlotte Burks, Robert Burleson, Harold Byrd, Dan Byrd, Marvin Caldwell;\n\nClinton Callicott, Scotty Campbell, Stacey Campfield, Joe Carr, Sidney Chism, Carol Chumney, Bill Clabough, Joseph Christopher Clem, James Cobb, Curtis Cobb;\n\nStephen Cobb, David Coffey, Stephen Cohen, William Coleman, Jerry Cooper, David Copeland, Floyd Crain, Christopher Crider, Jerry Cross, Ward Crutchfield;\n\nR.
