MISSOULA, Mont. (AP) - The Missoula County treasurer is assuring taxpayers that their identities have not been compromised after about 1,180 people got tax notices, along with the names and email addresses of the other people who had requested to be notified when their taxes were due.

County treasurer Tyler Gernant said it was a breach of trust, and he assured people there was no additional risk of a data breach.

Gernant said tax bills were sent out in October, and some taxpayers were asked to provide their email addresses if they wanted to be reminded when it was time to pay second-half taxes. The emails that included others was inadvertent and the result of a computer mistake, he said.

“Obviously that was not our intention,” Gernant said.

His office sent out an apology, saying he and his staff were “truly agonizing over our breach of your trust.”

He urged people to contact his office if they had any problems caused by the mistake, the Missoulian reported (http://tinyurl.com/jnltrbr ).

The addresses of those who requested the notification were entered by hand into a spreadsheet and sent to the county’s GroupWise email system.

A deputy treasurer mistakenly included the entire group contact list in the message sent to the taxpayers.

“We had a couple of people who brought it to our attention, and for the most part they were nice,” Gernant said. “We felt like it was probably necessary to send out the email to say it wasn’t tied to any of our information systems.

“The only damage would be that somebody saw your email address. I definitely don’t discount that.”
