The tribal government, which owned the casino, distributed a portion of its profits to every adult in the tribe\u2014about $4,000 per person per year. For parents, the extra income was a relief, as well as an opportunity to invest in their kids, especially those with behavioral issues.\n\nThe results were significant: Emotional and behavioral health improved among the children, particularly for those who\u2019d been struggling more than their peers. Relationships between parents and between parents and kids strengthened. Some families were even able to move to neighborhoods with higher income levels and better educational opportunities.\n\nThese are the findings of a new NBER working paper, which analyses the results of a longitudinal survey of western North Carolina children, both Cherokee and non-Cherokee. The benefits that the reliable extra cash offered the Cherokee families add to the argument for universal basic income. Besides improving outcomes for kids, a 2013 article in the Atlantic made the case that if the federal government wrote an annual $3,000 check to every American\u2014adults and children, rich and poor\u2014we could cut poverty rates in half.\n\nAnother NBER working paper released this month addresses a different approach to improving life outcomes for kids that\u2019s gaining much more traction among state and federal policymakers: Universal childcare. Its findings actually make a universal basic income seem even more appealing. (Matt Yglesias was the first to point this out on Vox.)\n\nCo-authored by one of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s chief architects, the paper studies the long-term effects of Quebec\u2019s daycare program, \u201cNorth America\u2019s best known experiment in universal preschool care and education.\u201d Contrary to what you might expect, it shows that children exposed to the program have suffered significant negative behavioral and emotional effects.\n\nHigh demand for childcare diluted the quality of the subsidized programs.\n\nAmong eligible young children, the authors found that the Quebec program lead to increases in anxiety and aggression. There was \"a significant worsening in self-reported health and in life satisfaction among teens\" who\u2019d been exposed for the program. And compared to children in other provinces, the Quebec cohort also showed a \"sharp and contemporaneous increase in criminal behavior\u201d as they entered adolescence.\n\nThe program, which was introduced in 1997, wasn\u2019t a complete disaster. By providing heavily subsidized slots in nonprofit daycare programs to any working parent in Quebec, it was successful by some measures: Adults\u2019 participation in the labor force, especially among mothers of young kids, increased significantly. And enrollment in the program boomed.\n\nBut their kids suffered, winding up worse off than peers who\u2019d never had daycare at all. It seems that the high demand for slots diluted the quality of the children\u2019s care: After highly rated nonprofit programs filled up, the government had to resort more and more to lower-rated private and in-home services.\n\nQuebec\u2019s system is probably distinct from what the U.S. might offer, if universal childcare was ever adopted here. And the NBER study has yet to be published; among the many variables that intervene in children\u2019s lives between daycare and adolescence, there could certainly something that the researchers missed that affect these results.\n\nNevertheless, there is an important lesson here: When supply and funding are limited, it\u2019s extremely hard to maintain quality at such a large scale. And if you can\u2019t offer the same care or educational experience to every child\u2014something that\u2019s truly \u201cuniversal\u201d\u2014you should probably rethink the approach. That\u2019s the basis of most criticism of universal pre-K and childcare here in the U.S., where paltry state and federal funds have already helped created a crisis in K-12 education.\n\n\"You have to look at the trade-off,\" Darleen Opfer, education director at the RAND Corporation, told the Atlantic in 2014. \"If you have a state that can\u2019t afford high-quality preschool for everyone, where does the investment really make sense? To me it\u2019s not an issue of whether or not [pre-K is] a good thing\u2026 The clashes come over how to do it.\"\n\nAt least in the short-term, h igh-quality pre-K and daycare programs are good for young kids.\n\nCityLab has often trumpeted the benefits of universal pre-K and daycare, especially for low-income families. One 2013 piece explained:\n\n[M]ounting evidence suggests that we should be front-loading our investment in the most disadvantaged children during the ages 2-4, when their brains develop at an extremely high rate, and while they're learning social, motivational, cognitive and analytical skills\u2026 And the earlier society in invests in children, the greater the return we get.\n\nBut maybe we should be more careful about what it means for society to invest in children. Research shows that, at least in the short-term, high-quality pre-K and daycare programs are good for young kids. They\u2019re especially good for disadvantaged children, when they\u2019re targeted to them. But when the quality of care suffers, it\u2019s only logical that the kids do, too.\n\nAnother thought: Instead of investing billions of dollars in daycare that is only universal in name\u2014not in quality\u2014maybe we should just give that money to people.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An experiment in universal childcare in Quebec has been mostly a disaster.
