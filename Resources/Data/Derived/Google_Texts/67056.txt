DUBLIN (AP) - Catholic leaders and gay rights activists alike are calling the gay marriage vote in Ireland a sign of a "social revolution."

More than three out of five voters gave their approval to changing the nation's constitution to allow same-sex marriage. Ireland becomes the first country to approve gay marriage in a popular national vote.

Many gay couples are taking the opportunity to declare their intentions, or to renew their vows after being married earlier in another country.

The archbishop of Dublin says the Catholic church "needs to do a reality check." He says the rejection of church teaching means Catholic leaders need to urgently find a new message and voice for reaching Ireland's young.

Analysts credited the "yes" side with adeptly employing social media to mobilize young voters, tens of thousands of whom voted for the first time Friday.
