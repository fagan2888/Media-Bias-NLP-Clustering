Lawmakers in Massachusetts and municipalities across the country with similar measures in place will now have to figure out \u2014 once again \u2014 how best to ensure that the people who need to enter and exit clinics can continue to do so without being harassed, threatened, harmed or worse by antiabortion protesters. There have been nearly 7,000 incidences of clinic violence since 1977; history teaches us that safety is never a given when walking through those doors.\n\nThe second thing that the opinion in McCullen v. Coakley reminds us is how empty \u2014 how absolutely devoid of meaning \u2014 the notion of \u201cwomen\u2019s safety\u201d has become in politics. Hardly a week passes without some measure advancing through a state legislature that will have devastating consequences for women\u2019s health, but these bills are nonetheless cloaked in the language of women\u2019s safety. Put those words in front of almost any piece of legislation and it seems like most lawmakers just nod their heads.\n\nTexas comes to mind. We\u2019re one year out from Wendy Davis\u2019 historic filibuster, and the status of access in the state has gone from bad to utterly catastrophic. Nearly half of Texas\u2019 abortion clinics have closed since 2011; it is estimated that come September, there will only be six abortion providers left in the second most populous state in the nation. The Rio Grande Valley has lost its last remaining abortion clinic, and now women in the region must travel 300 miles round trip to access care, including routine services like mammograms, cancer screenings and birth control. A recent study found that 7 percent of women in Texas have attempted to self-induce abortion. The number jumps to 12 percent for women who live along the Mexican border, and it is expected to grow. Women who have the luxury of crossing border checkpoints without fearing deportation or worse have been traveling to flea markets in Mexico to buy drugs from unlicensed and unregulated vendors in order to terminate their pregnancies.\n\nBut state Rep. Jodi Laubenberg called the passage of HB 2 a victory for women\u2019s safety. In reflecting on the year that was, she commented, \u201cAuthoring and passing House Bill 2 was one of the most rewarding and challenging accomplishments of my legislative service. [\u2026] It was worth it. I will continue to fight for both the safety of Texas women and the pre-born.\u201d Her Republican colleagues echoed the sentiment. Republican state Rep. Jane Nelson said, \u201cI am proud to support House Bill 2, which not only protects innocent life but also ensures that abortion facilities are safe for Texas women.\u201d And state Rep. Patricia Harless used the same language to justify her vote. \u201cI proudly voted for House Bill 2 because I believe Texas women deserve more than the bare minimum, lowest level safety standards,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the GOP defends bad laws with talk of \"women's health,\" SCOTUS just killed a law that actually protects women", "title": "The right\u2019s cynical wordplay: \u201cWomen\u2019s safety\u201d means absolutely nothing anymore!", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "As the GOP defends bad laws with talk of \"women's health,\" SCOTUS just killed a law that actually protects women", "title": "The right\u2019s cynical wordplay: \u201cWomen\u2019s safety\u201d means absolutely nothing anymore!", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/27/the_rights_cynical_wordplay_womens_safety_means_absolutely_nothing_anymore/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/antiabortion_protest-620x4121.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As the GOP defends bad laws with talk of \"women's health,\" SCOTUS just killed a law that actually protects women", "title": "The right\u2019s cynical wordplay: \u201cWomen\u2019s safety\u201d means absolutely nothing anymore!", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/antiabortion_protest-620x4121.jpg", "creator": "@kmcdonovgh", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Katie McDonough", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Abortion, Abortion clinics, abortion restrictions, abortion rights, First Amendment, Free Speech, SCOTUS, Texas, TRAP laws, Women's Health, women's safety", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The second thing that the opinion in McCullen v.
