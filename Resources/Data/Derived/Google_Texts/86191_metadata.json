Schaeffer Center Associate Director and USC Price Associate Professor Julie Zissimopoulos presented her research on the value of delaying Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, while USC Price Assistant Professor Vivian Wu served as the discussant in several sessions related to health care costs. Erin Trish, a Schaeffer Center postdoctoral fellow, presented her research on how regulation of the small group market affects firm self-insurance and its implications for the ACA.\n\nAlice Chen, who is joining USC Price as an assistant professor in the fall, won ASHEcon\u2019s student paper award for her research examining whether the poor benefit from more generous Medicaid physician payments.\n\nGoldman, who co-authored eight papers used in the conference, moderated a plenary discussion on innovative models in payment reform featuring the four Leonard D. Schaeffer chairs from across the country. Discussant Michael Chernew, Leonard D. Schaeffer Professor of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School, called it the most important policy reform going forward to maintain pressure on the fee-for-service model. Others agreed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we have much argument in this room that we need an alternative for fee-for-service that will evolve over time to produce a higher quality of care at a sustainable cost and will be broadly acceptable to the patients, providers and taxpayers,\u201d said Alice Rivlin, director of the Engelberg Center for Health Care Reform at the Brookings Institution.\n\nThere are many payment models being tested. Accountable care organizations are a pay-for-performance alternative in which a group of health care providers serve a group of patients and share in the savings if they can meet quality standards and reduce spending. Another option is to bundle payments that cover all health care services related to a procedure. These emerging payment models are works in progress with mixed results.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of the time period we live in is there\u2019s a vast number of different models, and so there\u2019s an enormous amount of work to be done to understand which models are working,\u201d Chernew said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to simply be one answer. There\u2019s going to be such diversity in where we move ahead, that there\u2019s going to be enormous amount of opportunity for academics to look at it in a rigorous way.\u201d\n\nBehavioral economics\n\nIn a discussion on behavioral economics, Jason Doctor, director of Health Informatics at the Schaeffer Center, noted that another payment model \u2014 pay for performance \u2014 hasn\u2019t been as effective as hoped, working only 25 percent of the time while causing nonincentivized areas to get worse.\n\nOne behavioral perspective is that providers are interested in how they are viewed by their peers, so that social influences can be as important as financial ones to improve patient outcomes. Doctor presented a study that applied this principle to antibiotic prescribing \u2014 giving clinicians monthly feedback on their performance relative to their peers \u2014 and found that it resulted in a significant reduction of inappropriate prescribing.\n\n\u201cThese results that we\u2019re getting suggest that the effects of nonmonetary incentives are substantial and should be taken seriously,\u201d Doctor said. \u201cCertainly we should also consider the larger social environment, how clinicians interact with each other and how that might affect their behavior.\u201d\n\nThe opening plenary titled \u201cThe Affordable Care Act: What Have We Learned and What Is Next?\u201d featured two economists with opposing viewpoints on the future of the ACA.\n\nCasey Mulligan, an economics professor at the University of Chicago, said the ACA will shrink the labor market by 3 percent and reduce the gross domestic product by 2 percent. He projects that by 2017, the labor market will be between a half percent and quarter percent smaller.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going toward quite a bit smaller, Congress reacts to that,\u201d Mulligan said. \u201cThey look at the economy going south, and they\u2019re going to want to do something. Is it going to be to light the ACA on fire or to double down with more assistance for unemployed and poor people?\u201d\n\nPeter Orszag, an executive at Citigroup who previously served as director of the Office of Management and Budget for the Obama administration, was more optimistic about the ACA and also touched on payment reform.\n\nHe cited a slowdown in Medicare spending this year, which he attributed to providers anticipating the movement away from the fee-for-service structure, the digitizing of systems and movement toward a defined contribution model in employer-sponsored insurance. Today, about 90 percent of health payments in the United States are fee-for-service, but Orszag expects that to go down to 40 to 60 percent within three years.\n\nMore stories about: Affordable Care Act, Health Policy", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://news.usc.edu/64769/national-health-economics-conference-looks-at-future-of-the-affordable-care-act/", "image": {"width": 300, "secure_url": "https://news.usc.edu/files/2014/07/Dana-Goldman-300x200.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "identifier": "http://news.usc.edu/files/2014/07/Dana-Goldman-300x200.jpg", "height": 200}, "type": "article", "description": "Schaeffer Center hosts forum for national officials with an interest in health policy.", "title": "Health economics conference looks at future of the Affordable Care Act"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0387\"", "article_summary": "More stories about: Affordable Care Act, Health Policy\nAnother option is to bundle payments that cover all health care services related to a procedure.\nAccountable care organizations are a pay-for-performance alternative in which a group of health care providers serve a group of patients and share in the savings if they can meet quality standards and reduce spending.\nDiscussant Michael Chernew, Leonard D.
