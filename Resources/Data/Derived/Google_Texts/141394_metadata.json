As Salon reported Thursday morning, workers at Peacock Productions have attempted to land meetings with MSNBC\u2019s top hosts in an effort to win their support \u2014 and successfully managed to meet with Chris Hayes, while Schultz gave Salon a comment that elicited some negative reactions.\n\nIn response, Schultz addressed the matter in the first segments of his radio show Thursday afternoon, professing his vocal support for organized labor and slamming Salon\u2019s reporting, but not specifically addressing alleged union-busting by the NBC Universal-owned company Peacock Productions.\n\n\u201cAre they that freaking stupid that they don\u2019t know where I stand?\u201d Schultz asked listeners. \u201cWow.\u201d Schultz also suggested he wasn\u2019t necessarily \u201cable to influence\u201d someone \u201cof authority,\u201d and asked \u201cwhy should I put myself in jeopardy through an email?\u201d\n\nAs Salon reported Thursday morning, workers at Peacock Productions charge that after they started organizing with the Writers Guild of America\u2013East, the company held mandatory group and one-on-one anti-union meetings; suggested that unionization could lead to the company being dissolved; discouraged employees from talking to pro-union co-workers; discriminated against pro-union workers in assigning work; and used a spurious legal argument to get the results of a union election impounded by the National Labor Relations Board. (NBC has not provided comment on those allegations, following a series of inquiries since Tuesday.) In response, the AFL-CIO posted a petition, hosted by MoveOn Civic Action, asking for public support from five prime-time MSNBC hosts: Chris Hayes, Rachel Maddow, Lawrence O\u2019Donnell, Al Sharpton and Schultz.\n\nWhile none of the hosts publicly declared support for the the campaign, several people who were in the room told Salon that Hayes recently met privately with Peacock Productions workers at the WGA-E office and heard their concerns. Hayes, Maddow, O\u2019Donnell and Sharpton did not respond to inquiries for Thursday\u2019s story.\n\nBut Schultz sent a two-sentence response to Salon\u2019s request for comment on WGA-E\u2019s request for his support: \u201cMoveon.org has never been an ally of Ed Schultz, why should I help you with a story? Give me a reason.\u201d He did not respond to a follow-up email. (MoveOn did not immediately reply to a Thursday afternoon inquiry.)\n\nSchultz\u2019s response, printed in Thursday\u2019s article, drew him some criticism on Twitter.\n\nOn his Thursday afternoon national radio show, Schultz defended himself and critiqued his critics. At the start of his three-hour show (not affiliated with MSNBC), he told listeners they could call in if \u201cyou want to talk to me directly. Maybe you\u2019ve seen something in the Twitter world that \u2026 you\u2019re not really sure about \u2026\u201d He said he was \u201cnot gonna punch down,\u201d and that he had \u201calways supported people when it comes to collective bargaining\u201d and \u201cnever wavered one bit ever.\u201d\n\nThen Schultz said, \u201cIf you\u2019ve got issues or you\u2019d like to call me on something, this is the format \u2013 you\u2019re not gonna see me on anybody else\u2019s television show, you\u2019re not gonna hear me on anybody\u2019s else\u2019s radio show \u2013 I have plenty to do.\u201d He said there were \u201ca lot of things out there that people don\u2019t know what the hell they\u2019re talking about,\u201d and that he couldn\u2019t \u201cclear the breach with one phone call\u201d or \u201cone returned tweet,\u201d but \u201cI can be here consistently to give you a real sense of who I am, what I believe in, and cutting right to the chase.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so that\u2019s where I\u2019m going to leave all the nastiness that is out there,\u201d Schultz went on, \u201cand I\u2019m not going to lower myself to people who just have got employment envy, income envy, exposure envy, platform envy.\u201d He warned that \u201cthere are going to be minions out there that are going to twist and turn and spin and have expectations without going to the source.\u201d Schultz then turned to the phones (\u201cvery seldom do I take calls in the very first segment,\u201d he noted, \u201cbut I\u2019m willing to do that today\u201d). After indicating no calls immediately arrived, Schultz said sarcastically, \u201cYou mean they don\u2019t want to take on Big Eddie here? I mean, I just find that hard to believe.\u201d\n\nA minute later, Schultz took a call from someone asking if it was true that he\u2019d \u201ctaken a quarter million dollars from the unions to be their spokesman\u201d over two years; Schultz answered he was \u201cnot taking anything from anybody,\u201d but \u201cif people want to advertise on my website, am I supposed to shut my business down?\u201d\n\nSchultz\u2019s second caller asked him, \u201cWhy is Josh Eidelson [the author of this piece] not on your show today instead of hiding behind Twitter about a controversy that\u2019s trying to pit progressive media against progressive media?\u201d (Note: I had not been invited on Schultz\u2019s show.) After Schultz asked who he was talking about and the caller described the morning story about Hayes\u2019 meeting with Peacock Productions workers, Schultz said, \u201cI don\u2019t advertise every meeting that I have. No one knows who I\u2019ve met with. No one.\u201d Schultz then asked, \u201cDo you think the management and ownership\u201d of MSNBC and his radio show \u201cknow who Ed Schultz is? Do you think they know what I stand for? Do they think they know what my position is? Of course they do. Absolutely they do. It is unvarnished, OK? It is \u2013 it is unvarnished.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Knocking \"media wannabes,\" MSNBC host Ed Schultz addresses criticism of his response to alleged NBC union-busting", "title": "My critics have \u201cincome envy\u201d: Ed Schultz unloads after backlash to his union quote", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Knocking \"media wannabes,\" MSNBC host Ed Schultz addresses criticism of his response to alleged NBC union-busting", "title": "My critics have \u201cincome envy\u201d: Ed Schultz unloads after backlash to his union quote", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/13/my_critics_have_income_envy_ed_schultz_unloads_after_backlash_to_his_union_quote/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/ed_schultz.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Knocking \"media wannabes,\" MSNBC host Ed Schultz addresses criticism of his response to alleged NBC union-busting", "title": "My critics have \u201cincome envy\u201d: Ed Schultz unloads after backlash to his union quote", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/ed_schultz.jpg", "creator": "@josheidelson", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Josh Eidelson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Al Sharpton, Chris Hayes, Ed Schultz, Labor, law, lawrence o'donnell, Media Criticism, MSNBC, Rachel Maddow, union busting, Unions, Writers", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cAre they that freaking stupid that they don\u2019t know where I stand?\u201d Schultz asked listeners.\nNo one.\u201d Schultz then asked, \u201cDo you think the management and ownership\u201d of MSNBC and his radio show \u201cknow who Ed Schultz is?\nAfter Schultz asked who he was talking about and the caller described the morning story about Hayes\u2019 meeting with Peacock Productions workers, Schultz said, \u201cI don\u2019t advertise every meeting that I have.\nAfter indicating no calls immediately arrived, Schultz said sarcastically, \u201cYou mean they don\u2019t want to take on Big Eddie here?\nOn his Thursday afternoon national radio show, Schultz defended himself and critiqued his critics."}
