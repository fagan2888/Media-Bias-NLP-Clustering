The spot price on the Dominion South trading point in Southwestern Pennsylvania hit 71 cents per million British thermal units on July 2, which Viswanath said was a record low.\n\nBy last week it rebounded to $1.35, but that was less than half the price garnered at the Chicago Citygate trading point, $2.89.\n\nProducers who cannot get their gas on the few lines leading from Pennsylvania to Chicago don't get that better price.\n\nThe first turn of the relief valve started Aug. 1 when Tallgrass Energy Partners reversed flow on a big section of its Rockies Express (REX) Pipeline. Designed to carry gas from the west before the Marcellus shale became so productive, the line can now take it from Clarington on the Ohio River west.\n\nCecil-based Rice Energy, which contracts to put its gas on the line, expects to \u201cpresumably see an immediate step up in higher realized price as compared to those volumes previously being sold into the Appalachia markets,\u201d CEO Daniel Rice IV said.\n\nThe project should help people on both ends of the pipe. Producers get a little more for their gas, and the price for consumers in the Midwest drops.\n\n\u201cThat Midwest market is very important,\u201d Viswanath said, especially in the fall, winter and spring, when a huge percentage of homes there use gas for heating. More power plants there are switching to gas, too.\n\nAnother major project coming online in November should move more gas west just as winter demand ramps up.\n\nSpectra Energy's Uniontown to Gas City project will get gas from Greene and Washington counties west to Indiana, where the Panhandle Eastern system can send it around the Midwest.\n\nFort Worth-based Range Resources Corp. has enough space contracted on the pipeline to carry about 28 percent of the gas it produced last quarter from Marcellus wells in Southwestern Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cThis should increase our realized price by approximately $1 (per million BTUs) on this production,\u201d Range CEO Jeff Ventura told analysts on a recent conference call. \u201cThe uplift from this project is expected to have a significant impact on our Southwest Marcellus realized pricing for future periods.\u201d\n\nCombined with other projects, having REX and Spectra come online will mean pipelines at the end of the year will carry an additional 6 billion cubic feet of gas per day, compared with the beginning of 2015. After adding another 6 billion cubic feet next year, projects in 2017 are projected to increase pipeline capacity by 16 billion cubic feet.\n\n\u201cThat's when they really turn the corner, in 2017,\u201d Viswanath said. \u201cThese are small steps now that will give relief. 2017 is the silver bullet.\u201d\n\nDavid Conti is a Trib Total Media staff writer.
