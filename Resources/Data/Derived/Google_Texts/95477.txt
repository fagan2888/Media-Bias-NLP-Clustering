Listen to the national talking heads discuss health care and you see two distinct positions. One is that health care has never been more accessible and that any increase in cost is negligible. The other perspective points out massive increases in cost, doctors leaving the system and insurance companies starting to abandon a sinking ship. It's as if fans of the Affordable Care Act live in a different world than everyone else. At least both sides agree things are changing.

In the Minot area, there is definitely a change coming in terms of health care. Or rather, changes and it's a good idea that people prepare for whatever that change may bring.

We know that longtime landmark health-care provider Trinity Health has a big change in its sites. This summer, architectural work will be under way for its proposed new campus in southwest Minot. However, until then, the cost of the planned opening won't even be known, leaving Trinity in position to then make the financial plans to see the dream realized.

Meanwhile, Sanford Health continues to assert its interests in the Minot market and apparently has its eye on a sizable location not far from the proposed Trinity site. Sanford, with its deep pockets and pattern of partnering with other providers in many of the markets it enters, is in no hurry to make a move. With the regional economy in a standstill and a national election that could certainly impact health care on the horizon, it's little surprise Sanford is waiting to make its best possible move.

Also recently, CHI St. Alexius expanded its footprint in Minot.

Can Minot support all the institutions with plans here? What if the economy doesn't quickly bounce back? Is there a possibility of a partnership somehow?
