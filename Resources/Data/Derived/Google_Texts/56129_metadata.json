Polls show a tight contest, with Democratic incumbent Kay Hagan and her Republican opponent Thom Tillis exchanging slim leads. It\u2019s not even clear what the November midterm will be about.\n\nIs it a nationalized election, with Hagan tied to a president with low approval numbers? Will Tillis, speaker of the North Carolina House, be weighed down with dissatisfaction over a sometimes dysfunctional state legislature? Will the economy be the ruling issue or will education, health care and the environment, major North Carolina concerns, rise in importance? What role will social issues \u2014 abortion and same-sex marriage \u2014 play in turning out the base in both parties?\n\nIf this past week was an indication, the answer is maybe \u2013 or perhaps, all of the above.\n\nHagan has her own story to tell, which she did briefly at the American Legion convention in Charlotte on Tuesday in front of an audience of veterans. North Carolina, which she calls the nation\u2019s most military friendly state, is home to 770,000 veterans and 116,000 active-duty troops, a major voting bloc.\n\nHagan, a member of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, has familial military connections: a Vietnam veteran husband, a father-in-law who was a Marine general, a brother and father with Navy service and nephews who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan. She has worked across party lines with North Carolina\u2019s Republican Sen. Richard Burr, who preceded her as convention speaker, on issues to benefit the military, including efforts, she said, \u201cto bring justice to the Marines who were affected by contaminated water at Camp Lejeune.\u201d She touted her months-long work \u2014 including direct contact with and chiding of the president \u2014 to reduce wait times at the VA by facilitating leases in Fayetteville and Jacksonville. She criticized the Obama administration, which she said \u201chas a long road ahead to restore the faith and trust of our veterans.\u201d\n\nHagan also took a swipe at Tillis, though not by name, when she said the state legislature made it easier \u201cfor predatory lenders to take advantage of hard-working military families.\u201d\n\nThe Tillis campaign said in a statement that \u201cKay Hagan and President Obama have broken their promises to our veterans, allowing the issues plaguing the VA to get significantly worse under their watch. Hagan has rubber-stamped President Obama\u2019s reckless policies, which have weakened us at home and emboldened our enemies abroad, creating one crisis after another.\u201d\n\nThat followed a pattern, as Tillis seldom fails to mention Obama when the subject is Hagan, who followed the nation\u2019s commander in chief on the American Legion program on Tuesday. (A respectful but not overly enthusiastic crowd took a wait-and see attitude on the VA reforms the president announced.) Before the day was out, the Tillis campaign had sent out a photo of Hagan\u2019s cordial tarmac greeting with the president, though it didn\u2019t mention that Republican Burr was there as well.\n\nTillis would no doubt be happy with the reaction of Curtis Leary, 78, of Cary, N.C., a Coast Guard veteran who said Obama\u2019s speech was \u201cgood\u201d before he sarcastically gave credit not to the president but to \u201cthe guy who wrote it.\u201d He said he was disappointed in Hagan\u2019s vote for the Affordable Care Act, and would vote for Tillis.\n\nBut Brenda Galbreath, a member of the American Legion Auxiliary, who volunteers with the VA medical center in Fayetteville, had a different view. Galbreath, whose father served in Korea and Vietnam, said she was appreciative of what the president said. \u201cIt was an honor to have him here,\u201d she said. \u201cHagan\u2019s record with veterans is good; Tillis is pandering.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, social issues were in the spotlight at the Charlotte stop for a \u201cSummer of Life\u201d tour, held on the sidewalk in front of Hagan\u2019s office in the city. A noontime crowd of about 60 focused specially on a Senate bill introduced by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and known as the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, banning abortions after 20 weeks except in cases of rape or incest or when the mother\u2019s life is in danger. The tour plans to travel to other states \u2014 including Colorado and Arkansas \u2014 with close Senate races.\n\nThe North Carolina Values Coalition and the Susan B. Anthony List joined Students for Life of America, Family Research Council Action and Concerned Women for America in an hour-long program that featured speakers from the groups and also David and Jason Benham, conservatives who lost a proposed HGTV show because of remarks and views on homosexuality.\n\nThe groups want to outlaw abortions, \u201cabsolutely, 100 percent,\u201d said Tami Fitzgerald of the N.C. Values Coalition and state director for Women Speak Out PAC, a partner of the Susan B. Anthony List, which has a team of more than 130 canvassing voters across the state, according to a spokesperson, and working to defeat Hagan.\n\nFitzgerald, who is based in Raleigh, told She the People: \u201cWe don\u2019t need people in Washington who are going to continue to send our taxpayer dollars to radical organizations like Planned Parenthood.\u201d Tillis has said he favors Graham\u2019s bill and believes abortion should be illegal except to save the life of the mother, and in cases of rape and incest.\n\nHagan\u2019s campaign told She the People: \u201cKay believes these are difficult and complex decisions that should be left to women to make with the doctor, their family and their faith.\u201d She has the support and endorsement of EMILY\u2019s List, which is dedicated to recruiting, training and electing pro-abortion rights Democratic women.\n\nAn Elon University poll of registered voters taken in late April found 44 percent of North Carolinians feel state laws should make access to abortion less difficult compared to 40 percent who said it should be made more difficult. A wave of conservative state legislation has, among other restrictions, tightened regulations on abortion clinics.\n\nThursday marked the planned conclusion of a \u201cMoral Week of Action,\u201d in North Carolina and a coalition of other states, a continuation of \u201cMoral Monday\u201d gatherings to protest the state legislature\u2019s action. Each day of marches around the capitol focused on an issue, from education to economic justice to Thursday\u2019s scheduled \u201cVote Your Dreams, Not Your Fears\u201d rally for voting rights.\n\nThe Rev. William Barber II, president of the North Carolina NAACP, said in a statement, \u201cFor the past six days, we have seen people in North Carolina and all across the country stand up and speak out against the state legislatures and governors who are stripping them of their rights, threatening their health and livelihoods and privileging corporate well-being above their own.\u201d\n\nWill voters who agree be moved to go to the polls? Barber has been leading voter registration efforts across the state this summer.\n\nAll this activity weeks before the election is happening against a backdrop of ads financed by outside money, a sure sign that North Carolina could be the key to control of the U.S. Senate.\n\nAs the two major party candidates continue to fight it out, they also can\u2019t lose sights of quirky Libertarian candidate Sean Haugh, who is usually polling in single digits \u2014 too low to win but possibly just high enough to affect what will happen in November.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Opponents trade charges, protests hit issues from abortion to voting rights, polls tighten -- just another week in a race that could decide Senate control.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Opponents trade charges, protests hit issues from abortion to voting rights, polls tighten -- just another week in a race that could decide Senate control.", "title": "Obama visit adds heat to contentious and crucial North Carolina Senate race", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2014/08/29/obama-visit-adds-heat-to-contentious-and-crucial-north-carolina-senate-race/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/WashingtonPost/Content/Blogs/post-politics/Images/Senate_North_Carolina_Hagan-09c7f.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mcurtisnc3"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2014/08/29/obama-visit-adds-heat-to-contentious-and-crucial-north-carolina-senate-race/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "President Obama, American Legion, veterans, abortion, Kay Hagan, Thom Tillis", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "President Obama, American Legion, veterans, abortion, Kay Hagan, Thom Tillis"}, "article_summary": "Will the economy be the ruling issue or will education, health care and the environment, major North Carolina concerns, rise in importance?\nPresident Obama visits Charlotte on Aug. 26 and is greeted by both North Carolina senators \u2014 Democrat Kay Hagan and Republican Richard Burr.\nWill Tillis, speaker of the North Carolina House, be weighed down with dissatisfaction over a sometimes dysfunctional state legislature?\n(AP Photo/Charles Dharapak)About the only thing that\u2019s certain about North Carolina\u2019s crucial Senate race is that it\u2019s close.\nNorth Carolina, which she calls the nation\u2019s most military friendly state, is home to 770,000 veterans and 116,000 active-duty troops, a major voting bloc."}
