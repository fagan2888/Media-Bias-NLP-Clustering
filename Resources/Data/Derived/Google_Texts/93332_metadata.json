If you didn\u2019t believe that, witness the latest kerfuffle over vaccines. Once the province of doctors' offices and parenting blogs, vaccines have come front and center in the political arena over the last few days, and the Leftmedia are using it to bash the GOP.\n\nTwo likely 2016 presidential contenders, Chris Christie and Rand Paul, answered questions about vaccines in the wake of the recent outbreak of measles at Disneyland. They both might have been better off with a \u201cno comment\u201d than to wade into such a \u201cgotcha\u201d issue for a Leftmedia hungry to discredit anti-Science\u2122 Republicans.\n\nThough Christie extolled the benefits of vaccination, he said there must be \u201csome measure of choice\u201d in the matter. Paul argued that most vaccines should be voluntary: \u201cThe state doesn\u2019t own your children. Parents own the children. And it is an issue of freedom and public health.\u201d That thought came after he relayed scary but discredited anecdotes involving \u201cmany tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines.\u201d\n\nThe Republicans' comments followed Barack Obama\u2019s pontification on the issue: \u201cYou should get your kids vaccinated. The science is, you know, pretty indisputable. We\u2019ve looked at this again and again. There is every reason to get vaccinated, but there aren\u2019t reasons to not.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a shade different from Obama\u2019s stance in 2008, however, when he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve seen just a skyrocketing autism rate. Some people are suspicious that it\u2019s connected to the vaccines. \u2026 The science is right now inconclusive, but we have to research it.\u201d Perhaps he settled the science during his first term.\n\nLikewise in 2008, Hillary Clinton and John McCain pointed to vaccines as a possible cause of autism. McCain said there was \u201cstrong evidence\u201d of a connection, and Clinton promised to \u201cmake investments to find the causes of autism, including possible environmental causes like vaccines.\u201d\n\nAs for \u201cinvestments,\u201d Obama\u2019s latest budget cuts $50 million from a vaccine program for the underinsured. That\u2019s inconvenient.\n\nSo now that we\u2019ve established a bipartisan problem, we\u2019ll make a few observations.\n\nScience is rarely \u201csettled\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s the point of scientific inquiry. As we often note, climate change is likely happening, but the science is not at all clear on its cause or extent or what we can do about it. Whether eating eggs or too much salt is bad for you has been the subject of years of rigorous debate. Vaccines were created thanks to research and study \u2013 and there\u2019s no reason to end such work, or to deny that we don\u2019t know everything.\n\nThat said, fears about vaccine risks are often overblown. The Wall Street Journal reports, \u201cThe claims about vaccine risks go back to a 1998 article in The Lancet in which British doctor Andrew Wakefield claimed to have found a link between the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism. But the real menace was Mr. Wakefield, whose findings were proven to be fraudulent and who was on the payroll of the plaintiffs' bar. The Lancet retracted the article in 2010, and Mr. Wakefield lost his medical license.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s indisputable that vaccines have been remarkably effective in virtually eradicating communicable diseases that once claimed numerous lives. Measles was declared eliminated in 2000, but international travelers brought it here again, where it spread at Disneyland among the unvaccinated.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear that some children cannot receive vaccinations due to illnesses such as leukemia, and there are indeed perfectly legitimate reasons to forgo vaccinations or to space them out. Parents should research the issue and be as knowledgeable as possible. That includes finding a trustworthy doctor.\n\nThose who opt out of vaccines benefit from what\u2019s known as herd immunity. In other words, as long as about 90% of people are vaccinated, the \u201cmore-enlightened\u201d few may choose to avoid doing so and suffer little consequence. But there is a mathematical limit to this gamble, and it\u2019s often upper-class liberals who are rolling the dice.\n\nWealthy schools in Los Angeles now feature vaccination rates as low as South Sudan. As a result, there\u2019s a resurgence of measles and whooping cough. The California counties surrounding San Francisco (which went for Obama by 84% in 2012) also have especially low vaccination rates.\n\nBut remember, it\u2019s Republicans who are anti-Science\u2122.\n\nSome on the Right do oppose government mandates for vaccinations, but the vast majority of conservatives still vaccinate (and all 50 states have varying degrees of mandate). Most of the time it\u2019s not actually an issue of personal liberty; it\u2019s one of public health and individual responsibility. As 19th century physician Oliver Wendell Holmes put it, \u201cThe right to swing my fist ends where the other man\u2019s nose begins.\u201d The choice to refuse vaccination \u2013 when rooted in vain conceit rather than medical reality \u2013 endangers others.\n\nVaccinations are a very good idea, and, because many people lack common sense, the use of state power through carrots and sticks is not excessive. It was Thomas Jefferson writing in the Declaration of Independence who said, \u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men.\u201d\n\nFinally, the issue for both sides of the political aisle boils down to trust in government. Whether it\u2019s global warming, NSA surveillance, IRS audits, ObamaCare or vaccinations, many Americans just don\u2019t think government officials are playing it straight or telling the truth. Most of the time, this distrust is founded in legitimately bad experience. ObamaCare in particular can be blamed for the rising mistrust in medicine.\n\nUnless and until that trust is restored, a growing number of people will eschew good health choices, and, as a result, we may be looking toward a future full of diseases we only thought we had beaten.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Leftmedia tries again to paint Republicans as anti-science.", "csrf-token": "Jd60VYhBMHTdap4VcnQHsVlEENnVU/q4n++AXkbJrWQ=", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The Patriot Post", "description": "The Leftmedia tries again to paint Republicans as anti-science.", "title": "Politicizing Vaccination", "url": "http://patriotpost.us/articles/32895", "image": "http://assets.patriotpost.us/images/2015-02-04-f83bfe44.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002378661032, "app_id": 217327155053459}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0cab\"", "article_summary": "Though Christie extolled the benefits of vaccination, he said there must be \u201csome measure of choice\u201d in the matter.\nCulture, Science & Faith Politicizing VaccinationRepublicans hate women, children, puppies, rainbows and especially Science\u2122.\nThe California counties surrounding San Francisco (which went for Obama by 84% in 2012) also have especially low vaccination rates.\n\u2026 The science is right now inconclusive, but we have to research it.\u201d Perhaps he settled the science during his first term.\nWealthy schools in Los Angeles now feature vaccination rates as low as South Sudan."}
