The increasingly frail elder statesman was hospitalized in early February with severe pneumonia.\n\nState television broke away from its regular programming with a rolling hagiographic tribute to Lee\u2019s life and achievements. In a live broadcast, one of its reporters called the death the \u201cawful and dreaded\u201d news. Effusive tributes flowed in from world leaders, including President Barack Obama, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nA self-proclaimed authoritarian who saw the world in stark realist terms, Lee commanded respect from Singaporeans, who this year will celebrate the country\u2019s 50th anniversary of independence. He led multiracial Singapore with an iron grip for more than three decades until 1990, and is credited with transforming the resource-poor island into a wealthy finance and trade entrepot with low crime and little corruption.\n\nSingapore\u2019s government has declared seven days of national mourning, and flags will fly at half-staff on state buildings. A national holiday has not been declared, as daily life in this pragmatically commercial city of vaulting glass towers and broad, immaculate streets continues to bustle.\n\nStill, there were tears and a deep sense of loss among Singaporeans who lionize Lee for his role in creating an oasis of stability in a region saddled with corruption, political violence and poverty. Many feel he provided them with a roof over their heads by creating a system of state-subsidized housing where the majority of Singaporeans live.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s my idol,\u201d said 55-year-old homemaker Lua Su Yean, standing near the sprawling display of flowers and cards left by Singaporeans at the hospital where Lee spent the last weeks of his life.\n\nShe said her \u201cheart dropped\u201d on hearing the news and got her husband to drive her to the hospital.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s done such great things and there\u2019s nothing bad I can say about him,\u201d she said. \u201cMy children grew up listening to my stories about him, and my grandchildren as well.\u201d\n\nLee\u2019s son, current Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, struggled to hold back tears in a televised address.\n\nSpeaking in Malay, Mandarin and English, the prime minister said Lee built a nation and gave Singaporeans a proud identity.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t see another man like him. To many Singaporeans, and indeed others too, Lee Kuan Yew was Singapore,\u201d he said.\n\nUnder Lee and his successors, Singapore was known around the world for its strict social order, including a ban on chewing gum, restrictions on free speech, a practice of bankrupting political opponents with defamation lawsuits, and canings for crimes some countries would rule as minor. In recent years, it has become socially more liberal and the fragmented political opposition made gains in Singapore\u2019s last elections in 2011.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Singaporeans mourn death of founding father Lee Kuan Yew", "author": "Stephen Wright and Jeanette Tan", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Singaporeans mourn death of founding father Lee Kuan Yew", "title": "Singaporeans mourn death of founding father Lee Kuan Yew", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/23/singaporeans_mourn_death_of_founding_father_lee_kuan_yew_2/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/singapore-lee-kuan-yew-reaction.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Singaporeans mourn death of founding father Lee Kuan Yew", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/singapore-lee-kuan-yew-reaction.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Singaporeans mourn death of founding father Lee Kuan Yew", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Singaporeans mourn death of founding father Lee Kuan Yew", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd018c\"", "article_summary": "To many Singaporeans, and indeed others too, Lee Kuan Yew was Singapore,\u201d he said.\nSpeaking in Malay, Mandarin and English, the prime minister said Lee built a nation and gave Singaporeans a proud identity.\nEffusive tributes flowed in from world leaders, including President Barack Obama, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\u201cMy children grew up listening to my stories about him, and my grandchildren as well.\u201dLee\u2019s son, current Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, struggled to hold back tears in a televised address.\nThe government announced that Lee, 91, \u201cpassed away peacefully\u201d several hours before dawn at Singapore General Hospital."}
