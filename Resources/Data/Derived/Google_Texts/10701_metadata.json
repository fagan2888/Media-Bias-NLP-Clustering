Majority leaders become majority leaders because they develop a network of support within the caucus through judicious use of both money and influence to build their power. McCarthy was a perfect example of that and ascended to his throne fairly effortlessly when Eric Cantor was ignominiously unseated by an unknown primary opponent. He\u2019s a very savvy pol.\n\nSo it\u2019s not surprising that over the weekend the entire village began to kvell in unison at the news that McCarthy was lecturing Republicans about the need to \u201cgovern\u201d lest they be locked out of the presidency again in 2016. If there is one thing the political establishment loves more than anything it\u2019s a party leader scolding his own party, especially when they perceive it to be a call for a more genteel, centrist approach that doesn\u2019t challenge the status quo in any measurable way.\n\nNow in this case, there might be good reason to hope that Kevin McCarthy was putting some of his extremist colleagues on notice that their more outlandish shenanigans were not going to be tolerated any longer. No more government shutdowns, no more indiscriminate budget slashing, no more ludicrous investigations into Benghazi! or the IRS. Now is the time for the Republicans to show they are indeed the grown-ups in the room and start working across the aisle with Democrats to get things done for the good of the nation. Unfortunately, McCarthy doesn\u2019t live in Republican Bizarro world and neither do we so the chances of that happening are about as good as the chance that Jerry Brown is going down to defeat next week. No, McCarthy is doing something a little bit different and if you parse his words carefully you\u2019ll see what it is.\n\nJake Sherman at Politico broke this story on Monday with this opening line:\n\nHAUPPAUGE, N.Y. \u2014 House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy landed here from Los Angeles with a bang: He bluntly warned that Republicans will blow the presidency in 2016 if they don\u2019t make some radical changes \u2014 and quick. McCarthy, speaking without a working microphone, told a group of Long Island donors that Republicans\u2019 gains in the House will amount to little if they can\u2019t govern over the next two years.\n\nHe goes on to lay out an agenda that is short on precipitous \u201ccliffs\u201d and long on \u201cbig picture\u201d legislating. He claims they will introduce energy and infrastructure projects and business-focused tax programs. He expects to try to get more highway spending funded by more drilling. And he wants to set up \u201ca congressional mechanism\u201d that will completely overhaul the federal bureaucracy so that it works better. Why, if one didn\u2019t know better, one might assume this fellow thinks he won the presidency instead of the office of House majority leader.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Read between the lines of the new House majority leader's comments -- and a cynical strategy is clear as day", "author": "Heather Digby Parton", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Read between the lines of the new House majority leader's comments -- and a cynical strategy is clear as day", "title": "GOP leader\u2019s sneaky \u201916 plan: How Kevin McCarthy hopes to win back the White House", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/29/gop_leaders_sneaky_16_plan_how_kevin_mccarthy_hopes_to_win_back_the_white_house/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/kevin_mccarthy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Read between the lines of the new House majority leader's comments -- and a cynical strategy is clear as day", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/kevin_mccarthy.jpg", "title": "GOP leader\u2019s sneaky \u201916 plan: How Kevin McCarthy hopes to win back the White House", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "GOP leader\u2019s sneaky \u201916 plan: How Kevin McCarthy hopes to win back the White House", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, Congress, Editor's Picks, GOP, House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy, The Right, White House", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Why, if one didn\u2019t know better, one might assume this fellow thinks he won the presidency instead of the office of House majority leader.\nMajority leaders become majority leaders because they develop a network of support within the caucus through judicious use of both money and influence to build their power.\nTopics: 2016 Elections, Congress, Editor's Picks, GOP, House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy, The Right, White House, Politics NewsI wrote a little piece a while back about the great California hope, the new House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, in which I pointed out that his alleged moderation was as exaggerated as the idea that he was chosen for his ideology.\nNo, McCarthy is doing something a little bit different and if you parse his words carefully you\u2019ll see what it is.\nNow in this case, there might be good reason to hope that Kevin McCarthy was putting some of his extremist colleagues on notice that their more outlandish shenanigans were not going to be tolerated any longer."}
