Their findings show that mobile health app developers still have a lot to learn about their target users\u2019 needs.\n\nThe most damning insight comes from the question of why they stopped using the apps they downloaded. Nearly half, or 44 percent, said it took too much time to enter data. Another 40 percent said loss of interest was a factor and 36 percent pointed to hidden costs (shame on you!). More than one-third said the apps were confusing to use and 30 percent said they did not like that the apps shared their data with friends.\n\nIntuitive, user-centric design is something that some digital health companies pride themselves on, but not nearly enough execute.\n\n\u201cThe field of mobile health apps is still in a nascent stage and is characterized by a number of limitations, both in terms of sophistication of the apps themselves as well as in knowledge of consumer profiles,\u201d the report read. \u201cMost health apps have not been designed with input from health care and behavior change professionals.\u201d\n\nAmong some of the other findings:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The most damning insight comes from the question of why they stopped using the apps they downloaded.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "The most damning insight comes from the question of why they stopped using the apps they downloaded.", "title": "Health app developers: This is what\u2019s turning your users off", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/rejected_flickr_lucasmoratelli.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-30T13:39:00-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/11/health-app-developers-this-is-whats-turning-your-users-off/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/rejected_flickr_lucasmoratelli.jpg", "description": "The most damning insight comes from the question of why they stopped using the apps they downloaded.", "card": "summary", "title": "Health app developers: This is what's turning your users off - MedCity News"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,consumer wellness, digital health, Mobile Health, New York, New York City, New York University, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Daily", "tag": "New York University", "published_time": "2015-11-05T20:19:52-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-30T13:39:00-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Their findings show that mobile health app developers still have a lot to learn about their target users\u2019 needs.\n\u201cMost health apps have not been designed with input from health care and behavior change professionals.\u201dAmong some of the other findings:\nA survey by researchers at New York University School of Medicine\u2019s Population Health department of more than 1,600 smartphone users, mainly around Los Angeles and New York City, assessed their experience downloading health apps.\n\u201cThe field of mobile health apps is still in a nascent stage and is characterized by a number of limitations, both in terms of sophistication of the apps themselves as well as in knowledge of consumer profiles,\u201d the report read.\nIntuitive, user-centric design is something that some digital health companies pride themselves on, but not nearly enough execute."}
