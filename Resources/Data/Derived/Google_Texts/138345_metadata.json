But the weight loss also resulted in the loss of his ho-ho-ho spirit.\n\nOn this week\u2019s Saturday Night Live, actor Paul Rudd played the new and \u2018improved\u2019 Jolly Old St. Nick. After spending time at a spa and dropping 150 pounds \u2014 the \u2018Let\u2019s Move\u2018 initiative really worked for him \u2014 Santa returned to the North Pole to get the elves geared up for the upcoming holiday. But the little toymakers didn\u2019t quite understand the changes in Mr. Claus and asked about what happened.\n\n\u201cYou know what, I knew I needed to make better choices, and it paid off,\u201d Santa told the elves. \u201cAnd then my friend Michelle got me exercising, and viola! I\u2019m talking about my good friend Michelle Obama.\u201d\n\nMr. Claus then turned around to show off his new derri\u00e8re.\n\n\u201cHey, check out these glutes, huh?\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cYou could crack a tooth on this bumper!\u201d\n\nThe elves didn\u2019t like Santa\u2019s new look and behavior. But it didn\u2019t stop there. Mrs. Claus was also given the boot, in favor of a Chili\u2019s bartender named Candice. And the only toys the elves will be allowed to make are the Easy-Bake Juicer and Pilates Barbie.\n\nPlus, one of the leanest meats is reindeer.\n\nLooks like children around the world won\u2019t have much to be merry and bright about this Christmas. And they can thank the First Lady for that.\n\nWatch the clip below:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Santa Claus slimmed down this year, in response to health advice from his good friend, First Lady Michelle Obama.
