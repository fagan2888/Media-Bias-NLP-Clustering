Appearing on “The Kelly File” Friday night, TheBlaze TV’s Buck Sexton battled Democratic strategist Christopher Hahn over President Barack Obama’s “year in review.” The two butted heads as the Fox News panel discussed the Obama administration’s various missteps in 2013.

“Well, look, there’s a difference between accentuating the good and just making it up as you go along,” Sexton said, referring to White House’s flattering year in review. “This administration can’t set up a website but they certainly can write fiction, and that’s what they did here.”

“I think quite honestly, Pravda would be proud of the representation of the past year the Obama administration made here,” he added.

“Oh my God!” Hahn interrupted.

Sexton went on to call Obamacare a “disaster” for the American people that will only “get worse” in the future.

Hahn argued that the Obamacare “launch” was a failure, but the law itself is not a disaster.

“It’s not the launch, it’s the law. The law is the failure,” Sexton interjected.

When confronted with Obama’s horrendous poll numbers, Hahn argued that the rising stock market is increasing Americans’ optimism which will benefit Obama. That was about all he could muster when asked how Obama could turn things around going into 2014.

Later in the segment, Sexton blasted Obama for acting like an “outsider” in Washington, D.C., despite the fact that he is the president of United States.

The panel began the segment by discussing Phil Robertson and the so-called “Duck Dynasty” controversy. Watch “The Kelly File” segment via Fox News below:
