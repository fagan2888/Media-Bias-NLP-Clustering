He says he moved into the neighborhood a little over a year ago, and never heard or saw anything troubling coming from the home.\n\n\"I guess the boyfriend came over once and introduced himself, and said if I ever needed my lawn mowed to come see him and he'd do that,\" said Charin. \"That was really the extent of the conversation. Never really had anything to do with them.\"\n\nThe attack happened in the 2900 block of Lakeside Drive between Sunrise Blvd. and Northland Rd. Police responded after getting a 911 call from a woman, who lived inside of the home.\n\n\"When officers arrived they found 2 victims inside the residence. Two female victims,\" said The Village Deputy Chief Steve Jagosh,\n\nPolice say there was also a child inside of the home, but the little girl was not hurt. Both women were taken to the hospital, but the female friend was pronounced dead at the hospital.\n\n\"We have a possible suspect that we are trying to verify,\" said Jagosh. \"At this point the suspect did leave the scene in one of the victim's vehicles. We are trying to verify who he is at this point.\"\n\nPolice say the suspect took off in a grey Mazda van. Police believe he may have already left the area.\n\nIf you have any information you're asked to call The Village Police Department.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "The Village Police Department said one woman is dead and another injured after an assault in The Village Friday.", "author": "Adrianna Iwasinski", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/25770320/one-woman-dead-another-injured-after-an-assault-in-the-village", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/25770320_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Village Police Department said one woman is dead and another injured after an assault in The Village Friday.", "title": "One Woman Dead, Another Injured After Early Morning Attack In The Village"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/25770320_SA.jpg", "description": "The Village Police Department said one woman is dead and another injured after an assault in The Village Friday.", "card": "summary", "title": "One Woman Dead, Another Injured After Early Morning Attack In The Village"}, "wnreadableurl": "one-woman-dead-another-injured-after-an-assault-in-the-village", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2014/06/13", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media, crime, woman, dead, injured, assault, the village, news 9, news9.com, kwtv", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS25", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media, crime, woman, dead, injured, assault, the village, news 9, news9.com, kwtv"}, "article_summary": "\"When officers arrived they found 2 victims inside the residence.\nPolice responded after getting a 911 call from a woman, who lived inside of the home.\nPolice responded to a home near Hefner and May Ave. shortly after 7:00 a.m.One woman is dead and another is recovering in the hospital after they were both attacked early Friday morning.\nPolice say the suspect took off in a grey Mazda van.\nSome people living on Lakeside Drive say their neighborhood is pretty quiet for the most part."}
