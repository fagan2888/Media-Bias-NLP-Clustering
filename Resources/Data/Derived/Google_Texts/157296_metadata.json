Michel Euler/AP\n\nThe historic Paris climate agreement is concluded. Every country in the world is now in the climate fight, to one degree or another. In its wake are three obvious and important markers for those who\u2019ve paid attention:\n\nFirst, President Obama\u2019s legacy is likely secure \u2013 his suite of executive actions on climate change round out a trio of significant achievements with the U.S.-Iran nuclear deal and the Affordable Care Act as benchmarks for historians.\n\nSecond, 20 years of frustration in international climate negotiations are now in the dustbin of history. The Paris agreement erased all of that in a fortnight.\n\nAnd, third, whatever remained of the contrived, artificial climate science \u201cdebate\u201d in the media is gone for good. Now, the focus for global media is on immediate and impending climate impacts \u2013 such as the reason why millions are fleeing the desertification around the Sahel region in Africa.\n\nSo now what?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see a fundamental shift in the underlying energy mix,\u201d Bank of America investment strategist Sarbjit Nahal told Bloomberg TV.\n\nEntire industries will now respond to the clear signal sent by the Paris climate agreement \u2013 partially because extreme weather connected to climate now touches 10 percent of the planet (compared to less than 1 percent two decades ago) and is costing economies trillions of dollars; and partially because it will spur even greater new investments in renewable energy development, which has already reached a tipping point in the range of $300 billion or more, Nahal said.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest companies most directly affected by the Paris accord (oil companies like ExxonMobil, BP, Shell and Chevron) have already begun to shift in anticipation, and will likely accelerate moves toward natural gas and away from coal and oil. This is almost certainly their exit strategy.\n\n[READ: Nations Sign Historic Climate Change Agreement]\n\nIf a global price on carbon emerges in the next few years to augment the national emission targets enshrined in the Paris climate agreement, oil majors looking over the horizon may very well position themselves to move into new lines of business that reward investments in lower-carbon forms of energy.\n\nExxonMobil - the world\u2019s largest energy company known for its support of climate policies championed by Republican Party leaders in Washington, D.C. - was first out of the gate.\n\n\u201cExxonMobil takes global climate change seriously and the risks of rising greenhouse gas emissions warrant thoughtful action,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThe long-term objective of climate change policy should be to reduce the risks of serious harm to humanity and ecosystems at minimum societal cost.\u201d\n\nExxonMobil also reiterated \u2013 as it has before, but more publicly now with analysts and media - that it believes a price on carbon is the best long-term solution in the marketplace.\n\n\u201cClimate change is a global issue and it requires global solutions,\u201d it said. \u201cExxonMobil has for many years held the view that a revenue-neutral carbon tax is the best option to fulfill these key principles. Instead of subsidies and mandates that distort markets, stifle innovation, and needlessly raise energy costs, a carbon tax could help create the conditions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a way that spurs new efficiencies and technologies.\u201d\n\nThe Paris accord has also sent a significant signal to investors in every corner of the world.\n\n\u201cPerhaps the most significant effect of the Paris agreement in the next few years will be the signal it sends to investors: the united governments of the world say that the age of fossil fuels has started drawing to a close,\u201d the Economist concluded. \u201cAfter Paris, the belief that governments are going to stay the course on their stated green strategies will feel a bit better founded\u2014and the idea of investing in a coal mine will seem more risky.\u201d\n\n[MORE: Businesses Back Paris Climate Change Agreement]\n\nOther financial analysts echo this sentiment. Barclays Bank told its clients that the Paris accord will weaken the long-term fundamentals of fossil fuel industries, while boosting capital goods and low-carbon power-generation sectors. Merrill Lynch said coal is now a \u201cstranded asset.\u201d Goldman Sachs noted that the four biggest U.S. coal companies lost 90 percent of market capitalization in 2015.\n\nGlobal financial leaders said on the heels of the Paris accord that they are ready to invest significant resources in lower-carbon energy sources.\n\n\u201cThe Paris outcome (is) an historic milestone on the road to a more sustainable economy,\u201d said Stuart Gulliver, the group chief executive of banking giant HSBC. \u201cThe scale of the transformation demands the rapid mobilization of private finance. As a leading international bank, HSBC has a crucial role to play in the transition to a low-carbon economy.
