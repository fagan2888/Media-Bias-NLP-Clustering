He recently won the Oscar for his role in Dallas Buyers Club and also stars in the critically acclaimed HBO show, True Detective. And on Saturday Night Live this week, cast member Taran Killam paid tribute to the Hollywood star in a spot-on impression during Weekend Update.\n\nKillam\u2019s McConaughey, in true McConaughey style, drawled his way through the interview with host Colin Jost, using ridiculous phrases \u2014 \u201cHola, kemosabe\u201d \u2014 and his all-too-familiar hand gestures.\n\nThe real actor received some flak for his odd best actor acceptance speech at the Oscars, during which he named the future version of himself as his hero and tried to explain that he constantly kept pursuing that person. And on SNL, as Jost tried to congratulate the hippy, dippy, fake McConaughey on his win, it became apparent that the weird, wacky double-talk wasn\u2019t limited to an award speech.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t congratulate me,\u201d fake McConaughey responded. \u201cCongratulate the man I was a week ago. Congratulate the man I\u2019m chasing. Congratulate, Colin, the man who never existed.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd who is that?\u201d Jost asked.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d Killam\u2019s McConaughey said.\n\nThe sketch was filled with classic McConaughey-isms that no one really understands, and Jost struggled to keep it together as Killam went all out in his impression, babbling and waving his hands around. When asked by Jost what his answers meant, McConaughey responded, \u201cIt means, Colin, that I don\u2019t remember the question.\u201d\n\nAnd thus, the mystery of the actor\u2019s strange sayings and phrases is revealed: He has no idea what he\u2019s talking about half the time either!\n\nWatch the sketch here:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Who doesn't love Matthew McConaughey?
