Open enrollment for Obamacare began November 15th and will run until February 15th, 2015. This year will have fewer challenges than last year, but evaluating the options is still a hurdle for many. All health insurance plans offered through HealthCare.Gov are required to offer a minimum standard of coverage. Choosing which plan to purchase depends largely on how much you will spend on health care throughout the year. Whether you're new to the health care exchange or renewing your coverage from 2014, make sure you choose the right plan for your needs.
