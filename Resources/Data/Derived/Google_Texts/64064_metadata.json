Thomas arranged and attended her funeral Sunday in Georgia. She helped raise Demaryius as a young child before he moved in with his aunt.\n\n\u201cIt was tough. We knew it was coming soon, but we didn\u2019t know how soon,\u201d Thomas said after Monday night\u2019s walkthrough at Dove Valley. \u201cI went home after the Super Bowl and she was fine. She was talking. And then she was gone. But I know she\u2019s in a better place. It was good to get back out here and do something I love.\u201d\n\nThomas looked weary, understandable given the emotions of the past week. He thanked the Broncos for their compassion.\n\n\u201cI want to take my hat off to them. They sent flowers,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIt was wonderful that they let me go. They were looking out for me and my family.\u201d\n\nIt should not take long to catch up, Thomas explained. He watched video of the practices he missed, and has a strong grasp of the Broncos offense.\n\n\u201cI am not behind,\u201d said Thomas, who must participate in two more workouts before practicing in pads, per the collective bargaining agreement. \u201cIt was good to be back. All the guys were keeping me smiling.\u201d\n\nHarris passes exam. Von Miller predicted Chris Harris would ace his knee exam with Dr. James Andrews on Monday based on the cornerback\u2019s workouts. He was correct as Andrews gave Harris a clean bill of health following the 30 percent tear of his left ACL nearly six months ago.\n\n\u201cIt passed,\u201d Harris said. \u201cEverything\u2019s good. I can feel like a teammate now.\u201d\n\nHarris said he\u2019s not sure when the Broncos will clear him to practice, but he hopes to put on the pads and helmet and start participating in individual and position drills this week. It\u2019s unlikely Harris would play in a preseason game, but he vows to be ready by the regular-season opener Sept. 7 against the Indianapolis Colts at Sports Authority Field at Mile High.\n\nWare watches. DeMarcus Ware sat out Monday\u2019s morning practice, wearing a protective sleeve on his bruised right lower leg.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Ware said.\n\nWare hurt his leg Sunday and was removed as a precaution halfway through the workout.\n\nOther injured players not participating included defensive end Greg Latta (knee), tight end Jameson Konz (knee sprain) and John Boyett (back).\n\nMusic man. Peyton Manning became a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d skit on Monday, dancing to one of his favorite songs. As the deejay du jour, Manning chose \u201cRocky Top\u201d as the the Broncos\u2019 opening stretch music.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I am talking about,\u201d Manning said as the tune ended. \u201cBest practice of the year.\u201d\n\nFellow Tennessee Volunteers Malik Jackson and Britton Colquitt approved.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody else enjoyed it but us Tennessee guys. But you can\u2019t deny a good song like that,\u201d Colquitt said.\n\nOff day. The Broncos are off Tuesday, with players free to vacate the nearby hotel.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a true day off. I am going to wake up around 10:30 a.m., get the mind right, do errands and pay bills,\u201d Jackson said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Demaryius Thomas makes his return to camp", "title": "Demaryius Thomas makes his return to camp", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/28/demaryius-thomas-makes-his-return-to-camp/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140728__Demaryius-Thomasp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140728__Demaryius-Thomasp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-28T20:47:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:17:45+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Hours after burying his grandmother, Demaryius Thomas found solace in practice, rejoining his teammates after a difficult four-day absence.\nWe knew it was coming soon, but we didn\u2019t know how soon,\u201d Thomas said after Monday night\u2019s walkthrough at Dove Valley.\n\u201cI am not behind,\u201d said Thomas, who must participate in two more workouts before practicing in pads, per the collective bargaining agreement.\nThey were looking out for me and my family.\u201dIt should not take long to catch up, Thomas explained.\nVon Miller predicted Chris Harris would ace his knee exam with Dr. James Andrews on Monday based on the cornerback\u2019s workouts."}
