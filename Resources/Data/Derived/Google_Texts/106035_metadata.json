Several inches of rain, falling on already-saturated ground and swollen waterways, led to mandatory evacuations in the Globe Meadows trailer park in north Sterling Saturday night, and pre-evacuation calls to residents in rural Logan County north and northwest of Sterling.\n\nThe Sterling Police Department and Sterling Fire Department deployed their large 6x6 rescue vehicles to assist with evacuations and made several rescues.\n\nBy Sunday morning, the flooded areas inside city limits had dried enough that residents were returning to their homes, and the evacuation orders all expired on Monday. However, a number of roads remained closed due to water and flood damage as of Monday evening, including some that were damaged in earlier flooding from two weeks ago, according to the Northeast Colorado Public Affairs Collaborative:\n\n\u2022 County Road 18 between C.R. 9 and 11\n\n\u2022 C.R. 16 between C.R. 5 and 3\n\n\u2022 C.R. 22 between C.R. 1 and 3\n\n\u2022 C.R. 40 between C.R. 27 and 29\n\n\u2022 C.R. 29 between Colo. 14 and C.R. 32\n\n\u2022 C.R. 27 between Colo. 14 and C.R. 26\n\n\u2022 C.R. 34 between C.R. 29 and 31\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 C.R. 41 between C.R. 44 and 40\n\n\u2022 C.R. 46 between C.R. 37 and 33\n\nA number of emergency response agencies were called out at around 10 p.m. Sunday night after a vehicle was driven around barricades on C.R. 93 near Crook and became high centered on a washed out portion of road. The Crook Fire Protection District, Logan County Sheriff's Office, Colorado State Patrol, Logan County Office of Emergency Management, Logan County Search and Rescue's Dive Team and the Sterling Fire Department responded and performed a swift water rescue. \"Emergency officials are urging residents to not travel across flooded roads or cross any posted barriers,\" NPAC's update stated.\n\nWhile the weather improved somewhat Monday \u2014 enough to allow the Logan County Office of Emergency Management to continue with virtual operations \u2014 NPAC warned that water levels in the South Platte River and area creeks and ditches remain high \"and the biggest threat right now is additional rainfall and runoff.\" With chances of showers and thunderstorms in the forecast daily through the week, combined with snowmelt coming to the river over the next few weeks, officials urge residents to continue to be alert to changing conditions and possible future flood danger.\n\nThose seeking more information can call the NPAC public information line, 970-466-2871, or visit the NPAC Facebook page.\n\nSara Waite: 970-526-9310, swaite@journal-advocate.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url":
