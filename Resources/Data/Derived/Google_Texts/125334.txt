CHICAGO (AP) — Devin Booker had 19 points, and No. 1 Kentucky scored the game’s first 24 points in an 83-44 victory over UCLA on Saturday.

Aaron Harrison added 15 points, and the Wildcats (12-0) handed the Bruins (8-4) one of their most-lopsided losses ever.

The first meeting between the storied programs in eight years turned ugly as soon as the game started, with Kentucky dominating UCLA in every possible way.

The 24-0 run at the start of the game was eight shy of the record between two Division I teams, set by Connecticut against New Hampshire on Dec. 12, 1990. And the 39-point margin was nine shy of the Bruins’ record.

The Wildcats led 41-7 at the intermission, the lowest point total in a half for UCLA and the fewest by a Kentucky opponent since December 1943.
