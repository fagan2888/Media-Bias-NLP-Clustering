Martin Dempsey said before a Senate committee, \u201cI will personally attest to the fact that [the world is] more dangerous than it has ever been.\u201d While there\u2019s good reason to doubt that this claim is accurate, as Steven Pinker masterfully details in his \u201cThe Better Angels of Our Nature,\u201d the fact is that there are many dark forces lingering in the world today, and modern technologies \u2014 from Twitter and YouTube to nuclear bombs and bioweapons \u2014are empowering malicious actors like never before.\n\nWhen I ponder the greatest threats to the United States, the first thing that comes to mind is Islamic terrorism. No doubt this is the case for most Americans. Since the early 1990s, religious terrorism, most notably driven by Muslim fanatics overseas, has emerged as a major source of violence. According to the Global Terrorism Index, religious terrorism is now the \u201cmain driver\u201d of terrorism in the world. This is disconcerting because religiously motivated acts of violence tend to be both more lethal and indiscriminate than past forms of terrorism perpetrated by nationalists, anarchists and Marxists. In this sense, Dempsey is absolutely correct that our situation is more dangerous, even if statistics suggest an overall decline in violence.\n\nThis being said, when I consider the greatest threats to human civilization, it\u2019s the United States that stands out above other potential risks. And I\u2019m not the only one: According to a 2014 global survey, the world as a whole voted the United States to be the No. 1 threat to world peace \u201cby a large margin.\u201d Even some of our closest allies identified America as the most significant menace. This is an astonishing result that suggests that a reinterpretation of American exceptionalism may be in order: Perhaps we are exceptional after all, but not in the ways we\u2019d like to think. The world is scared of us.\n\nBut why? Why does the world fear the United States more than countries like North Korea and Iran? The answer is that, as critics of the U.S. are quick to point out, many of the most significant conflicts of our age have been nontrivially caused, or exacerbated, by our own foolish actions. To justify this claim, we could go back decades to single out foreign policy blunders like overthrowing a democratic government in Iran in 1953, supporting Saddam during his worst WMD atrocities, and shooting down Iran Air flight 655 while it was in Iranian airspace \u2014 and then refusing to apologize.\n\nBut let\u2019s start more recently with the 2003 U.S.-led preemptive invasion of Iraq, which resulted in at least 30,000 civilians deaths in the first two years, according to George W. Bush himself, because of an attack on the U.S. that killed slightly under 3,000 people. It\u2019s virtually indisputable that this war seriously worsened the growing problem of Islamic terrorism by destabilizing the Middle East and convincing a whole generation of moderate Muslims to pick up a Kalashnikov and join the holy fight against the \u201cCrusaders.\u201d As the former deputy director of the CIA Michael Morell observes in his book \u201cThe Great War of Our Time,\u201d the Iraq conflict only confirmed the very message that Osama bin Laden was pushing. In Morell\u2019s words, \u201cthere is also no doubt that the Iraq War supported the al Qa\u2019ida narrative and helped spread the group\u2019s ideology.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the Iraq War convinced a whole generation of Muslims \u2014 both Sunni and Shi\u2019ite \u2014 that the end of the world is imminent, leading to a rise of apocalyptic fervor in the Middle East. As the Islamic scholar David Cook notes, it was \u201cwidely accepted\u201d that the U.S.-led war fulfilled certain Islamic prophecies, and in fact a leading Shia militia in Iraq whose explicit aim was to expel the foreign invaders named itself the Mahdi Army after Islam\u2019s end-of-days messianic figure, the Mahdi. A 2014 Reuters article even cites a Shi\u2019ite fighter as saying that he became convinced that the end was nigh after the U.S. and Britain invaded Iraq. \u201cThat was the first sign,\u201d he said, \u201cand then everything else followed.\u201d\n\nThe same cause-and-effect relationship between the Iraq debacle and the apocalyptic zeitgeist of the region can be found among the Sunnis. The early progenitor of the Islamic State, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, fomented apocalyptic anticipation by citing a grand battle \u2014 essentially Armageddon \u2014 prophesied to take place in the small Syrian town of Dabiq. In fact, each issue of the Islamic State\u2019s online propaganda magazine, noncoincidentally named Dabiq, opens with the following declaration from al-Zarqawi: \u201cThe spark has been lit here in Iraq, and its heat will continue to intensify\u2026 until it burns the crusader armies in Dabiq.\u201d\n\nAfter al-Zarqawi\u2019s death, the emphasis on eschatological activism was passed along to subsequent leaders, including Abu Ayyub al-Masri and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the current caliph of the Islamic State. As Graeme Wood notes in his 2015 article \u201cWhat ISIS Really Wants,\u201d \u201cDuring the last years of the U.S. occupation of Iraq, the Islamic State\u2019s immediate founding fathers \u2026 saw signs of the end times everywhere. They were anticipating, within a year, the arrival of the Mahdi.\u201d Today, the Islamic State still fantasizes aloud about the impending war in Dabiq, as well as numerous other prophesies that appear, in their eyes, to be coming true, such as 80 different nations teaming up to confront the Muslim forces. At present, the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS includes slightly more than 60 nations. So, do the math.\n\nThe unfortunate fact is that extremism breeds extremism, meaning that the de novo problem of terrorism created by the Iraq War is feeding-back to further strengthen and consolidate the political right\u2019s power and appeal to voters in the U.S. This has manifested itself in proposals like killing the family members of ISIS and \u201cbomb[ing] the sh*t out of them,\u201d as Donald Trump so eloquently put it. Even more alarming, Trump recently suggested that we should ban all Muslims from entering the United States \u2014 an idea that even Dick Cheney said \u201cgoes against everything we stand for and believe in.\u201d If such policies were to be enacted, they would, of course, only further empower the terrorists. As one of the leading experts on suicide terrorism, Robert Pape, observes, terrorist suicide attacks are largely a demand-driven rather than supply-limited phenomenon. Thus, unless we were to destroy the entire \u201chornet\u2019s nest\u201d with a flurry of nuclear weapons \u2014 an obviously immoral strategy (but see below!) \u2014 poking the \u201cnest\u201d would only agitate the \u201chornets\u201d even more. Eliminate the demand and you mitigate terrorism.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Even our closest allies fear that we are a menace militarily and environmentally.
