Spending for the federal exchange is harder to pin down because funding has come from multiple accounts, including: the $1 billion Health Insurance Implementation Fund; DHHS\u2019 General Departmental Management Account and General Departmental Management Account; CMS\u2019s Program Management Account and the Prevention and Public Health Fund. CMS estimates fiscal 2014 spending for the federally-operated exchanges at $2 billion. So it\u2019s safe to say that the costs of getting the exchanges up and running, and (hopefully) enrolling 7 million people in the program\u2019s first year will exceed $6 billion.\n\nBear in mind that the exchanges won\u2019t actually pay any medical bills, just sign people up for coverage. So billions more in overhead costs will show up on the books of the private insurers and state Medicaid programs that will actually process medical claims.\n\nBack in 1966, Medicare started paying bills for 18.9 million seniors (99 percent of those eligible for coverage) just 11 months after Pres. Johnson signed it into law. Overhead costs for the first year totaled $120 million (equivalent to $867 million in 2013 \u2013 all subsequent figures are given in 2013 dollars). But that figure includes the cost of processing medical bills, not just the enrollment costs.\n\nMoreover, Medicare and Medicaid (which was passed at the same time) displaced several smaller federal health assistance programs, saving about $376 million on their overhead costs.\n\nSigning up most of the elderly for Medicare was simple; they were already known to Social Security Administration, which handled enrollment. To find the rest, the feds sent out mailings to seniors, held local meetings, and asked postal workers, forest rangers and agricultural representatives to help contact people in remote areas. The Office for Economic Opportunity spent $14.5 million to hire 5,000 low income seniors who went door-to-door in their neighborhoods.\n\nDespite predictions of chaos, and worries that the newly-insured seniors would flood the health care system, there were few bottlenecks. Hospitals continued to operate smoothly and no waiting lists materialized. The only real \u201cglitch\u201d was that many hospitals in the Deep South initially refused to integrate their facilities \u2013 which Medicare required for certification and payment. But by the end of the first month, 99.5 percent of hospitals had signed on.\n\nObamacare\u2019s start-up has been rocky because complexity is \u201cbaked in\u201d to the design, just as simplicity was \u201cbaked in\u201d to Medicare. Obamacare\u2019s exchanges must coordinate thousands of different plans, with premiums, co-payments, deductibles and provider networks that vary county-by-county; Medicare offered a single, uniform plan. The exchanges must calculate subsidies for each applicant after first verifying income, family size and immigration status; Medicare offered free hospital coverage, with a minimal ($22) uniform premium for doctor coverage. Instead of setting up a new bureaucracy to collect premiums from millions of enrollees and funnel them to private insurers, Medicare relied on the existing payroll and income tax system to garner funds.\n\nObamacare\u2019s byzantine complexity reflects the contortions required to simultaneously expand coverage and appease private insurers. And private insurers will exact a steep ongoing toll. Medicare\u2019s overhead is just 2 percent, vs. an average of 13 percent for private plans (on top of the Exchanges\u2019 costs, roughly 3 percent of premiums). A single payer plan that excluded private insurers could save hundreds of billions in transaction costs.\n\nMedical quality improvement experts often advise hospitals to \u201cavoid workarounds\u201d; fix system defects rather than force doctors and nurses to sidestep problems like faulty equipment, understaffing, or illegible handwritings. This advice is equally valid for health reform. To avoid glitches and wasteful expense, design the system right; eliminate private insurers and cover everyone under a single payer program.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2014/01/02/medicares-rollout-vs-obamacares-glitches-brew/", "type": "article", "image": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/wp-content/themes/HealthAffairs2015/images/facebook-default.jpg", "site_name": "Health Affairs", "title": "Medicare\u2019s Rollout vs. Obamacare\u2019s Glitches Brew"}, "description": "Medicare\u2019s Rollout vs. Obamacare\u2019s Glitches Brew | At the intersection of health, health care, and policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfc12\"", "article_summary": "To avoid glitches and wasteful expense, design the system right; eliminate private insurers and cover everyone under a single payer program.\nA single payer plan that excluded private insurers could save hundreds of billions in transaction costs.\nObamacare\u2019s byzantine complexity reflects the contortions required to simultaneously expand coverage and appease private insurers.\nAnd private insurers will exact a steep ongoing toll.\nBack in 1966, Medicare started paying bills for 18.9 million seniors (99 percent of those eligible for coverage) just 11 months after Pres."}
