Thad Cochran gives the Republican Party\u2019s Weekly Remarks\n\nHello. I\u2019m Thad Cochran, United States Senator for Mississippi.\n\nThe beginning of the New Year is a time when many Americans decide to make positive changes in their lives. It can be a time we decide to adopt healthier lifestyles or take a fresh look at the family budget. (Scroll to bottom for video of these remarks.)\n\nUnfortunately, as this year begins many people are worried about how the so-called Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare, is affecting both their health and personal finances.\n\nRepublicans in the Senate think we should repeal or defund the program because of its cost and complexity.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was supposed to be fully operational by January 1 of this year. But, here we are two weeks into 2014, and the administration continues to struggle to implement the law\u2019s burdensome mandates.\n\nThe law is not living up to the promises made by its supporters, and it is questionable whether the law will meet its fundamental purpose \u2014 to significantly expand health insurance coverage. Five million Americans have been kicked out of the health plans that they liked and were promised they could keep.\n\nSome of my constituents have discovered that the new insurance can cost twice as much as they had been paying. Many others are being denied access to doctors with whom they were perfectly happy.\n\nThe administration\u2019s enrollment numbers don\u2019t paint a pretty picture. They don\u2019t tell us how many of the enrollees have actually lost existing coverage and were forced into the exchanges; and the numbers don\u2019t tell us whether applicants have actually paid their premiums and received coverage. There is ample reason to be skeptical that those numbers will improve substantially.\n\nIf the law can\u2019t keep its most basic promise, it should be repealed, and we\u2019ve introduced legislation to do just that.\n\nWe should go back to the drawing board and draft commonsense, bipartisan legislation that will work better for all Americans, without spending billions of taxpayer dollars to support these failing policies.\n\nIn the spirit of the New Year, we should resolve to help make our health care system more user-friendly and affordable. Thank you. ####\n\nRELATED:\n\nHow bad will 2014 be for Obama?\n\nObama keeps vowing to talk about jobs\n\nObama seeks more money to expand his grassroots army\n\nBiden is a \u2018leading statesman of his time,\u2019 says his former press guy", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
