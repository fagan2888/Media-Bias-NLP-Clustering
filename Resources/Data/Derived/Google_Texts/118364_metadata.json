Children can join or remain on a parent\u2019s plan even if they are married, no longer living with or are financially dependent on their parents, attending school, or are eligible for coverage through their job, according to HealthCare.gov.\n\nMichael Munoz, sales and marketing senior vice president for AmeriHealth answered more specific questions on how it works:\n\nQ: Are adult children entitled to dental and vision services?\n\nA: They are under their parents\u2019 plan if they are under the age of 19. After that time there is a rider available they would be able to purchase to have those services covered. You can buy free-standing dental or vision coverage, or you can go to a carrier that specializes in that. It depends on the coverage, but there are discounted plans starting anywhere from $8 to $12 a month up to $60-$70 a month.\n\nQ: If an adult child leaves her parents\u2019 plan because she gets coverage through her job, then gets laid off, can she go back on her parents\u2019 plan?\n\nA: As long as a child is under the age of 26, they can go back on their parents\u2019 plan. The child can also be eligible for COBRA from her employer, or can go to the federal exchange if they qualify for a subsidized plan, or if not, go directly to the carrier and buy an individual plan.\n\nQ: What happens to the child\u2019s coverage if a parent changes jobs and enrolls in COBRA?\n\nA: The child can qualify for the parent\u2019s COBRA plan.\n\nQ: How quickly does an adult child lose coverage after age 26?\n\nA: At the end of the month. If a child\u2019s birthday is March 15, then coverage ends March 31. If a child\u2019s birthday is March 31, that is the last day.\n\nQ: Prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, New Jersey already had a law that allowed parents to place their adult children on their plans. How do the state and federal laws compare?\n\nA: Prior to Obamacare in New Jersey, parents had the ability to cover their adult children up to age 31. Now after age 26, adult children can go on their parents\u2019 plan and get a lower price premium, under the state statute.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\u2022 Obamacare: Unraveling NJ FamilyCare and Medicaid\n\n\u2022 Complete Health and Fitness coverage", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@health','obamacare'", "title": "Obamacare perk: Coverage for kids on parent's plan til age 26", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Obamacare perk: Coverage for kids on parent\\u0027s plan til age 26\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/04/obamacare_perk_coverage_for_kids_on_parents_plan_til_age_26.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/04/14618782-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12572687\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-04-03T11:51:39Z\", \"author\": \"Susan K.
