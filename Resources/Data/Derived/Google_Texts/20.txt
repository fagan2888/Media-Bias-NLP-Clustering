A security guard was hospitalized Sunday morning after police say a naked man attacked her.

The incident happened around 6 a.m. at Southlake Village Apartments in the 4100 block of South Seneca. Police say the live-in security guard responded to a noise complaint when the 20-year-old naked man confronted her.

The man then attacked the guard, punching her to the ground and kicking her. Several residents heard the 61-year-old security guard screaming and went to her aid.

Officers arrived on scene and found the naked man acting "extremely irrational." He was apprehended and taken to the hospital for treatment of a possible LSD overdose.

The victim was also taken to an area hospital with a possible concussion.

Police say the man didn't live in the area. He could face battery charges.

The attack happened at the same apartment complex where 24-year-old Jared Woosypiti was killed, ending a 32-hour standoff with Wichita police in July of 2013.
