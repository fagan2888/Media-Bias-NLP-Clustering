Mike Chambers summarizes Yandle as a player in our advance box this morning:\n\nSpotlight on Keith Yandle: The defenseman leads the Coyotes in scoring but has a team-worst minus-27 rating, which is tied for 817th among 822 NHL players. Yandle has produced a league-high 26 power-play points (which do not factor in on plus-minus) and is tied for fourth among the league\u2019s defensemen in overall points (40). His upside outweighs his downside, given that he averages 24 minutes per game. That ranks 20th among NHL blue- liners and second for the Coyotes.\n\nMentioning Yandle here in conjunction with that Sakic-Maloney chat is not a claim to know anything or to have picked up some chatter with a parabolic microphone, but it makes sense that as the Avalanche checks around in exploring if it can acquire a quality defenseman, Yandle would be a possibility.\n\nHowever, a playoff-bound team thinking more short-term might be more prone to offer the Coyotes a compelling package, and one of the Avalanche\u2019s problems is a dearth of prospects in its pipeline to include as part of any deal.\n\n\u2014 I almost felt self-conscious the other day asking who would start in the Colorado net. The answer was, of course, Semyon Varlamov.\n\nHere\u2019s another way the Avalanche has painted itself into a corner with Reto Berra as the backup, and with its obvious lack of faith in him.\n\nIf Colorado plays him now, it would be widely viewed as tossing in the towel.\n\nAs I touched on in my Monday column, I personally believe trying to determine if Berra is indeed a disaster, or if given another chance, he could fool us, is worth it at this point and preferable to playing Varlamov into the ground \u2014 yes even before the Avalanche\u2019s playoff hopes completely disappear.\n\nEven if the upside is that the Avalanche somehow gets back in that playoff hunt \u2014 bear with me for the sake of illustration \u2014 Varlamov can\u2019t play every game in a shocking closing run, and the other option would be to recall Calvin Pickard for the stretch run.\n\nSo if the answer soon to the \u201cAnd in net\u2026?\u201d question is Berra, I won\u2019t rip it. The Avalanche at this point needs to get some answers.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Arizona Coyotes,Colorado Avalanche,Don Maloney,Joe Sakic,Keith Yandle,Reto Berra", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Avalanche", "description": "GMs Joe Sakic of the Avalanche and Don Maloney of the Coyotes chatted at the morning skate", "title": "GMs Joe Sakic of Avalanche, Don Maloney of Coyotes chatted", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2015/02/16/avalanche-vs-coyotes-pre-game-musings/20830/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2015/02/SakicMaloney.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "GMs Joe Sakic of the Avalanche and Don Maloney of the Coyotes chatted at the morning skate", "creator": "@TFrei", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2015/02/16/avalanche-vs-coyotes-pre-game-musings/20830/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2015/02/SakicMaloney.jpg", "title": "Avalanche vs. Coyotes pre-game musings", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "GMs Joe Sakic of the Avalanche and Don Maloney of the Coyotes chatted at the morning skate"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddf98\"", "article_summary": "Here\u2019s another way the Avalanche has painted itself into a corner with Reto Berra as the backup, and with its obvious lack of faith in him.\nThat ranks 20th among NHL blue- liners and second for the Coyotes.\nA couple of pre-game thoughts:\u2014 OK, so neither the zoom-in on my iPhone nor the operator was capable of producing a sharp picture here.\nSo if the answer soon to the \u201cAnd in net\u2026?\u201d question is Berra, I won\u2019t rip it.\nThe Avalanche at this point needs to get some answers."}
