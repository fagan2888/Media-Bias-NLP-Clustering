Police say both drunk driving and texting caused a man to crash into an unoccupied patrol car early Saturday morning.

Officers were investigating a fight on the side of the road just before 2 a.m., and were out of their cruisers talking to the couple involved in the fight when the group heard a loud crash.

Police say the driver ran into the back of one cruiser, which was then shoved into the cruiser parked in front of it. The two police cars and the suspect's vehicle all ended up with moderate-to-severe damage. No one was injured.

Jason Pope, 32, faces charges of careless driving, DUI and driving while texting.

The crash happened on the 3200 block of Hancock Expressway in Colorado Springs.
