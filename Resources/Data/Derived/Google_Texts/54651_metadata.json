That's the year the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development issued national standards for mobile home construction.\n\n\"It comes down to a question of fairness,\" said City Attorney Tom Carr. \"If people bought their homes with an expectation of being able to sell them, and people have recently sold pre-1976 homes, it seems a little unfair to tell them they cannot.\n\n\"Most people's savings are tied up in their homes,\" he added. \"These are folks at an economic level where they may not have a lot of savings. If you take away $50,000 they thought they had, that might be all their savings. If it's safe, it seems fair to let them sell.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs recently as last year, pre-1976 homes were bought and sold and allowed to stay within Vista Village, but several home owners who approached the park management about selling their homes this year were told they would have to be removed at the time of sale.\n\nWhile the mobile home owner owns the structure, the park owns and leases the land and has to agree to lease to the new owner.\n\nMiller has said requiring the removal of older homes is not a new policy, despite the testimony of many residents, including some who bought pre-1976 homes last year.\n\nSome consider ordinance 'a start,' but deficient\n\nThe proposed ordinance would apply to all mobile home parks in Boulder. However, it was written with Vista Village in mind, as the other mobile home parks currently allow pre-1976 homes to remain in place, provided the new owner can pass the background check and other park residency requirements.\n\nMiller did not return a phone call Friday. He has declined several interview requests from the Camera.\n\nThe ordinance is modeled on a similar Connecticut law that was upheld by that state's Supreme Court.\n\nCarr said some of the issues may be slightly different under Colorado's law, but he feels the ordinance has a reasonable chance of withstanding a challenge. He said he is not aware of a local ordinance elsewhere in Colorado that protects the right of mobile home owners to sell their homes within a park.\n\nHowever, some residents are concerned the wording of the ordinance would still give park owners substantial ability to deny a sale, particularly for residents who have criticized them publicly or objected to park policy.\n\n\"It's a start, but it has major deficiencies that will change little in the lives of mobile home owners,\" said Jerry Allen, a resident of Vista Village who wants to sell his home to retire to a cabin in Estes Park.\n\nHe said park management has told him his home must be removed at the time of sale.\n\nThe ordinance says that the park owner cannot require a home to be removed as a condition of sale if it is \"safe and sanitary\" and that a home should be presumed to be safe and sanitary if it was built in accordance with industry standards at the time of its construction, though failure to meet such standards doesn't prove a home is unsafe or unsanitary. It also says homes that pass a city of Boulder rental license inspection are presumed to be safe and sanitary, though such an inspection is not mandatory.\n\nThe ordinance says that within 20 days of being notified that a resident wishes to sell, the park owner must provide in writing either approval of the home's condition for sale or a list of items that must be fixed.\n\nThough the ordinance allows a home owner to dispute a park owner's response, Allen said that provision could be abused by park owners.\n\n\"Typical brick and mortar homes are sold everyday as fixer-uppers, but as now written, anything and everything a park owner cited as needing improvement would be required to be fixed, painted or repaired before the mobile home's sale \u2014 an obvious violation of the homeowner's right to economic gain, as well as the denial of the buyer's choice of improvements for his or her fixer-upper,\" Allen wrote in an email.\n\n\"Bottom line, this ordinance ought to be written as if it were no different than the basic rules and regulations that cover brick and mortar home owners or renters of apartments.\"\n\nThe ordinance authorizes the city manager to make a ruling after a hearing when a violation is alleged. The homeowner would have the burden of proof to show the park owner is violating the law, but the park owner would have the burden of proof to show the home is unsafe.\n\nIf a mobile home park owner were found guilty of a violation, he or she could be subject to a fine of up to $2,000, and the city manager could issue an order for compliance.\n\nThe ordinance also authorizes the city attorney to bring civil actions to enforce the ordinance.\n\nFirst reading for ordinance is Tuesday\n\nJean Gehring, another longtime resident of Vista Village who is concerned she won't be able to sell her home if a space opens up in subsidized senior housing, said she is glad the City Council is considering taking action, but she worries about park owners asking for onerous repairs.\n\n\"I'm glad that they put it on the mobile home park owner to prove that the home is not suitable for sale or habitation,\" she said. \"The one concern that I'm not sure how they would address is that one of the things they do now is they give (homeowners seeking to sell) all kinds of things they have to do before it can be sold.\"\n\nThe City Council holds a first reading of the ordinance Tuesday. There is no public hearing, but people could speak to the ordinance at public comment at the beginning of the meeting.\n\nA second reading and public hearing will be scheduled for a later meeting, most likely in May.\n\nThe City Council will also discuss the creation of a legal fund for homeowners in Vista Village who want to pursue claims under Colorado's Mobile Home Park Act.\n\nErica Meltzer: 303-473-1355, meltzere@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/meltzere", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_27942280/boulder-ordinance-would-protect-mobile-home-sales", "sailthru.author": "By Erica Meltzer \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:27942280:view"}, "startDate": "2015-04-19T09:00:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "An ordinance before the Boulder City Council Tuesday would prohibit the owners of mobile home parks from stopping the sale of mobile homes within the park, provided those homes are \"safe and sanitary.\"", "title": "Boulder ordinance would protect mobile home sales", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_27942280/boulder-ordinance-would-protect-mobile-home-sales", "image": "http://local.dailycamera.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/dailycamera.png", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2015-04-20T06:38:29-0600", "endDate": "2025-04-18T15:06:17-0600", "news_keywords": "Boulder News, Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado news, Boulder News Boulder news, Boulder News Colorado news, US Boulder News news, world Boulder News news.", "byline": "By Erica MeltzerStaff", "pubDate": "2015-04-18T15:28:09-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-04-19T09:00:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "Boulder ordinance would protect mobile home sales", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Boulder News", "description": "An ordinance before the Boulder City Council Tuesday would prohibit the owners of mobile home parks from stopping the sale of mobile homes within the park, provided those homes are \"safe and sanitary.\"", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_27942280/boulder-ordinance-would-protect-mobile-home-sales", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "An ordinance before the Boulder City Council Tuesday would prohibit the owners of mobile home parks from stopping the sale of mobile homes within the park, provided those homes are \"safe and sanitary.\"", "title": "Boulder ordinance would protect mobile home sales"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdc43\"", "article_summary": "Some consider ordinance 'a start,' but deficientThe proposed ordinance would apply to all mobile home parks in Boulder.\nThe homeowner would have the burden of proof to show the park owner is violating the law, but the park owner would have the burden of proof to show the home is unsafe.\nThough the ordinance allows a home owner to dispute a park owner's response, Allen said that provision could be abused by park owners.\n\"I'm glad that they put it on the mobile home park owner to prove that the home is not suitable for sale or habitation,\" she said.\nVista Village residents concerned that ordinance leaves too many loopholesIf You Go What: Boulder City Council When: 6 p.m. Tuesday Where: Boulder Municipal Building, 1777 Broadway Info: To read the proposed ordinance on mobile home sales and to see the rest of the agenda, go to http://bit.ly/1FTOLenAn ordinance before the Boulder City Council Tuesday would prohibit the owners of mobile home parks from stopping the sale of mobile homes within the park, provided those homes are \"safe and sanitary.\""}
