That includes combat as her world slows down and a player simply moves the stick toward the direction of an enemy\u2019s attacks.\n\nHer creepy companion Aiden is much more aggressive. When called upon, the screen turns hazy around the edges and a sparkling blue globule emanates from Ellen tethered to her by an energy stream.\n\nNow, the player moves from a third- to first-person perspective and can rapidly fly around, even through walls. Blue orbs are now interaction points, and moving analog sticks in tandem with triggers can deliver a desired result.\n\nAiden\u2019s powers allow it to take over and possess individuals, choke and blast enemies, shield Jodie from bullets, heal her and even retrieve a recent memory of a traumatic event (a very slick maneuver).\n\nSo what exactly does Aiden\u2019s help, or interference, mean in terms of controlling the life of Jodie and her daily minutia that includes hugging a stuffed animal, throwing a snowball, restlessly turning in a bed, taking a shower, playing a guitar and cooking a meal, to name a few moments?\n\nAs an example, early on in the story, a teen Jodie stops by a birthday party. A player must answer questions from a young suitor and decide if he can have a quick kiss and fondle. She must choose which type of music to play on a boom box. And when her peers turn on her and lock her under a stairwell, Jodie gets her \u201cCarrie\u201d moment.\n\nAiden can cause mayhem that any poltergeist would be proud potentially resulting in the spirit burning down her new worst friend\u2019s house.\n\nOf course, this set of maneuvers get more complicated as the story continues while evil entities invade, and choices can lead to a possible two dozen resolutions to the drama.\n\nThe outstanding motion capture of Miss Page and her surrogate father and research scientist Nathan Dawkins (played beautifully by Willem Dafoe) never stops amazing. Detail down to Miss Page\u2019s watery eye orbs, pouty, chapped lips and freckles are just jaw-dropping.\n\nAdditionally, both actors deliver noteworthy performances amidst a fragmented plot that jumps across time periods of Jodie\u2019s life.\n\nUnfortunately, the game bogs down with extended-cut scenes, which work well for pacing its occasional cinematic payoffs but not for any gaming purist.\n\nIn fact, expect \u201cCall of Duty\u201d-style game fanatics to be nauseated by the decision-making maelstroms and lack of traditional mechanics as they slog through bursts of boredom, terror and excitement.\n\nHowever, the methodical plot development choices will fascinate the more casual gaming human entranced by the gorgeous visual design and familiar with Telltale Games\u2019 The Walking Dead series.\n\nDespite much more story than action, it\u2019s hard not to appreciate the motion-captured, pixilated performance art of Beyond: Two Souls that continues to fuel an evolution that attempts to blur the line between film and game.\n\nNote: Don\u2019t like using a traditional game controller? I\u2019ve got an app for that. A player can install Beyond Touch on his favorite Android or iOS device (such as an iPad) and communicate with his PS3 via a Wi-Fi network to play the game using a device\u2019s touch screen. This clever gimmick works well for Jodie\u2019s movements but fell flat for me when trying to handle Aiden, especially during the more intense, combative situations.\n\nParental advice: The ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board) \u2014 after watching Aiden strangle a SWAT team member, posses a pilot to crash his helicopter and control a soldier to shoot his teammates to death \u2014 decided to label this game in \u201cM\u201d and that stands for mature. Gamers only 17 years and older need be a part of Beyond: Two Souls. Although, I found the game\u2019s violence level much less than an average late-night television show such as \u201cSleepy Hollow,\u201d \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d and \u201cGrimm,\u201d it\u2019s still an \u201cR\u201d-rated movie, and parents should decide if their 15-year-old should buy a ticket.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gamers looking for the latest in interactive cinema get a supernatural thriller starring Ellen Page and Willem Dafoe in Quantic Dream\u2019s latest visual masterpiece.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Gamers looking for the latest in interactive cinema get a supernatural thriller starring Ellen Page and Willem Dafoe in Quantic Dream\u2019s latest visual masterpiece.", "title": "Zadzooks: Beyond: Two Souls review", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/oct/12/zadzooks-beyond-two-souls-review/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/10/12/page-two-souls-800.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/10/12/page-two-souls-800.jpg", "description": "Gamers looking for the latest in interactive cinema get a supernatural thriller starring Ellen Page and Willem Dafoe in Quantic Dream\u2019s latest visual masterpiece.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Zadzooks: Beyond: Two Souls review"}, "Author": "Joseph Szadkowski", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Jodie Holmes, Ellen Page"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc958d\"", "article_summary": "Note: Don\u2019t like using a traditional game controller?\nGamers only 17 years and older need be a part of Beyond: Two Souls.\nGamers looking for the latest in interactive cinema will find a controller-gripping, supernatural thriller in Beyond: Two Souls (Sony Computer Entertainment America and Quantic Dream, rated Mature, $59.99).\nSuffice to report, for those willing to appreciate a 10-hour-long movie, have I got a video game for you.\nA player, rather more director, can maneuver Jodie and allow her to interact by flicking at white orbs in a location using the controller\u2019s analog stick."}
