When incumbent liberal stalwart Rep. Henry Waxman announced his retirement, the 18-candidate primary for the seat turned into a national punchline, attracting a Kardashian-endorsed spiritual guru, an NPR host and a hard-partying former NBC executive.\n\nBut as befits the successor to Waxman, a legislative workhorse, the two candidates who emerged \u2014 State Sen. Ted Lieu, a 45-year-old Democrat, and Los Angeles deputy district attorney Elan Carr, a 46-year-old Republican \u2014 are decidedly low-key figures who share a number of similarities. Both are serving members of the military\u2019s JAG corps (Lieu for the Air Force, Carr for the Army), both belonged to Jewish-founded fraternities (Lieu to Sigma Alpha Mu, Carr to Alpha Epsilon Pi), and both are pitching themselves as relative moderates \u2013 socially liberal, pro-Israel and business friendly.\n\nCarr\u2019s mother emigrated as a child from Iraq to Israel and subsequently to the United States. Carr himself grew up in New York speaking Hebrew and Arabic with his family, and he put the latter skill to use when he served in an anti-terrorism unit in Iraq. He argues that his Iraq experiences will serve him well as a \u201cshaper of opinion\u201d on foreign policy, and particularly on Iran and Israel \u2013 key issues in the seventh-most Jewish district in the country.\n\nCarr\u2019s interest in Israel, in particular, is something he shares with supporter Sheldon Adelson, whom the candidate describes as a \u201cclose personal friend.\u201d Adelson has donated to the Carr campaign and hosted a fundraiser for him.\n\nLieu is an immigrant himself, having arrived in the United States from Taiwan at age 3 with his parents. He has authored bills on everything from greenhouse gas reductions to indoor tanning salons, and he touts his legislative experience as one of his strengths.\n\nVoters, Lieu says, are \u201cvery aware that they\u2019re losing a phenomenal legislator\u201d in Waxman, who has endorsed Lieu. \u201cWith me, you have a track record.\u201d\n\nRegistered Democrats in the district substantially outnumber Republicans, 43.4 percent to 26.8 percent. Raphael Sonenshein, the executive director of California State University, Los Angeles\u2019 Pat Brown Institute \u2014 a nonpartisan public policy institute \u2014 says that Carr has the right profile for a Republican to be successful here, but given the partisan tilt of the district, he is \u201ca substantial underdog.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Anthony Weiss\n\nIn New York, eyeing a new Republican Jew in Congress: Lee Zeldin vs. Tim Bishop\n\nState Sen. Lee Zeldin is adding a new pitch in his second bid to unseat Democratic Rep. Tim Bishop in New York\u2019s 1st Congressional District: Congress needs a Jewish Republican.\n\nZeldin\u2019s religion, and its scarcity among Republican politicos, is by no means his main focus. Local bread-and-butter issues and the economy have dominated the campaign of this 34-year-old Iraq War vet who has served in the state Senate for four years.\n\nBut replacing former Rep. Eric Cantor, the former House majority leader, as the only Republican Jewish lawmaker in the Congress has been part of Zeldin\u2019s outreach both in his eastern Long Island district and in making his case to donors nationally.\n\nZeldin, who met with Cantor after Cantor resigned following his primary loss in Virginia in June, called the former majority leader an \u201cimportant voice in reaching out to the Jewish community here in the United States to encourage them to be more open-minded toward supporting Republican candidates.\u201d\n\nTop conservative Jewish figures, including Weekly Standard publisher Bill Kristol, former George W. Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer and Republican Jewish Coalition executive director Matt Brooks, have traveled to New York to help make Zeldin\u2019s case.\n\nBishop, who acknowledges facing a tough challenge from Zeldin, told JTA that he did not think Zeldin\u2019s religion would be a factor in the vote.\n\n\u201cMy understanding is now that Eric Cantor has left the Congress, he is telling others he will fill that void,\u201d Bishop said in an interview. \u201cThis is not a race about electing someone Jewish.\u201d\n\nBishop noted that both he and his opponent have strong pro-Israel voting records.\n\n\u201cOne thing we are almost unanimous on is the importance of a strong U.S.-Israel relationship and that our posture towards Israel will be protective,\u201d Bishop said.\n\nThis is the fourth time Bishop has faced a Jewish challenger. He defeated Zeldin in 2008, and in 2010 and 2012 he edged Randy Altschuler, an investment banker.\n\nBishop says he is a more natural fit for Jewish voters, who tend to vote Democratic and hold liberal positions on such issues as immigration, health care and education reform.\n\nOn each of those issues, Zeldin and Bishop stake out opposing views. Bishop favors a path to citizenship for undocumented migrants; Zeldin says securing the borders must be a primary priority. Zeldin wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, while preserving elements like mandating coverage for people with pre-existing conditions; Bishop wants to keep it but tweak it. Zeldin wants to toss out the federal Common Core standards for schools; Bishop wants to reform them.\n\nBishop says he backs continued congressional oversight of any Iran deal. Zeldin says Congress needs more aggressive oversight of the nuclear talks.\n\n\u201cWe need to be much stronger and more consistent with our messaging to actually stop Iran\u2019s efforts to obtain a nuclear weapon,\u201d Zeldin told JTA, calling for increased sanctions.\n\nBen Chouake, the president of NORPAC, the pre-eminent pro-Israel political action committee in the Northeast, said pro-Israel donors are not focusing on the Zeldin-Bishop race because they are not so impressed with Bishop and Zeldin has been slipping in the polls.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK to have a good voting record on our issues if you\u2019re from Anchorage, but if you\u2019re from Long Island, people expect more of you than a voting record,\u201d Chouake said. \u201cThey expect leadership.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Ron Kampeas\n\nIn Colorado, tight race in a changing state: Mike Coffman vs. Andrew Romanoff\n\nColorado has spent the past two years in political upheaval, and perhaps no district embodies its contradictions better than the 6th Congressional District. The site of the 2012 Aurora movie theater shooting, the 6th wraps around the east side of Denver, encompassing upscale suburbs, multiracial working-class communities and old-line conservative Colorado natives.\n\nThe two candidates \u2014 Rep. Mike Coffman, a 59-year-old Republican, and former Colorado House Speaker Andrew Romanoff, a 48-year-old Democrat \u2014 embody that split nature perfectly.\n\nCoffman is a Coloradan since childhood and a former Marine who has represented the district since 2008. His maternal grandfather was an Iraqi Jew who moved to the French concession in Shanghai, where his mother grew up until she met his father, a U.S. soldier doing demilitarization in the area at the end of World War II.\n\nLong a conservative, Coffman has been forced to moderate his rhetoric since redistricting turned the 6th from a conservative redoubt into a swing district.\n\nCoffman has worked to paint the Washington-born, Ohio-raised Romanoff as a snooty outsider, sneering in a September debate, \u201cYou went to a private prep school, Harvard, Yale.\u201d A former Wexner fellow, Romanoff presents his career in public service and education \u2014 ranging from teaching at the Community College of Aurora to working at the Southern Poverty Law Center to serving in the statehouse \u2014 as springing from his Jewish upbringing.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s shaped who I am in almost every way,\u201d he told JTA. \u201cI take seriously the obligation we call tikkun olam.\u201d\n\nRomanoff and Coffman have focused heavily on domestic issues, particularly economic. Romanoff has also played up his refusal to take money from political action committees, or PACs, as freeing him from special interests. It certainly hasn\u2019t prevented Romanoff from bringing in the big money, as both candidates had raised well over $3 million by the end of the second quarter. However, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced recently that it was cutting off its television advertising in the district \u2014 a move that some analysts took as a sign that Romanoff\u2019s chances might be slipping. Nonetheless, the result will likely remain in doubt to the very end.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a very close race,\u201d said Seth Masket, an associate professor of political science at the University of Denver. \u201cCoffman probably maintains a very slight lead, but both are very strong candidates.\u201d\n\nMasket says Romanoff may be saved, ironically, by the difficulties of his fellow Colorado Democrats running for re-election as senator and governor. Their close races have caused the state and national parties to pour millions into voter turnout efforts across the state, which might mitigate the greater tendency of Democratic voters to ignore non-presidential elections.\n\nThat could be a godsend for Romanoff. Asked what would make the ultimate difference in the election, Romanoff bluntly responded, \u201cTurnout.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Anthony Weiss\n\nIn Illinois, who\u2019s the favorite in Chicago? Brad Schneider vs. Robert Dold\n\nBrad Schneider and Robert Dold, locked in a neck-and-neck race for a Chicago-area congressional seat, present a dilemma for some Jewish voters.\n\nDold, 45, is a Republican social moderate in the tradition of now-Sen. Mark Kirk, his predecessor in the 10th Congressional District. Dold, who held the seat for one two-year term before losing narrowly to Schneider in 2012, represents what many Jewish community leaders have said they long to see: a pro-Israel hawk who strives to keep a national party that has tilted rightward since 2010 on a more even keel.\n\nSchneider, the 53-year-old incumbent, represents a prototype Jewish Democrats want to preserve: a young, liberal Jewish lawmaker who makes Israel a central focus and casts it as a natural issue for Democrats.\n\nJewish voters \u201care looking for a fiscal conservative and social moderate, someone who can be in the tradition of Mark Kirk,\u201d Dold said in an interview. \u201cPeople are tired of excuses and they want Washington to work. I have a track record of working with the other side.\u201d\n\nSchneider, almost echoing Dold, pitched himself in an interview as a \u201cfiscally moderate, socially progressive\u201d candidate, and in making his case slips into the Hebrew he learned on multiple visits to Israel.\n\n\u201cTwo things I talk about is tikkun olam,\u201d he said, using the phrase for repairing the world, and \u201cl\u2019dor v\u2019dor,\u201d from generation to generation. \u201cWe can\u2019t leave an environment beyond repair.\u201d\n\nOn issues like the Affordable Care Act and Israel, the candidates sound similar notes: Each favors tweaks to Obamacare but not repeal, and each says he will stand up to the administration if it gives too much away in nuclear talks between Iran and the major powers.\n\nThe candidates, digging deep into their opponent\u2019s record, score each other on these issues.\n\nDold says \u201cthere\u2019s no question\u201d that Schneider is pro-Israel, but chides him for not speaking out more against the administration \u2014 for instance, when Secretary of State John Kerry warned earlier this year that Israel one day could become an apartheid state.\n\nSchneider notes that this year he initiated a bipartisan letter pressing the administration to increase Iran sanctions at a time when it was resisting such calls. He also points out that Dold voted to repeal Obamacare during his term in Congress; Dold says he now favors bipartisan fixes for Obamacare.\n\nJewish officials say Schneider has the edge in part because, with a background as an activist with the American Jewish Committee and with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, he is so steeped in the community.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t ask for a better friend to Israel,\u201d said Marcia Balonick, the director of JACPAC, a political action committee with a focus on Israel, abortion rights and church-state separation. \u201cIn his former life he was an active member of the Jewish community, he speaks fluent Hebrew, he\u2019s already taken several missions to Israel.\u201d\n\nJACPAC in the past has sought out moderate Republicans to endorse, including Kirk, in part to help preserve that wing of the party. Dold has told the group that he would resist attempts to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court ruling enshrining a woman\u2019s right to an abortion, but will not vote for funding for abortions for poor women, which is a non-starter.\n\nNORPAC, a leading New Jersey-based pro-Israel political action committee, endorsed Schneider under the \u201cfriendly incumbent\u201d rule for pro-Israel givers: Do not alienate the lawmaker in office.\n\n\u2014 Ron Kampeas", "article_metadata": {"description": "A look at some key congressional races featuring Jewish candidates.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.6", "og": {"site_name": "Jewish Telegraphic Agency", "description": "A look at some key congressional races featuring Jewish candidates.", "title": "Midterm elections: Jews facing off and other close races to watch", "locale": "en_us", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://www.jta.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/u.s._capitol-e1406306016588.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 668}, "url": "http://www.jta.org/2014/10/14/news-opinion/politics/midterm-elections-jews-facing-off-and-other-close-races-to-watch", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Jewish Telegraphic Agency", "description": "A look at some key congressional races featuring Jewish candidates.", "title": "Midterm elections: Jews facing off and other close races to watch", "image": {"src": "http://www.jta.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/u.s._capitol-e1406306016588.jpg"}, "site": "@jtanews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 609545035801692}, "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "United States", "published_time": "2014-10-14T21:05:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-05T04:20:26+00:00", "author": "http://www.jta.org/author/aweiss"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9456\"", "article_summary": "(JTA) \u2014 With midterm elections just around the corner, four races for the House of Representatives in particular are catching our Jewish eyes.\nOn each of those issues, Zeldin and Bishop stake out opposing views.\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a very close race,\u201d said Seth Masket, an associate professor of political science at the University of Denver.\n\u201cWith me, you have a track record.\u201dRegistered Democrats in the district substantially outnumber Republicans, 43.4 percent to 26.8 percent.\nBishop, who acknowledges facing a tough challenge from Zeldin, told JTA that he did not think Zeldin\u2019s religion would be a factor in the vote."}
