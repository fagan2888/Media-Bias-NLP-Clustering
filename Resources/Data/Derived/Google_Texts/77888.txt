Sioux Falls, SD

In 2014, Scheels Sporting Goods store will open up after a multi-million dollar expansion. The construction project is costing about $25 million and is expected to be complete next May.

The Scheels construction project will double the size of the building from 100,000 square feet to 200,000 square feet.

The new expansion will add a lot of new family fun features, like a Ferris Wheel, a restaurant that will serve soup, salad and sandwiches, a bike shop and so much more.

“We'll have a small miniature bowling ally, two lanes of that. There will be some photo opportunities, some simulators and some shooting galleries. It will be a great experience for the customers when they come in,” Store Leader Chris Kray said.

The new expansion will also bring 100 new jobs to the store, growing the staff from 317 associates to nearly 450 associates.

The renovation project will be complete in May 2014.
