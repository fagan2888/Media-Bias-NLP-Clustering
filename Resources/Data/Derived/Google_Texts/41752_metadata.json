He lay on the ice after the hit for nearly 20 seconds before scampering off, then immediately headed down the tunnel toward the dressing room to receive medical attention.\n\nFehr played just two shifts, totaling 1:19 of ice time. Jay Beagle, who began the game alongside Fehr as the third-line right wing, took a number of faceoffs in Fehr\u2019s absence, while fourth-line center Brooks Laich also took shifts alongside Beagle and left wing Jason Chimera.\n\nCoach Barry Trotz said approximately 20 minutes after the game that he didn\u2019t have an update on Fehr\u2019s health. If he can\u2019t return for Game 4 on Tuesday, his spot in the lineup could conceivably be taken by Michael Latta, who was a healthy scratch the last two games.\n\nIn addition to Fehr, left wing Marcus Johansson missed the final six minutes of the first period after taking a hit from Islanders right wing Cal Clutterbuck, but he was back on the ice for his first shift of the second period.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fehr was attempting to play the puck in the corner at 3:11 of the first period when he took a hit from Islanders right wing Kyle Okposo.
