James Martin, special to CNN\n\n(CNN) - With Easter approaching, and the movie \u201cSon of God\u201d playing in wide release, you\u2019re going to hear a lot about Jesus these days.\n\nYou may hear revelations from new books that purport to tell the \u201creal story\u201d about Jesus, opinions from friends who have discovered a \u201csecret\u201d on the Web about the son of God, and airtight arguments from co-workers who can prove he never existed.\n\nBeware of most of these revelations; many are based on pure speculation and wishful thinking. Much of what we know about Jesus has been known for the last 2,000 years.\n\nStill, even for devout Christian there are surprises to be found hidden within the Gospels, and thanks to advances in historical research and archaeological discoveries, more is known about his life and times.\n\nWith that in mind, here are five things you probably didn't know about Jesus.\n\n1.) Jesus came from a nowhere little town.\n\nNearly all modern-day archaeologists agree the town of Nazareth had only 200 to 400 people. Jesus\u2019 hometown is mentioned nowhere in either the Old Testament or the Talmud, which notes dozens of other towns in the area.\n\nIn fact, in the New Testament it is literally a joke.\n\nIn the Gospel of John, when a man named Nathanael hears the messiah is \u201cJesus of Nazareth,\u201d he asks, \u201cCan anything good come from Nazareth?\u201d He\u2019s dissing Jesus\u2019 crummy backwater town.\n\n2.) Jesus probably didn\u2019t know everything.\n\nThis is a thorny theological question. If Jesus is divine, wouldn\u2019t he know all things? (Indeed, on several occasions Jesus predicts his death and resurrection.)\n\nOn the other hand, if he had a human consciousness, he needed to be taught something before he could know it. The Gospel of Luke says that when Jesus was a young man he \u201cprogressed\u201d in wisdom. That means he learned things. (Otherwise how would he \u201cprogress\u201d?)\n\nIn the Gospel of Mark, Jesus initially refuses to heal the daughter of a non-Jewish woman, saying rather sharply, \u201cIt is not fair to take the children\u2019s food and throw it to the dogs.\u201d\n\nBut when she replies that even the dogs get the crumbs from the table, Jesus softens, and he heals her daughter. He seems to be learning that his ministry extends beyond the Jewish people.\n\n3.) Jesus was tough.\n\nFrom age 12 to 30, Jesus worked in Nazareth as a carpenter. \u201cIs not this the carpenter?\u201d say the astonished crowds when he begins to preach.\n\nThe word used for Jesus\u2019 profession in the original Greek is tekton. The traditional translation is \u201ccarpenter.\u201d But most contemporary scholars say it\u2019s more likely a general craftsman; some even translate it as \u201cday laborer.\u201d\n\nA tekton would have made doors, tables, lamp stands and plows. But he probably also built stone walls and helped with house construction.\n\nIt was tough work that meant lugging tools, wood and stones all over Galilee. Jesus doesn\u2019t simply stride onto the world stage after having dreamily examined a piece of wood when the mood suited him. For 18 years, he worked\u2014and worked hard.\n\n4.) Jesus needed \u201cme time.\u201d\n\nThe Gospels frequently speak of Jesus\u2019 need to \u201cwithdraw\u201d from the crowds, and even his disciples.\n\nToday by the Sea of Galilee, where Jesus carried out much of his ministry, you can see how close the towns were, and how natural it would have been for the enthusiastic crowds to \u201cpress\u201d in on him, as the Gospels describe.\n\nThere\u2019s even a cave on the shoreline, not far from Capernaum, his base of operations, where he may have prayed.\n\nIt\u2019s called the \u201cEremos Cave,\u201d from the word for \u201cdesolate\u201d or \u201csolitary,\u201d from which we get the word \u201chermit.\u201d Even though Jesus was the son of God, he needed time alone in prayer with the father.\n\n5.) Jesus didn\u2019t want to die.\n\nAs he approaches his death, and prays hard in the garden of Gethsemane, Jesus says, \u201cRemove this cup.\u201d It\u2019s a blunt prayer addressed to the father, whom he affectionately calls Abba. He doesn\u2019t want to die.\n\nUnlike the way some Christians portray Jesus as courting death, and even desiring it, like any human being, the idea of death is terrifying. \u201cMy soul is sorrowful even unto death,\u201d he says.\n\nIn other words, \u201cI\u2019m so sad that it feels like I\u2019m going to die.\u201d But once Jesus realizes that this is somehow the will of the father, he assents to death, even on a cross.\n\nIt\u2019s natural to want to know as much as we can about Jesus; that\u2019s one reason I wrote my new book. But beware of the more outlandish claims about the son of God (he fathered children, he was married to Mary Magdalene, he spent time in India and so on.)\n\nMany of these claims tend to project our own desires on a man who will always remain somewhat elusive, hard to fully understand and impossible to pin down.\n\nIn the end, as theologians like to say, Jesus is not so much a problem to be solved as a mystery to be pondered.\n\nThe Rev.
