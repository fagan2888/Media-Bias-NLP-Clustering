He and his wife Amy lease a half-acre plot on the scenic, exclusive northernmost point of Madeline Island. The Funks began leasing their property seven years ago as part of the Amnicon Bay Association, a group of about 18 non-Native people who lease a 17-acre tract of land called Amnicon Bay from the Bad River Ojibwe Tribe of Wisconsin. The 50-year lease, which began in 1967, ends in August 2017. Tribal leaders and members have declared they will not renew the lucrative lease that has brought in a dependable income from the land located over 30 miles and a ferry ride from the main reservation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve paid out more than two million dollars to the tribe over the years,\u201d according to Peggy Swartz, 81, the last remaining lease-holder from among the original seven members who comprised the association. She thinks it would not make good fiscal sense for the tribe to take the land back.\n\nSwartz\u2019s focus on money and Funk\u2019s question lay bare the gap of race, class and culture that has long existed between Native and non-Native folks here on the Island, now home to upper-crust tourists. Their attitudes betray, albeit innocently, the entitlement and ignorance of history so often displayed by non-Native people who occupy Native land.\n\n\u201cIt makes me uncomfortable to know that the tribe doesn\u2019t want us here. It is their land, after all,\u201d said Amy Fund, an attorney from Minneapolis who frequently represents disenfranchised clients on a pro-bono basis.\n\nAs specified in the lease, the Funks and other Bay members have maintained the land and kept up their homes. All that time and effort has created a tie to the area that is difficult to surrender. The Funks speak of leaving with a resigned acceptance tinged with frustration.\n\nLike most of her fellow association members, however, she has never spoken directly to tribal members. \u201cPlease tell them that we are nice people,\u201d she asked earnestly.\n\nIn many ways, the barriers between Native and non-Native communication aren\u2019t difficult to identify. They are typical of the racial, class and economic divisions among many Americans. For instance, according to a study by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, the average tourist visiting the Apostle Islands area is overwhelming white, well-educated, with an income over $100,000. Most folks from Odanah, however, get along near the federal poverty line; most people don\u2019t go on to college.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A group of 18 non-Native people leasing land from the Bad River Ojibwe Tribe of Wisconsin, could see the lease come to an end in 2017.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/03/05/bad-river-ojibwe-tribe-reclaims-amnicon-bay-153838", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/bad_river_ojibwe_tribe_reclaims_amnicon_bay_-_mary_annette_pember.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Bad River Ojibwe Tribe Reclaims Amnicon Bay"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dc": {"title": "Bad River Ojibwe Tribe Reclaims Amnicon Bay"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/03/05/bad-river-ojibwe-tribe-reclaims-amnicon-bay-153838", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "dcterms.date": "2014-03-05T09:00-05:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Amnicon Bay Association, Bad River Ojibwe Tribe of Wisconsin, Harry Funk, Amnicon Bay, Tribal Lands, non-Native Leasing, Edith Leoso, Bad River Tribal Historic Preservation Officer, Gitchee Gummee, 1978 Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Mike Wiggins", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 2}, "dcterms.title": "Bad River Ojibwe Tribe Reclaims Amnicon Bay"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd42c8\"", "article_summary": "The Funks began leasing their property seven years ago as part of the Amnicon Bay Association, a group of about 18 non-Native people who lease a 17-acre tract of land called Amnicon Bay from the Bad River Ojibwe Tribe of Wisconsin.\nLike most of her fellow association members, however, she has never spoken directly to tribal members.\nAs specified in the lease, the Funks and other Bay members have maintained the land and kept up their homes.\nTheir attitudes betray, albeit innocently, the entitlement and ignorance of history so often displayed by non-Native people who occupy Native land.\nShe thinks it would not make good fiscal sense for the tribe to take the land back."}
