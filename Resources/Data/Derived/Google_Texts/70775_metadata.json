That foray came to an end after wrangling with state regulators, who must approve any combination. Top brass at both chains grew frustrated after submitting tens of thousands of pages of documents to state health department officials and then-Attorney General Patrick Lynch. Under Rhode Island law, the attorney general\u2019s office must approve any hospital merger.\n\nAt that time, the unions representing thousands of hospital employees were wary of a merger. And Lynch was a candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor in a primary where the health care employee unions are strong forces. Lynch eventually aborted his race for the nomination and went into private law practice.\n\nThe two organizations also sought regulatory approval to combine in 1998, but withdrew that application in 2000.\n\nAt the time of the 2010 decision to close the effort, both sides cited such issues as the difficult economic climate, the rapid pace of changes in the medical care landscape, both locally and nationally, and the tough competition from Boston hospitals and Massachusetts-based medical care providers.\n\nSome of those factors are in play, but the recent evolution of medical care in southern New England may augur in favor of such a combination now. Obamacare and the expansion of the federal Medicaid program have given hospitals more revenue. Yet, the competition from Massachusetts is, if anything, stronger than ever, with Bay State health providers moving relentlessly to poach patients, particularly those with private health insurance, from Rhode Island.\n\nA merger would make sense on many levels, especially in building a stronger Rhode Island-based medical provider network. Many medical observers have long wondered why Women & Infants Hospital, which shares a campus with Rhode Island Hospital, is in Care New England, while Rhode is part of Lifespan.\n\nWhat also is new is the leadership of the respective organizations. In 2010, the Care New England president was John Hynes and George Vecchione led Lifespan. Now Babineau is leading Lifespan and Dennis Keefe is ceo at Care New England.\n\nIn a statement, Care New England acknowledged that it is in negotiations with prospective partners, but declined comment on which medical providers its executives are talking with.\n\nState Human Services Director Elizabeth Roberts declined substantive comment when queried recently. She said through spokesman Mike Raia that state health officials do not want to ``weigh in at this time.\u2019\u2019\n\n``We will continue to explore possible affiliation and partnership options for the future of Care New England,\u2019\u2019 the statement released by May Kernan, the organization\u2019s spokeswoman. ``We have no specific comment on particular entities with whom we are in confidential negotiations, but should any of these discussions result in a closer partnership or affiliation, we would continue our practice of making a public announcement at the appropriate time.\u2019\u2019\n\nSaid Babineau, ``It\u2019s a process, we\u2019ll see where it ends up.\u2019\u2019", "article_metadata": {"category": "The Pulse", "description": "Lifespan and Care New England, Rhode Island\u2019s two largest hospital systems, have quietly revived merger talks, Lifespan ceo and president, Dr. Timothy", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "The Pulse", "og": {"url": "http://ripr.org/post/lifespan-care-new-england-quietly-revive-merger-talks", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wrni/files/styles/medium/public/201510/triage_in_rhode_island_hospital_emergency_department.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Lifespan and Care New England, Rhode Island\u2019s two largest hospital systems, have quietly revived merger talks, Lifespan ceo and president, Dr. Timothy", "title": "Lifespan, Care New England Quietly Revive Merger Talks"}, "story_id": 449975005, "twitter": {"site": "@RINPR", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ScotMackRI"}, "author": "Scott MacKay", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Lifespan, Care New England Quietly Revive Merger Talks"}, "nid": 58226, "datePublished": "2015-10-19", "keywords": "care new england, Affordable Care Act, obamacare, Dr. Timothy Babineau, dennis keefe, lifespan, RI health care, Rhode Island Hospital, May Kernan, scott mackay, Elizabeth Roberts, RI Medicaid", "wordCount": 623, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Lifespan and Care New England, Rhode Island\u2019s two largest hospital systems, have quietly revived merger talks, Lifespan ceo and president, Dr. Timothy Babineau, said today.\nAnd Lynch was a candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor in a primary where the health care employee unions are strong forces.\nAt the time of the 2010 decision to close the effort, both sides cited such issues as the difficult economic climate, the rapid pace of changes in the medical care landscape, both locally and nationally, and the tough competition from Boston hospitals and Massachusetts-based medical care providers.\nNow Babineau is leading Lifespan and Dennis Keefe is ceo at Care New England.\nSome of those factors are in play, but the recent evolution of medical care in southern New England may augur in favor of such a combination now."}
