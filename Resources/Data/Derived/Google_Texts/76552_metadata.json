India has a problem of systemic, horrific violence against its women\u2014perhaps not more than other nations, but certainly not any better, either. The preconceptions about rape, sexuality and gender were not challenged by any number of stories preceding this one; why should Jyoti Singh\u2019s story be any different?\n\nFor whatever reason, it was. Protests shook both the capital city of Delhi\u2014India\u2019s \u201crape capital\u201c\u2014and outrage spread not just to the rest of India but to the rest of the world. In this climate, Leslee Udwin, a novice filmmaker, went to India to attempt to tell the story of a woman the media was beginning to call \u201cIndia\u2019s daughter.\u201d The resulting documentary\u2014\u201cIndia\u2019s Daughter\u201d\u2014is, itself, a remarkably balanced documentary, one that distinguishes itself from other accounts of sexual assault by interviewing the rapists and their team of defense lawyers. The only convicted rapist who admits to what he did was the driver, Mukesh Singh, and interviews with him take up nearly as much screentime as the interviews with Jyoti\u2019s bereaved parents.\n\nWhat immediately followed the film was controversy. As the New Yorker reports:\n\nAfter clips of the Mukesh Singh interview began circulating online, the Indian government stopped the scheduled Indian broadcast of \u201cIndia\u2019s Daughter,\u201d which was set for March 8th, International Women\u2019s Day. On March 4th, a statement from the Indian Home Minister\u2019s office said that the government was enforcing a ban because Udwin hadn\u2019t secured the correct permissions to interview Singh in prison, didn\u2019t abide by agreements to show authorities unedited versions of the interview, and because Singh\u2019s statements are \u201can affront to the dignity of women.\u201d (Udwin has since published copies of the letters of permission she received.) In another statement, the government warned that clips from the film \u201cappear to encourage and incite violence against women.\u201d Some supporters of the ban say that airing the Singh interview is tantamount to giving a platform to the rapist\u2019s views; others say that the documentary paints sexual violence as an Indian issue rather than a global one, and fear that it will perpetuate a \u201cwhite-savior\u201d attitude in foreign viewers. That the government finds the film nationally embarrassing is a likely reason for the ban\u2014members of the ruling B.J.P party have stated that the film is part of \u201can international conspiracy to defame India\u201d and have protested that its release will affect tourism.\n\nIndia is notorious for banning media that hint at the controversial; restricted topics include homosexuality, alternative histories of Hinduism, examinations of revered politicians, and of course, rape. In this case, as with most of the others, it speaks of cowardice. \u201cIndia\u2019s Daughter\u201d has benefited from the publicity surrounding the decision, as illegal copies have proliferated online, but the ban effectively stopped the film from being seen by the people it is about \u2014 the poorest and most disconnected segments of the population, the ones struggling most to survive in the most populous country in the world.\n\nBeyond the government\u2019s actions, Udwin\u2019s documentary has sparked a conversation that is very familiar to media criticism in 2015\u2014the ongoing questions of who has the right to tell which kinds of stories. Udwin is an Israeli Londoner, and \u201cIndia\u2019s Daughter\u201d entirely concerns people and events in Northern India. The best intentions in the world cannot erase the racial implications of such a power dynamic, and as \u201cIndia\u2019s Daughter\u201d has become such an object of discussion in the press, Udwin herself has begun to sound embattled and defensive. I would characterize my own conversation with her as a bit rancorous.\n\nBelow is my conversation with Udwin; following that are a few closing thoughts from myself and Freida Pinto, who is an ambassador for \u201cIndia\u2019s Daugher.\u201d\n\nHow did you come to this topic? I know that you are not Indian yourself.\n\nYes. Well, as a global citizen, and a woman who cares very deeply about the fact that we are still subordinated to men, that we are still lacking in proper respect and representation\u2014true representation, in the world in terms of decision making, in terms of economies and in terms of being independent, and very much in terms of us being unsafe.\n\nWe know that on a daily basis, every single second, somewhere a woman or a girl is being violently abused and violated. What brought me to the topic was not so much the rape and the case and the darkness of that. It was the light and the horizon of seeing this mass mobilization of the Indian men and women. It was awe-inspiring to me, to see such mass mobilization on India\u2019s streets fighting for my rights.\n\nI took it personally, and I thought the least I could do\u2014when these people were being so courageous and so committed to this issue, and facing the most ferocious government crackdown on peaceful protesters\u2014the least I could do was make a film that would be like a megaphone for those voices and join in the protest in that way. That was my way of joining them.\n\nSo I believe this is your first documentary film, right?\n\nRight, yes, and the first time I\u2019ve directed as well.\n\nHow did it even occur to you to make a film about this? Were you hoping to make a film at some point already? Was India set in your sights at that point?\n\nNo, no. Not at all. I had no intentions ever of making a documentary film. But it basically took on its own volition. It became a compulsion for me. I didn\u2019t choose to do it. And you know, I didn\u2019t choose India. If these protests had happened in any other country, in any other part of the world, I would\u2019ve gone there and have made that particular case of those protests.\n\nI have been up to this point a producer of feature films. I decided to direct the film because I couldn\u2019t afford to hire a director. But I had so much fire in my belly, I was so utterly compelled to make this film, that I had to just go and do it. Obviously I researched very thoroughly before I did it, I didn\u2019t just step on a plane, but I had to do it and therefore by ordinary means, and the means that I had were private means, whatever I had of family savings. And I\u2019ve used them all. [Laughs.]\n\nHad you been to India before, or was it a completely new experience?\n\nMany times. I\u2019ve had a very close, loving relationship with India, which is why it hurts my heart so much that they have banned this film, you know. And that they even think of accusing me of a conspiracy to shame India\u2014what absolute nonsense. You know, this is a conspiracy to praise India and thank India for being the only country in the world that has come out with such force and vigor and passion and tenacity for women\u2019s rights, to try and make the world a better place for women and girls. There\u2019s not another country on earth that has done that. I went to praise India, not to bury it. Sadly, shame has now appeared to India. But not from the film. From the ban. From the fact that they have banned a film that simply asks for a better world for women and girls. And they have banned the film without even seeing it, which is shameful. It\u2019s so ridiculous.\n\nA lot of the media that I read coming out of India about this film suggested a lot of wounded pride or a sense of violation about having a filmmaker who was not Indian make this story that is centered on India in this way. How did you tackle that concern, and how did you respond to that criticism?\n\nWell, here\u2019s how I respond. I can understand that certain segments of the Indian population \u2014 and believe me, they\u2019re in the minority \u2014 I can understand that they have a postcolonial chip on their shoulder. This is what this is emanating from. They call me a British journalist. I am neither a journalist nor British, OK. There\u2019s a kind of exterior that has flown in the face of facts and proper research. And that\u2019s very sad. Because it boomerangs back on the people who are bandying these terms about. They call me a \u201cgori.\u201d You know what that means?\n\nI do know what that means.\n\nThat\u2019s a derogatory word for a white-skinned person. [Note: The word is used for anyone fair-skinned, including Indians, and is considered mild enough that it is featured in both Bollywood lyrics and \u201cBend It Like Beckham.\u201d]\n\nI\u2019m Jewish. In my people\u2019s history, there was a Holocaust in Germany. If I lived my life constantly keeping that paramount in my mind and letting that filter what is right and what is wrong in terms of what is happening around me, I wouldn\u2019t move very far. I think it\u2019s backward-looking. They have to forget about the colonial era, and whatever ax they have to grind with the Brits, let them grind it. You know, let them move on from grinding it, actually! It\u2019s not my fight. I\u2019m not British, OK?\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. Any people who refuse to introspect need to really examine their conscience as to why that is. Is your image as a country really more important than saving the lives of your women and girls? Because if that\u2019s what you\u2019re saying, then I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have any respect or time for that attitude. You see, I watched as MPs in the Lok Sabha, the Indian Parliament, the morning after the ban were screaming like headless chickens in hysterics. \u201cShe\u2019s decimating our tourist industry.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s a conspiracy to shame India,\u201d they were screaming that when they hadn\u2019t even seen the film. There hadn\u2019t even been the possibility for them to see the film because at that point it existed on one thumb drive in my purse. So you know, we shouldn\u2019t give this any credence. We should see it as part of the change-resisting backwards-looking segments of the population. And they don\u2019t only just exist in India. They exist all over the world. There are those people who resist change. There are those people who welcome change and look forward to it. And there are a handful of people who are actively working to change. I know which category I\u2019d like to be in.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk a little bit about what is the linchpin of your film, which is this very disturbing set of interviews with Mukesh, one of the convicted rapists.\n\nCorrect. Yes. I interviewed seven rapists over 31 hours. Four of them had nothing to do with this case. One of those four had raped a 5-year-old girl. I sat and interviewed him for three hours. And the reason why I interviewed others who were not involved in this particular case was because I felt the need to practice. Because I was raped when I was 18, and I\u2019m ashamed to say I\u2019ve kept silent about it for 20 years. I didn\u2019t know to what degree the demons inside me that I had buried would rise up. Also, I\u2019d never made a documentary before. I\u2019d never interviewed people before. So I was relying on who I am and what I cared about, you know?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salon talks to Leslee Udwin about the controversy around \"India's Daughter\" and to Freida Pinto about her support", "title": "\u201cI am infuriated by India right now\u201d: Delhi gang-rape documentary director lashes out against government ban on \u201cIndia\u2019s Daughter\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Salon talks to Leslee Udwin about the controversy around \"India's Daughter\" and to Freida Pinto about her support", "title": "\u201cI am infuriated by India right now\u201d: Delhi gang-rape documentary director lashes out against government ban on \u201cIndia\u2019s Daughter\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/15/i_am_infuriated_by_india_right_now_delhi_gang_rape_documentary_director_lashes_out_against_government_ban_on_indias_daughter/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/Indias_daughter.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Salon talks to Leslee Udwin about the controversy around \"India's Daughter\" and to Freida Pinto about her support", "title": "\u201cI am infuriated by India right now\u201d: Delhi gang-rape documentary director lashes out against government ban on \u201cIndia\u2019s Daughter\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/Indias_daughter.jpg", "creator": "@soniasaraiya", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sonia Saraiya", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, freida pinto, India's Daughter, leslee udwin, PBS, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "So I believe this is your first documentary film, right?\nI had no intentions ever of making a documentary film.\nUdwin is an Israeli Londoner, and \u201cIndia\u2019s Daughter\u201d entirely concerns people and events in Northern India.\nFrom the fact that they have banned a film that simply asks for a better world for women and girls.\nIndia has a problem of systemic, horrific violence against its women\u2014perhaps not more than other nations, but certainly not any better, either."}
