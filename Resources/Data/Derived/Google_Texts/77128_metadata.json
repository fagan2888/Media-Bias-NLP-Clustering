So Fox dropped the actual news in order to do the hatchet job it longed for.\n\nMuch of the reason Benghazi became Benghazi is because of Fox News. It\u2019s the network that made just about any and every news story about Benghazi. Charlie Hebdo, Ferguson, even the missing Malaysian airliner all made Fox News pundits just happen to think of Benghazi. According to Media Matters, Fox ran nearly 1,100 segments about Benghazi in the first 20 months after the tragedy. But on the day that Hillary Clinton \u2013 the target of both Fox News and the Benghazi hearings \u2013 actually testified, Fox was the first network to drop its coverage of the hearing.\n\nFrom Mediaite:\n\nCNN, MSNBC, and Fox had all covered the the (sic) first two segments of the hearing live. After a second short break, the committee reconvened at 5 pm. CNN and MSNBC went back to covering it live. Fox News showed video of the committee getting back to business, but the audio was muted as the hosts of The Five provided their analysis of the hearing thus far.\n\nWhat Mediaite calls \u201canalysis\u201d of the hearing, anybody who\u2019s neither a Fox fan nor looking for a Murdoch buyout would call \u201cpromoting Republican talking points.\u201d \u201cWhy did she [Clinton] lie? Because she was trying to save her own skin,\u201d cohost Greg Gutfeld \u201canalysed.\u201d He followed up with, \u201cThe constant refrain from this hearing was that [Ambassador] Chris Stevens chose his destiny. When [Rep.] Adam Smith says he chose to go to Benghazi, it\u2019s the political version of saying, \u2018He shouldn\u2019t have gone out dressed like that. He should have worn a bra.\u2019 I mean, he\u2019s basically saying that he had it coming.\u2019\u201d Cohost Kimberly Guilfoyle could be heard agreeing off camera.\n\nClearly, as Erik Wemple pointed out, the hearing was going nowhere. He wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s just a little precious that this network, the Benghazi network, made the call to move away. Just goes to show that the ideology of Fox News may appear to be Benghazi and Kill Obamacare, but it\u2019s really ratings.\u201d\n\nWemple may be right about the ratings. But Fox\u2019s decision shows something else: when the actual news isn\u2019t going Fox's way, they ditch it in order to make up their own version.\n\nWatch The Five do that, below, from the October 22 show.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "wKEuseH0vpZgsr2Rvm1zopW82nvUOWPbqQuyhwnjNAA=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/fox_news_stopped_covering_clinton_s_benghazi_testimony_in_order_to_bash_her_102315", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "Fox News Stopped Covering Clinton\u2019s Benghazi Testimony In Order To Bash Her"}, "Title": "Fox News Stopped Covering Clinton\u2019s Benghazi Testimony In Order To Bash Her"}, "article_summary": "He wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s just a little precious that this network, the Benghazi network, made the call to move away.\nMuch of the reason Benghazi became Benghazi is because of Fox News.\nAccording to Media Matters, Fox ran nearly 1,100 segments about Benghazi in the first 20 months after the tragedy.\nFrom Mediaite:CNN, MSNBC, and Fox had all covered the the (sic) first two segments of the hearing live.\nApparently, yesterday\u2019s Benghazi hearing wasn\u2019t landing enough blows against Hillary Clinton."}
