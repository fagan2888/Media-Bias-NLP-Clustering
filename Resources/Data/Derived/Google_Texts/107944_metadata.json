Mary Jane\u2019s Bridge\n\nYou can hear various stories about how the spirit said to haunt this small bridge on Bayou Tortue Road near Broussard became a spirt: a murdered prom date, the victim of a serial ax killer, and more. Former Daily Advertiser staffer Jim Bradshaw wrote that people sometimes see an apparition on the anniversary of the girl\u2019s death. A former police officer wrote Bradshaw that he\u2019d seen a girl, dressed in white with long brown hair, on the bridge on an inexplicably cold August night in 1985.\n\n2. Chretien Point\n\nAn 1830s-vintage plantation, Chretien Point was a 3,000-acre cotton producer. The mistress of the plantation was Felicit\u00e9 Chretien, who worked like a man and joined her husband and his friends for cigars and poker in the 12-room mansion. Her husband died young, but Felicit\u00e9 carried on. When a bandit slipped into the home one night, Felicit\u00e9 shot him dead on the grand staircase that would later be the model for \u201cGone With the Wind.\u201d The Chretien Point website says visitors report that Felicit\u00e9 appears now again to say, \u201cI\u2019ll see your hundred and raise you 20.\u201d\n\n3. Susie Plantation\n\nThis early 19th-century plantation home in Centreville is said to be haunted by a former slave and by a plantation mistress who died in childbirth a couple of years after her husband accepted the plantation as a dowry.\n\n4. The Nichols Home\n\nThis house in the town of Washington is said to have served as a Civil War hospital. The ghost here is an amputee who was never properly discharged.\n\n5. Shadows on the Teche\n\nPoor Miss Mary Moore. She was the mistress of the New Iberia plantation, built in the 1830s. She died there when the home was occupied during the Civil War. Hauntedplaces.org says she shows up occasionally as a misty figure and as footsteps on the second floor and in the attic.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/opinion/columnists/decker/2014/10/26/deckers-list-acadiana-ghost-stories/17967577/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Those plantation mistresses just don\u2019t want to go peacefully.", "og": {"site_name": "The Advertiser", "description": "Those plantation mistresses just don\u2019t want to go peacefully.", "title": "Decker\u2019s List: 5 Acadiana Ghost Stories", "url": "http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/opinion/columnists/decker/2014/10/26/deckers-list-acadiana-ghost-stories/17967577/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/theadvertiser.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Those plantation mistresses just don\u2019t want to go peacefully.", "title": "Decker\u2019s List: 5 Acadiana Ghost Stories", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f51702c525e4fa328243845e2ce9c6550fab4664/c=0-14-123-137&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/LafayetteLA/2014/10/26/chretienpoint.jpg", "creator": "@theadvertiser", "site": "@theadvertiser", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=743844896", "fb": {"app_id": 150147415035780}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc79c\"", "article_summary": "Chretien PointAn 1830s-vintage plantation, Chretien Point was a 3,000-acre cotton producer.\nHer husband died young, but Felicit\u00e9 carried on.\nThe ghost here is an amputee who was never properly discharged.\nFormer Daily Advertiser staffer Jim Bradshaw wrote that people sometimes see an apparition on the anniversary of the girl\u2019s death.\nThe mistress of the plantation was Felicit\u00e9 Chretien, who worked like a man and joined her husband and his friends for cigars and poker in the 12-room mansion."}
