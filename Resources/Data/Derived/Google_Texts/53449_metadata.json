But the bottom line was there was about 8,000 great hockey fans that showed up every night. We just needed to be a .500 hockey club and it would have been here forever. But times change, things change and it\u2019s great to have a chance to come back after all these years.\u201d\n\nBeck was 22 and considered a cornerstone in only his third season when the Rockies traded him to the New York Rangers for a care package of six players. At the time, he was having a home built near Evergreen.\n\n\u201cMy life completely changed at that point,\u201d Beck said. \u201cI was really hurt by that. We had a good young team, and I thought we could get a lot accomplished here. It was nice to see when the Avalanche came here they won right away so the fans didn\u2019t have to wait long. But all the Rockies players were proud of that team and thought we were going places.\u201d\n\nEventually, though, that place was New Jersey \u2014 when the franchise became the New Jersey Devils.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "From Rockies to Avalanche, Colorado blends old and new", "title": "From Rockies to Avalanche, Colorado blends old and new", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/24/from-rockies-to-avalanche-colorado-blends-old-and-new/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151024__BN20151025_C1_BNSP25HKNAVSROCKIESp2.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151024__BN20151025_C1_BNSP25HKNAVSROCKIESp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-24T22:24:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T12:01:33+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It was Rocky \u2026 Really Rocky \u2026 Hockey.\nThis might tell you all you need to know about the Rockies: McDonald, Paiement and Beck all were traded away.\nBut the bottom line was there was about 8,000 great hockey fans that showed up every night.\nIt was nice to see when the Avalanche came here they won right away so the fans didn\u2019t have to wait long.\nBut all the Rockies players were proud of that team and thought we were going places.\u201dEventually, though, that place was New Jersey \u2014 when the franchise became the New Jersey Devils."}
