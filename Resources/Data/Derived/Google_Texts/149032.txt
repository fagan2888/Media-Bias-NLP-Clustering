As a registered dietitian, I find it especially concerning that the Iowa State Fair encouraged young, impressionable children to compete in a bacon-eating contest.

Just one serving of bacon a day raises colorectal cancer risk by 21 percent, making this a contest no one will win.

Why not highlight the broccoli, blueberries, asparagus and corn, which are all in season in Iowa right now? If we focus on these foods, we can encourage healthy behavior in our kids from the start. By moving the bacon off our plates — and out of the competitions — we’ll all earn blue ribbons.
