Obama\u2019s signature bill isn\u2019t doing too hot, but I\u2019m sure you already knew that.\n\nToday, The Heritage Foundation\u2018s Ericka Andersen hosted a Google+ Hangout (pretty cool, right?) with Congressman Roger Williams, Heartland Senior Fellow Ben Domenech, Bryan Broadcasting Vice President Ben Downs, Heritage Research Associate Alyene Senger, and Elizabeth Harrington, staff writer at the Washington Free Beacon. The topic? You guessed it, Obamacare.\n\nSince the bill was passed, 19 of its provisions have been amended, repealed or delayed and lawmakers are scrambling to slow its destruction. Congressman Williams even said it\u2019s \u201cthe worst bill that we\u2019ve seen in our lifetime.\u201d So, why is it so terrible?\n\nFor starters, Downs describes his perspective as a small business owner. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on over here,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t plan for the future when we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d or how much their premiums will increase, which he estimates to be around 25%. Senger reminds us it\u2019s important to realize that people in the individual market aren\u2019t the only ones losing their health plans.\n\nOkay, so maybe Republicans don\u2019t like Obamacare, but they never liked it in the first place. The rest of America probably likes it\u2026 Nope.\n\nDomenech discusses some recent polls that indicate a spike in the number of people who mistrust government\u2019s role in health care, a spike in the number of people who favor a delay in Obamacare and a spike in the number of democrats and independents who favor a delay. It\u2019s not just Republicans; Americans are figuring out that Obamacare is bad for America. A recent Fox News poll revealed that 53% of Americans favor a full repeal of the bill and 54% wish it never passed. This is not good news for Obama\u2019s pet legislation.\n\nDespite the bill\u2019s disaster, the launch of the marketplace website- as we all know- was a disaster as well. Harrington explained that there were no security measures built into to the website, and even with the continuous \u201cfixes\u201d, still has no security. Cyber security expert David Kennedy advised Americans to not even go on the website because of the weak security, and after the November 30 \u201cfixes\u201d, stated that the security problems were even worse. Oh boy.\n\nIt seems as though the Heritage panel is infuriated by all of this mess, and with good reason. We should all be upset too. Promises were made and not kept, our government misled us.\n\nWatch the rest of the video above to hear more about the \u201cUn-Affordable\u201d Care Act and what may be a beacon of hope for the future.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2013/12/america-under-obamacare-the-reality-revealed/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ObamacareBumperSticker_1302.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "America Under Obamacare: The Reality Revealed"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on over here,\u201d he explained.\nIt\u2019s not just Republicans; Americans are figuring out that Obamacare is bad for America.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t plan for the future when we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d or how much their premiums will increase, which he estimates to be around 25%.\nOkay, so maybe Republicans don\u2019t like Obamacare, but they never liked it in the first place.\nA recent Fox News poll revealed that 53% of Americans favor a full repeal of the bill and 54% wish it never passed."}
