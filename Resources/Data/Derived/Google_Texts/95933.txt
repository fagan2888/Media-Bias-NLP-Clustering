It is Cedar Pollen time again!

One pollen that I am very sensitive to - as are many Oklahomans - is Mountain Cedar pollen. It is found in central Texas and also in the Arbuckle mountains.

Station 1 in OKC, which we usually get the daily pollen report from, has not been in operation since September. Oklahoma City's Station 2 is available, and it is found here.



The eastern red cedar pollen, which actually comes from the Juniper family not Cedar, is about to be unleashed, and it typically starts its wrath in February and peaks in March.
