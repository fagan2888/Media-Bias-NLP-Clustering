Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser\n\n-Iowa Pro-life Activist Christine Hurley\n\n-Concerned Women for America Founder and Chairman Beverly LaHaye\n\n-Former Congresswoman and Susan B. Anthony List VP of Government Affairs Marilyn Musgrave\n\n-Concerned Women for America President and CEO Penny Nance\n\n-Urbancure Founder and President Star Parker\n\n-Operation Outcry Iowa Leader Luana Stoltenberg,\n\nThe letter:\n\nDear Iowans,\n\n\n\nAs pro-life women leaders from Iowa and across the nation, we urge Republican caucus-goers and voters to support anyone but Donald Trump. On the issue of defending unborn children and protecting women from the violence of abortion, Mr. Trump cannot be trusted and there is, thankfully, an abundance of alternative candidates with proven records of pro-life leadership whom pro-life voters can support. We have come to this conclusion after having listened patiently to numerous debates and news reports, but most importantly to Donald Trump\u2019s own words.\n\n\n\nThe next president will be responsible for as many as four nominations to the Supreme Court. Mr. Trump has given us only one indication about the type of judges he would appoint, and it does not bode well for those who would like to see the court overturn Roe v. Wade. Mr. Trump has said his sister, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, who struck down the Partial Birth Abortion Ban in New Jersey, would be a \u201cphenomenal\u201d choice for the court. Earlier this month, Mr. Trump also said he thought pro-choice Senator Scott Brown would make a \u201cvery good\u201d Vice President. If one truly believes, as we do, that abortion is the taking of an innocent human life and is committed to the pro-life priorities of ending abortion after five months, and defunding the nation\u2019s largest abortion business, Planned Parenthood, it would be a disaster to have a vice president who disagrees.\n\n\n\nMoreover, as women, we are disgusted by Mr. Trump\u2019s treatment of individuals, women, in particular. He has impugned the dignity of women, most notably Megyn Kelly, he mocked and bullied Carly Fiorina, and has through the years made disparaging public comments to and about many women. Further, Mr. Trump has profited from the exploitation of women in his Atlantic City casino hotel which boasted of the first strip club casino in the country.\n\n\n\nAmerica will only be a great nation when we have leaders of strong character who will defend both unborn children and the dignity of women. We cannot trust Donald Trump to do either. Therefore we urge our fellow citizens to support an alternative candidate.\n\n\n\nTrump is currently neck-in-neck with pro-life candidate Ted Cruz in the Hawkeye State.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Support anyone but Trump.\" .05/26/2016 20:46:51PM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "\"Support anyone but Trump.\"", "title": "Pro-Life leaders just sent this letter to Iowa about Donald Trump and it's brutal", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2016/01/26/major-prolife-leaders-send-message-to-iowa-donald-trump-is-unacceptable-n2110342", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/18/2016-01-18T201814Z_1_LYNXNPEC0H10T_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "\"Support anyone but Trump.\"", "title": "Pro-Life leaders just sent this letter to Iowa about Donald Trump and it's brutal", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2016/01/26/major-prolife-leaders-send-message-to-iowa-donald-trump-is-unacceptable-n2110342", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/18/2016-01-18T201814Z_1_LYNXNPEC0H10T_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "In Scathing Open Letter, Pro-Life Leaders Urge Iowa: Support Anyone But \"Unacceptable\" Donald Trump, Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Some of the country's most respected and committed pro-life leaders have written a scathing, open letter to Iowa voters warning about Donald Trump's long-held pro-choice record just one week before voters head to caucus.\nWe have come to this conclusion after having listened patiently to numerous debates and news reports, but most importantly to Donald Trump\u2019s own words.\nEarlier this month, Mr. Trump also said he thought pro-choice Senator Scott Brown would make a \u201cvery good\u201d Vice President.\nWe cannot trust Donald Trump to do either.\nMoreover, as women, we are disgusted by Mr. Trump\u2019s treatment of individuals, women, in particular."}
