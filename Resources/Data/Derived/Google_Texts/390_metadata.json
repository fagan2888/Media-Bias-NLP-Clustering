Why liberals are abandoning Obamacare employer mandate\n\nRobert Gibbs\u2019 prediction that Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate would \u2014 and perhaps should \u2014 be jettisoned shocked Democrats back in April.\n\nBy July, the former aide and longtime confidant of President Barack Obama had a lot more company. More and more liberal activists and policy experts who help shape Democratic thinking on health care have concluded that penalizing businesses if they don\u2019t offer health insurance is an unnecessary element of the Affordable Care Act that may do more harm than good. Among them are experts at the Urban Institute and the Commonwealth Fund and prominent academics like legal scholar Tim Jost.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe employer mandate, Jost wrote in a Health Affairs post in June, \u201ccries out for repair.\u201d Repealing it \u201cmight not be such a bad idea,\u201d if it\u2019s replaced with something better for workers and businesses.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Jobs report better than expected)\n\nLeading Democrats in Congress aren\u2019t bolting from the employer mandate, at least not before the November election. But the White House has delayed it twice in the past year, dubbed it \u201cnot critical\u201d and said it will be phased in more slowly when its begins next year.\n\nThe rule that businesses with more than 50 full-time workers offer them affordable health insurance has been a political headache from the start. The nonstop stream of headlines, however anecdotal, about businesses cutting jobs or shortening workweeks to skirt the coverage rules has constantly inflamed opposition to Obamacare.\n\nChris Jennings, a longtime health policy hand who helped the White House during the final implementation push, says the employer mandate has become a \u201cpolitical irritant\u201d \u2014 although he didn\u2019t take a stance on whether it should stay, go or be replaced with some other Democrat-blessed way of helping cover workers.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Reforming the VA one step at a time)\n\n\u201cThe issue really becomes, \u2018Do we need it or do we not need it?\u2019\u201d Jennings said. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated to enforce; it is somewhat burdensome to some employers. But it does contribute to the underlying financing of the law.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, of course, have always hated the employer mandate. In different times, that could make it a prime target for a bipartisan overhaul. But as with all things Obamacare, election-year politics gum up the gears. Democrats are promising to improve Obamacare, Republicans are vowing to kill it, and neither party wants to let the other score a health care point before Election Day \u2014 even when they both find fault with the employer mandate.\n\n\u201cVery few problems are in danger of being solved before the election,\u201d Gibbs said in a recent phone interview. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can wipe away the idea that employers are going to have to contribute. I think there are just far less onerous [ways] \u2026 to do something like that.\u201d\n\nDemocrats remain committed to the individual mandate \u2014 the core of the coverage expansion through the new Obamacare markets. And they aren\u2019t tossing specific benefit requirements either, like the controversial birth control coverage rule that was just curtailed by the Supreme Court in the Hobby Lobby religious freedom case.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: New twist in Common Core wars)\n\nGibbs predicted that political leaders will start talking more about changes to the employer mandate in the fall but that a solution will have to wait until 2015.\n\nOther health law supporters agree that\u2019s likely.\n\n\u201cWe just have a situation where everybody\u2019s stuck. Everybody\u2019s afraid of the election,\u201d said Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University. A prominent supporter of the health law, Jost has outlined several replacement ideas to help insure low-income workers.\n\nRepublicans and business groups have bludgeoned the employer mandate. They say it\u2019s a job killer, that it\u2019s a reason for the slow pace of the economic recovery and that compliance requires businesses to cope with a mountain of paperwork and intricate rules. Strategists say that getting rid of it would be a priority in a GOP-led Senate.\n\nBut scrapping it isn\u2019t a snap for Democrats. The employer coverage rules were part of the ACA\u2019s core philosophy that individuals, employers and the government should all contribute to paying health care costs. Some Democratic constituencies, including labor unions and Obamacare proponents like Families USA, still see it that way.\n\nBut the shift among liberal policy experts and advocates has been rapid. A stream of studies and statements have deemed the mandate only moderately useful for getting more people covered under Obamacare. And they too have come to see it as clumsy, a regulatory and financial burden that creates as many problems as it solves.\n\nThe main downside to eliminating the mandate, from the Democratic perspective? Money.\n\nEstimates of the mandate\u2019s worth to Obamacare financing range from $46 billion to more than $100 billion over a decade. That helps pay for coverage expansion. Getting a bipartisan deal to scrap the policy is one hurdle; an agreement on how to make up the money could be even harder.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Tim Jost says repealing it might not be a bad idea, if it\u2019s replaced with a better option for workers.", "title": "Why liberals are abandoning Obamacare employer mandate", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/obamacare-employer-mandate-108578.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/11/20/obamacare_compy_328_ap.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Elections,Barack Obama,Money,Democrats,Health Care,2014 Elections,Politics,Affordable Care Act", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Tim Jost says repealing it might not be a bad idea, if it\u2019s replaced with a better option for workers.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Why liberals are abandoning Obamacare employer mandateRobert Gibbs\u2019 prediction that Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate would \u2014 and perhaps should \u2014 be jettisoned shocked Democrats back in April.\nBut it does contribute to the underlying financing of the law.\u201dRepublicans, of course, have always hated the employer mandate.\nRepublicans and business groups have bludgeoned the employer mandate.\n( Also on POLITICO: Jobs report better than expected)Leading Democrats in Congress aren\u2019t bolting from the employer mandate, at least not before the November election.\n( Also on POLITICO: New twist in Common Core wars)Gibbs predicted that political leaders will start talking more about changes to the employer mandate in the fall but that a solution will have to wait until 2015."}
