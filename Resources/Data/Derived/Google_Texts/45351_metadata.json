This week\u2019s scandal is the broken-glass-gang-rape-that-apparently-wasn\u2019t at the University of Virginia. Initially published with all the indignation that Rolling Stone and its reporter, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, could muster, the magazine has now backpedalled and apologized for its appalling breaches of journalistic protocol.\n\nReferring to it as \u201cthis week\u2019s scandal\u201d is no mere rhetorical flourish. Instances of left-wing journalists, pundits, media personalities, and policymakers making up stories out of whole cloth are flying thick and fast these days. Feminists\u2019 darling du jour Lena Dunham is under fire for the allegations of rape she made in her latest book, \u201cNot That Kind of Girl,\u201d against a fellow former Oberlin student identified only as a \u201ccampus Republican\u201d named \u201cBarry.\u201d \u201cBarry\u201d has retained an attorney and demanded a retraction. After a long and conspicuous silence, Dunham\u2019s publisher, Random House, has agreed to pay \u201cBarry\u2019s\u201d legal fees \u2014 if he\u2019ll donate the money to a rape crisis charity of his choice. At this writing, \u201cBarry,\u201d continuing to maintain his innocence, has refused the offer.\n\nJust last month, \u201cGrubered\u201d was added to the popular lexicon when MIT professor and Obamacare guru Jonathan Gruber admitted no fewer than seven times (on camera, anyway) that the law\u2019s drafters had deliberately lied about key aspects of the legislation. To add insult \u2014 literally \u2014 to injury, Gruber credited the law\u2019s passage to American voters\u2019 \u201cstupidity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nAnd then there is Ferguson, Missouri, shooting victim Michael Brown. Despite evidence from multiple witnesses that Brown was assaulting the police officer who shot him, the meme that has taken hold depicts Brown yelling, \u201cDon\u2019t shoot!\u201d with his hands up.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a recent phenomenon, and it\u2019s no accident. Progressives thrive on creating stories that are nothing more than prog-paganda \u2014 \u201ccases\u201d that justify their political agenda. Deliberate falsehoods are created to whip the public into a fervor for some initiative. By the time the lie is exposed, it\u2019s too late.\n\nNARAL founder and former abortionist-turned-pro-life activist Dr. Bernard Nathanson admitted that the oft-quoted figure of 10,000 women dying from botched abortions every year was a complete fabrication, used to drum up support for abortion on demand.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nTwenty-two years ago, Guatamalan peasant activist Rigoberta Menchu received the Nobel Peace Prize for her autobiography, \u201cI, Rigoberta Menchu.\u201d But when an admiring scholar followed up on the facts alleged in her book, he discovered that significant parts of the most compelling accounts were utter fiction. In what has become the standard prog-paganda line, the Chronicle of Higher Education wrote, \u201c(I)t doesn\u2019t matter if the facts in the book are wrong, because \u2026 Ms. Menchu\u2019s story speaks to a greater truth about the oppression of poor people in Central America.\u201d\n\nYou see? It\u2019s not the facts that matter; it\u2019s the larger narrative. And virtually every cause the left cares about has been transformed into a Blob-like \u201clarger narrative\u201d that survives by consuming inconvenient facts to the contrary:\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that the science shows no global warming over the past 15 years. What matters is the larger narrative about human exploitation of the planet\u2019s natural resources.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that the young men at Duke did not rape exotic dancer Crystal Mangum. What matters is the larger narrative of white privilege and the athletic culture at Duke.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that Matthew Shepard\u2019s brutal beating and death were likely a drug deal gone bad \u2014 and at the hands of a former male lover. What matters is the larger narrative about homophobia.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that most men don\u2019t rape, or that (contrary to popular belief) 1 in 5 women aren\u2019t actually sexually assaulted on college campuses. What matters is the larger narrative about male patriarchy.\n\nIn short, for progressives, truth takes a back seat to a political agenda, even \u2014 no, especially \u2014 when the truth reveals that their political agenda is empty, specious, corrupt, and unjustified. Most disturbingly, the media \u2014 charged with the responsibility of finding and exposing the truth \u2014 plays along.\n\nAnd they wonder why Americans no longer trust the press?\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2014 CREATORS.COM\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by the owners of this website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "...truth takes a back seat to a political agenda...", "author": "Laura Hollis", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "...truth takes a back seat to a political agenda...", "title": "For Progressives, The \"Narrative\" Is More Important Than The Truth", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1252, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/progressives4.png", "height": 694}, "updated_time": "2014-12-10T18:08:27-07:00", "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/progressives-narrative-important-truth/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "...truth takes a back seat to a political agenda...", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/progressives4.png", "title": "For Progressives, The \"Narrative\" Is More Important Than The Truth", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2014-12-11T09:42:08-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Opinion", "tag": "Progressive", "published_time": "2014-12-11T09:42:08-07:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-10T18:08:27-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "progressive agenda, liberal agenda, narrative is important, uva scandal, uva rape, rolling stone uva, lena dunham, lena dunham lied, rigoberta menchu, mainstream media, progressive, politics, nation, religion"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccea9\"", "article_summary": "In short, for progressives, truth takes a back seat to a political agenda, even \u2014 no, especially \u2014 when the truth reveals that their political agenda is empty, specious, corrupt, and unjustified.\nWhat matters is the larger narrative of white privilege and the athletic culture at Duke.\nWhat matters is the larger narrative about human exploitation of the planet\u2019s natural resources.\nIt\u2019s not the facts that matter; it\u2019s the larger narrative.\nWhat matters is the larger narrative about male patriarchy."}
