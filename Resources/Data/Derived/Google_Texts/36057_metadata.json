He had already shot half a dozen in a neighboring area (all of whom survived). He saw a black man walking with his family and decided that was good enough. He shot him\u2013and Ricky Byrdsong, former Northwestern University basketball coach, died. The killer led an interstate manhunt, during which he killed a Korean man outside a church before shooting himself.\n\nThe murderer was a troubled white kid from a privileged background. He was also part of a racist hate group. He bought his gun illegally.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThere were lots of things said about racism and gun control, including a regrettable comment blaming President Bill Clinton for Byrdsong\u2019s death because the killer had not been prosecuted for violating firearms laws.\n\nAs in many of these cases, people jumped on the terrible event with their own agendas, their own broader lessons to be drawn.\n\nI can understand that. I\u2019ve been there. I know it may be motivated by the best of intentions, and genuine sorrow.\n\nBut I remember as I looked at the street corner where Ricky Byrdsong fell, that none of that was on my mind. All I felt was the anguish of knowing that bigotry persisted even in the midst of our wonderful country\u2013and yet we had all come together, as we always do, to celebrate the Fourth of July.\n\nIt was painful and confusing. What more was there to say?\n\nWe hear the president talk gun control\u2013so soon after the Charleston shooting, when no law he has proposed would have stopped it. We see the left blaming the Confederate flag, when the majority of South Carolinans elected an Indian-American governor and a black U.S. Senator. We watch Jon Stewart tell us America is \u201csteeped in\u201d racism.\n\nIt\u2019s false. It\u2019s divisive. As Stewart himself once said: Stop hurting America.\n\nYes, hate exists. But there is so much more love. Isn\u2019t it time to come together?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Yes, Racism Exists, Jon Stewart.
