The list includes some leading academic medical centers, such as the Cleveland Clinic, and 21 hospitals in Michigan.\n\nRelated: Invisible threats - MLive series on hospital-acquired infections\n\n\u2022 Metro Health receives top grade in 'Safer Surgery' guide\n\nUnder a provision of the Affordable Care Act, Medicare reductions are required for the hospitals that rank in the top quarter on a Hospital Acquired Condition score.\n\nDr. Michael Kramer, Spectrum\u2019s vice president for system quality and safety, cited a couple of reasons Butterworth made the list.\n\n\u201cWe are very conscientious about reporting things that CMS and the federal government consider a complication,\u201d he said.\n\nButterworth performed worse than the national benchmark in catheter-associated urinary tract infections, for example.\n\n\u201cWe are very diligent in reporting any sign of infection, even those things that would not cause harm to the patient,\u201d Kramer said.\n\nDr. Darrel Campbell, chief medical officer for the University of Michigan Health System, echoed that concern in a report by Kaiser Health News. The hospital is not among those penalized but has a higher rate of catheter-associated infections.\n\n\u201cHow hard you look for something influences your results,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, Kramer said Butterworth handles patients with more complex medical conditions than many hospitals. Although infection rates are adjusted for differing levels of patient sickness and vulnerability, the adjustments don\u2019t go far enough, he said.\n\n\u201cIn the way in which it is reported, we are compared to all hospitals with intensive care units,\u201d he said.\n\nAcademic medical centers also complained the adjustment did not account for the complexity of their caseloads. A Kaiser Health analysis showed 143 of 292 major teaching hospitals were penalized.\n\nHowever, Kramer said he welcomed the increased federal emphasis on patient safety.\n\n\u201cWe make a huge investment in quality and safety and avoiding hospital-acquired infections,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really are appreciative that the national dialogue has risen to this level of visibility.\u201d\n\nEvery patient has a bedside chart showing how many days the patient has had a catheter, for example, as a step toward reducing the use of catheters and lowering infection risk. Spectrum has become a national leader in promoting hand-washing.\n\nThe Hospital Acquired Condition scores used to determine the penalties were based on three factors \u2013 infections associated with central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI), catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), and a patient safety rating assessed to each hospital.\n\nEach hospital was assessed a score on a 10-point scale. Penalties were imposed on those with a total score of 7 or higher.\n\nSpectrum\u2019s score was 9.025. Mercy Health Saint Mary\u2019s scored 6.75. Metro Health Hospital scored 5.425.\n\nThe data was reported in 2012 and 2013. Kramer said it does reflect improvements since then. Last month, the hospital had just one central line-associated infection.\n\n\u201cWe are making great progress,\u201d he said. \u201cOur goal is to get to zero in all of these.\u201d\n\nBelow is the list of other Michigan hospitals that were penalized, according to Kaiser Health News:\n\n\u2022 Borgess Medical Center, Kalamazoo\n\n\u2022 Bronson Battle Creek Hospital, Battle Creek\n\n\u2022 Carson City Hospital, Carson City\n\n\u2022 Crittenton Hospital Medical Center, Rochester\n\n\u2022 Detroit Receiving Hospital, Detroit\n\n\u2022 Forest Health Medical Center, Ypsilanti\n\n\u2022 Genesys Regional Medical Center - Health Park, Grand Blanc\n\n\u2022 Harper University Hospital, Detroit\n\n\u2022 Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit\n\n\u2022 Henry Ford Macomb Hospital, Clinton Township\n\n\u2022 Hurley Medical Center, Flint\n\n\u2022 Mclaren - Greater Lansing\n\n\u2022 Mclaren Flint\n\n\u2022 Mclaren Macomb Hospital, Mount Clemens\n\n\u2022 Mercy Memorial Hospital System, Monroe\n\n\u2022 Oakwood Hospital - Southshore, Trenton\n\n\u2022 Oakwood Hospital And Medical Center, Dearborn\n\n\u2022 Portage Health, Hancock\n\n\u2022 St Joseph Mercy Port Huron\n\n\u2022 William Beaumont Hospital-Grosse Pointe\n\n\n\nSue Thoms covers health care for MLive/The Grand Rapids Press.
