After a sleepless night, I learned that I could choose from a Gold, Silver, or Bronze plan (HMO or PPO) being offered by Blue Cross Blue Shield. As my doctor doesn't accept HMO plans, my best choice would probably be the Bronze or Gold PPO. However, my premiums and out-of-pocket costs are INCREASING $4,500-$6,500 per year. What happened to saving $2,500 per year as purported by the current administration? Also, these rates include a 10-percent federal tax ... so much for "no new taxes!"

Small-business owner: Insurance canceled: A message to President Obama

Retired executive: I can keep my health insurance? Not true!

My current insurance premium is not cheap ($648.42/month with a $1,500 deductible); but, I have a cap that has kept my rates steady for the last 6 years. The new plans are confusing with deductibles, co-insurances, and out-of-pocket costs ranging from $5,100 to $6,350 per year with NO premium rate caps. My annual bottom line costs will be about $12,500 to $16,500, with no caps and will probably increase the following year(s)...This is insanity!

So, what I am getting under these new policies? Nothing, as far as I'm concerned, unless you count maternity care, pediatric vision, etc. I chose my own plan, which has served me very well. My husband is a saint: He is 72 (on Medicare with a private supplemental) and working full time to make sure I receive the necessary medical care.



I was working full time as a registered nurse when I became seriously ill with cancer. To make matters worse, I'm not eligible to receive any Social Security disability as I was a few work credits short ... so much for government assistance! I keep praying that my health will improve so I can work part time as an RN or find other employment that will help pay for my increased costs.
