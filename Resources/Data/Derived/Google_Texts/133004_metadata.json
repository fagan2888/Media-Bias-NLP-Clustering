We\u2019re feeling like this is a way to highlight that issue.\"\n\nBrueggemann says he\u2019s not worried about the financial hit his bakery will take with the loss in revenue for the day.\n\n\u201cIn terms of highlighting the issue, I think it\u2019s a relatively inexpensive way to do that. It\u2019s kind of a clever way, I think,\u201d he said. \u201cIt brings it right to the fore in a way just the statistic does not.\u201d\n\nSome have challenged the 79-cents-on-the-dollar figure, but Brueggemann says that\u2019s splitting hairs over an important issue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a figure where you can come to a slightly different percentage, but I don\u2019t think anyone has argued that there is parity between men and women.\u201d\n\nAnd Brueggemann says The Works practices what it preaches.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely we do,\u201d he said. \u201cI would be willing to show people that it is what we do.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "Business", "description": "A New Hampshire-based bakery chain is showing its support for Equal Pay Day Tuesday by giving female customers a break on their bills.
