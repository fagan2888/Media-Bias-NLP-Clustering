× Navy ship christened in honor of fallen Marine from San Diego

SAN DIEGO – The military christened a new U.S. warship named in honor of a Marine from San Diego who was killed in Iraq.

In a ceremony in English and Spanish, the Navy guided-missile destroyer Rafael Peralta was christened in Bath, Maine, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Peralta was killed Nov. 15, 2004, during the second battle of Fallouja and is credited with saving the lives of several Marines during house-to-house fighting. He was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross, although Marines insist he should have received the Medal of Honor.

Peralta’s mother, Rosa, the ship’s sponsor, asked God to bless the ship and keep its crew safe.
