But in a drive to find savings to social care budgets, they must not pass the burden of this \u2018secret subsidy\u2019 on to the families of poorer pensioners.\n\n\u201cIt is only poorer pensioners who qualify for a local authority funded care home place, and yet it is their families that are being asked to make up the shortfall in care budgets. We hear all the time from families who are willing to do anything they can to ensure their elderly relatives get decent care, even if they\u2019re struggling financially themselves. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that there are rules to make sure they do not feel pressured into paying fees unnecessarily.\n\n\u201cTop-up fees must always be optional, affordable and transparent. The rules introduced by the Government should ensure that is the case. So it is very worrying that so many councils are still failing to follow these basic principles.\u201d\n\nCouncils not complying with Care Act\n\nIndependent Age found that for the period April to June 2015, 43 per cent (53 out of 122 councils who responded) did not comply with at least one of the requirements stipulated in the Care Act which came into force in April 2015 to:\n\n\u2022 have a written agreement in place for all top-up fee arrangements in their area\n\n\u2022 carry out annual reviews of top-up agreements as a matter of course\n\n\u2022 ensure all top-ups in their area were arranged with the involvement of the local authority\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that almost 50,000 older people in England have a \u2018top-up\u2019 paid towards their care costs by a relative, ranging from tens to hundreds of pounds every week.\n\nThe new findings come as social care budgets are under pressure as never before. The Association of Directors of Adult Social Services estimate that councils have faced reductions of \u00a34.6bn to adult social care budgets since 2009-10 \u2013 almost a third of net real terms spend. And while local councils on average pay \u00a3512 a week towards a care home place, analysts estimate that the real cost is between \u00a3554 and \u00a3625 a week.\n\nJanet Morrison, chief executive of Independent Age, said: \u201cThe findings do suggest that there has been some progress since the introduction of the Care Act. A total of 48 per cent (58 out of 122) of local authorities have written agreements in place for all top-up fees entered into since April 2015. Whereas in 2013, only 28 per cent even had information about all top-up fees in their area, according to previous research by Independent Age.\u201d\n\nLocal Government Ombudsman warns councils\n\nThis week, the Local Government Ombudsman warned councils that they must offer affordable care options when arranging care homes following the case of a family that was wrongly left to pay top-up fees for three years.\n\nThe Local Government Ombudsman (LGO) said Solihull Council had provided \u2018insufficient information\u2019 to the family when they were attempting to organise care for their father.\n\nThe council had contacted 13 nursing homes but only found one that would accept its standard rate. This home did not have any vacancies. \u2018When the council decided the man needed to live permanently in a nursing home it again failed to help the family find a home that did not require a top-up,\u2019 said the LGO\u2019s report.\n\nThe family were forced to continue to pay the top-up fees even when they later told the council they were struggling to afford the payments. The council has since offered to refund the top-up paid by the family up to when their father went in to permanent care in October 2007 but does not accept responsibility for payments made after that date.\n\nDr Jane Martin, Local Government Ombudsman, said: \u201cWhen arranging care, councils must offer families an affordable alternative to a placement which requires a top-up fee. If no placements are available in their area that do not require a top-up then councils must fund the top-up themselves.\n\n\u201cIn this case, no affordable placement was offered and the family was not made aware that such an alternative should have been available to them.\n\n\u201cI would urge Solihull Council to act upon my recommendations and consider the lessons from our focus report.\u201d\n\nclick here for more details or to contact Independent Age", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "'Too many care homes' charging pensioners' families for care that should be free", "og": {"image": "http://www.carehome.co.uk/article_photos/1573403.jpg"}, "news_keywords": "top-up fees, local authorities, councils, independent age, families, local government ombudsman", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "'Too many care homes' charging pensioners' families for care that should be free"}, "article_summary": "Families making up the shortfall in care budgets\u201cToo many care homes are charging pensioners\u2019 families for care that should be free, and too many councils have been turning a blind eye to the practice,\u201d said Janet Morrison, chief executive of Independent Age.\nBut in a drive to find savings to social care budgets, they must not pass the burden of this \u2018secret subsidy\u2019 on to the families of poorer pensioners.\nThe new findings come as social care budgets are under pressure as never before.\nA charity has called for top-up fees to be \u2018optional, affordable and transparent\u2019, after finding many families are subsidising the cost of their relative\u2019s care home when it should be free.\nDr Jane Martin, Local Government Ombudsman, said: \u201cWhen arranging care, councils must offer families an affordable alternative to a placement which requires a top-up fee."}
