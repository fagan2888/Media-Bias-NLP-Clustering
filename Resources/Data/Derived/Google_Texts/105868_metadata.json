It shows you how this contract can affect so many people.\u201d\n\nTodd Barbiaux, Local 1196's vice president, counted 665 people and said more were standing in the hall outside the auditorium. He said the balcony was opened to accommodate the crowd but there were still more than 100 people standing along the walls.\n\n\u201cIt was really undivided attention,\u201d he said. \u201cYou couldn't hear people breathing, that's how quiet it was.\u201d\n\nNegotiations are dormant since the union and ATI last week agreed to keep working under terms of the previous contract, which expired July 1.\n\nAccording to the union, the company issued a proposal seeking 140-plus items on contract language, many of which the union claims will adversely affect hours, wages, working conditions and benefits for its members.\n\nThe company has refused to comment on the negotiations.\n\nLocal 1196 in Brackenridge is one of two locals that represent about 1,100 local workers at ATI specialty steel plants in Harrison, Gilpin and Vandergrift.\n\nAlthough the negotiations will affect 2,500 workers overall at 11 ATI Flat-rolled Products plants in four states, the retirees also have a big stake in them: health insurance.\n\nThat was on the minds of many retirees entering and leaving the meeting, which was closed to the public and lasted nearly two hours.\n\n\u201cI'm afraid it is getting to the point where it is going to be too expensive,\u201d Tom Cichello, 69, of Harrison.\n\nCichello worked at the Harrison mill for 30 years before retiring in 1999. He said he has had his share of health problems, which makes coverage essential. But the increases in what retirees pay monthly from the last two contracts have made for a more difficult financial situation.\n\n\u201cIt changes it a lot,\u201d Cichello said. \u201cEverything goes up \u2014 I never knew what a fixed income really meant until I retired.\u201d\n\nCichello said ATI deducts the premiums out of his pension check. He has a job now to help keep up and is considering getting a second job.\n\n\u201cSad, isn't it?\u201d he said.\n\nTom Burkett, 83, of New Kensington worked 44 years in the mill before he retired in 1994. He's also worried about a possible increase in health care premiums.\n\n\u201cIt was $30 (per family member) and now it's $100,\u201d Burkett said. \u201cWe're getting along, but we aren't getting a\n\ncost-of-living increase from the mill, and everything keeps going up.\u201d\n\nRetirees don't get to vote on approving contracts, which falls to active union members.\n\nThat bothers Eugene Symionof, 73, of Upper Burrell. Symionof, who has been retired for 11 years, also is concerned about health insurance premiums.\n\n\u201cThey could raise our health care by $200, and we have no say so in it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is the first thing they go after, health care,\u201d said Tony Slomkoski, president of Steelworkers Organization of Active Retirees (SOAR) for Local 1196. \u201cI'm just hoping we can hold onto the status quo.\u201d\n\nArabia said he was honest and straightforward with the retirees in regard to their concerns and the negotiations.\n\n\u201cWe don't know what's going to happen, but I'm not going to tell them everything is hunky-dory,\u201d Arabia said.\n\nHe said he told the retirees that the union the leadership would fight for them.\n\nAlan Brzezinski, president of SOAR at the other ATI local, Local 1138 in Leechburg, is convinced of that.\n\n\u201cWe're behind our union leaders 100 percent,\u201d Brzezinski said. \u201cThey have our best interests in mind. They are fighting to keep (health care premiums) down.\u201d\n\nAll of the retirees interviewed applauded Arabia for keeping the retirees informed. That included Larry Gezo, 62, of Lower Burrell who retired in 2009.\n\n\u201cI'm glad they did it,\u201d Gezo said. \u201cIt was nice that they thought of the retirees.\u201d\n\nHe also thinks it will go a long way to bringing the retirees and the active members together.\n\nArabia said that's good to hear \u2014 since the last two contracts pitted the interests of active members against those of the retirees and created animosity.\n\nJack Richards, a former Harrison resident and an ATI retiree, said, \u201cI believe that if we want our benefits to continue, the retirees have to support the guys who are working.\u201d\n\nTom Yerace is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
