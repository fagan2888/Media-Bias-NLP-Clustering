Writing for the July 7, 2014 issue of The New American, William F. Jasper discusses the Surgery Center of Oklahoma. He quotes several patients who have had procedures done at SCO, "testimonials are found on the website of Samaritan Ministries, a Christian healthcare alternative to insurance that now boasts a membership of more than 35,000 member households."

Jasper writes about the potential of SCO and other physician-owned facilities as an alternative to Obamacare: "As skyrocketing healthcare costs have driven up insurance deductibles and co-payments, many individuals, as well as companies with self-funded health programs, have been looking for alternatives. The federally mandated Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) has accelerated and intensified the search for alternatives."
