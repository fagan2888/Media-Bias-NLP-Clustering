This mega election hosts 12 states\u2019 primaries and caucuses, and while it may sound like a lame spirit day where everyone is supposed to dress up like a superhero, it\u2019s actually a key date during the primaries. Twelve states in one day with 595 delegates at stake equals a lot of votes that Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, John Kasich, and Ben Carson can\u2019t afford to lose. And as Trump is leading in the polls, and has already won big in New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada, the stakes couldn't be higher.\n\nThis explains why Marco Rubio, the junior U.S. senator from Florida, and Ted Cruz, the junior U.S. senator from Texas, ganged up on Trump in a bid to show constituents and party leaders why they should be the party's eventual nominee. From his taxes to whether or not he's a true conservative, Trump fended off attacks on multiple levels. Missed the action? Don't worry, below you'll find the most compelling exchanges about the issues that matter most to you.\n\nHealthcare\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that the Republicans want to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Kasich, the governor of Ohio, wants to take federal resources and combine it with freed-up Medicaid programs in order to cover the working poor currently without health insurance. Carson, a former neurosurgeon, said, \u201cWell, first of all, healthcare is not a right. But I do believe it is a responsibility for a responsible society, and we are that. We spend almost twice as much per capita on healthcare as many other nations who have actually much better access than we do.\u201d When Trump didn\u2019t have a clear outline for his plan, Rubio took on the role of debate moderator and grilled him. \u201cWhat\u2019s your plan?\u201d Rubio asked, multiple times. Finally, Trump replied, \u201cYou get rid of the lines, it brings in competition. So, instead of having one insurance company taking care of New York, or Texas, you'll have many. They'll compete, and it'll be a beautiful thing.\u201d\n\nImmigration\n\nMarco Rubio was called out by Arrass, one of the moderators, for flip-flopping on immigration and recently pledging to end DACA \u2014 which provides protection to immigrants who came to America as children \u2014 on day one in office. \"What changed?\" Arrass asked. \"The problem with the executive order is it is unconstitutional. The president doesn't have the power to do that,\" Rubio responded. \"No matter how sympathetic we may be to a cause, we cannot violate the Constitution of the United States the way this president now does on a regular basis.\" Trump then tried to call out Rubio's change of heart, and said, \"I have to say, he lied this time.\" Cruz, who would also void DACA, said, \"I think we need a president who knows what he believes in.\"\n\nArrass then asked Cruz about criticism that he and Rubio have received about not using their positions as Hispanic candidates to expand the Republican party base instead of pandering to traditional Republican voters by being tough on deportation. Cruz replied, \"I do think it's amazing that on this stage tonight there are two descendants of Cuban origin and an African American. We are the party of diversity, not the Democratic party. And the second point I would make is that we have to move past this idea that somehow the hispanic community only cares about immigration.\u201d\n\nAnd as always, any discussion about immigration with Trump involves his plan to build a wall across our southern border with Mexico.\n\nPlanned Parenthood\n\nBy now, we all know that all of the Republican candidates want to defund Planned Parenthood. Some of them already have. But Trump\u2019s stance on the women's healthcare organization has left us feeling more confused than when we found out \u2014 spoiler alert \u2014 that #CeCeisA. \u201cAs far as Planned Parenthood is concerned, I'm pro-life. I'm totally against abortion, having to do with Planned Parenthood. But millions and millions of women \u2014 cervical cancer, breast cancer \u2014 are helped by Planned Parenthood,\u201d Trump said. For a moment, it seemed like Trump was going to defend funding Planned Parenthood, but then he said, \"So you can say whatever you want, but they have millions of women going through Planned Parenthood that are helped greatly. And I wouldn't fund it.\u201d He later explained that the only reason he would defund Planned Parenthood is because 3% of their health services are abortion services.\n\nAnd on our bodies, Trump also said that he would apply a litmus test to Supreme Court nominees in regards to their views on religious liberty, after a moderator referenced Hobby Lobby, a case about whether employers with religious objections could deny women contraceptives.\n\nForeign Affairs\n\nThe Cruz-Rubio-Trump smackdown continued when Cruz called out Rubio and Trump for supporting Secretary of State John Kerry. Rubio voted to confirm Kerry, \u201cand Donald Trump supported John Kerry against George W. Bush in 2004, gave him a check,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cAnd John Kerry has been the most anti-Israel secretary of State this country has ever seen. His diplomacy has been a disaster. And if we nominate someone who agreed with John Kerry, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on foreign policy, we're not in a strong position to win the general election.\u201d\n\nWell, whatever love Trump might have once had for Kerry is gone now. He said, \"As far as John Kerry is concerned, there has been no tougher critic of this man, I think he negotiated one of the worst deals in the history of our country, the Iran deal... I'm no fan of John Kerry.\"\n\nYour iPhone\n\nEver since whistle blower Edward Snowden exposed the activities of the NSA to the American people, we\u2019ve had the national security versus personal privacy debate on our minds. After the San Bernardino shooting, that debate continues as the F.B.I. and Apple fight over whether the company should help the government hack an iPhone used by one of the shooters. Apple believes assisting the F.B.I. will threaten the security of its customers. The Republican candidates all seem to agree that Apple should work with the F.B.I., however. Rubio said, \u201cWell, let me tell you, their brand [Apple] is not superior to the national security of the United States of America.\u201d\n\nWinner?\n\nWe don\u2019t think anyone got out of this debate unscathed \u2014 not even viewers. But if anyone came out on top, it\u2019s Rubio. From the moment the debate began, we could tell that he was here to take votes away from Trump, and to whittle down Cruz's relevance. On the former, we're not sure if he was successful given Trump's seemingly teflon shield, but on the latter, maybe. We\u2019ll see if his efforts pay off in the next few days when people head out to their polling places on Super Tuesday.\n\nRelated: A Shocking Amount of Donald Trump Supporters Think Ending Slavery Was a Bad Idea", "article_metadata": {"description": "Here's what you missed from the 10th Republican debate, where Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz attacked Donald Trump.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2016", "author": "Ashley Sprouse", "og": {"site_name": "Teen Vogue", "description": "It was the Republicans' final matchup before Super Tuesday.", "title": "How Donald Trump Was Finally Dominated During Last Night's Debate", "url": "http://www.teenvogue.com/story/10th-republican-debate-trump-rubio-cruz", "image": "http://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/56d03ec08e0df32841190b6e/3:2/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/republican-debate-recap.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "teenvogue.com", "description": "It was the Republicans' final matchup before Super Tuesday.", "title": "How Donald Trump Was Finally Dominated During Last Night's Debate", "image": {"src": "http://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/56d03ec08e0df32841190b6e/master/pass/republican-debate-recap.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@teenvogue", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 108943, "app_id": 1013284322017473}, "version": "1.28.0", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "keywords": "Republican Debate,Donald Trump,Marco Rubio,Ted Cruz,2016 Election", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But millions and millions of women \u2014 cervical cancer, breast cancer \u2014 are helped by Planned Parenthood,\u201d Trump said.\nRubio voted to confirm Kerry, \u201cand Donald Trump supported John Kerry against George W.
