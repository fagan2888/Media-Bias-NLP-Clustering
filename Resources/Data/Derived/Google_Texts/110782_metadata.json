A state decision is pending.\n\nLast year, the hospital network narrowed its operating loss to $37 million, down from a $402 million loss the previous year. The 2013 loss was made worse by a one-time non-cash accounting charge of $311 million.\n\n\u201cAllegheny Health Network continues to deliver on its turnaround,\u201d said Karen Hanlon, Highmark Health's chief financial officer.\n\nBeato said the network is making progress on returning to profitability, though he cautioned that success is dependent on Highmark's convincing its members to choose Allegheny Health hospitals over those of rival UPMC, the biggest health system in Western Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cWe're beginning to see that Allegheny Health Network has improved its earnings; however, it's still a very early stage,\u201d he said.\n\nHighmark's diversified insurance businesses, which include for-profit vision, dental and reinsurance subsidiaries, provided a bright spot for the company, reporting operating income of $243 million, up 3 percent from the previous year.\n\n\u201cThe breadth of our diversified businesses is what sets us apart from our competitors,\u201d CEO David Holmberg said.\n\nTotal revenue last year increased 6 percent to $16.8 billion.\n\n\u201cWe remain financially strong and stable, and we are pleased with our top line growth given the increasingly competitive environment we faced last year,\u201d Holmberg said.\n\nAdding in investment gains and other non-operating income, the company posted a net loss of $83 million last year, an improvement over the previous year's net loss of $134 million.\n\nAlex Nixon is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
