Each one has been systematically debunked. So AFP switched gears. In their latest ad, instead of focusing on a single case, they simply make the broad charge that \"millions of people have lost their health insurance, millions of people can\u2019t see their own doctors, and millions are paying more and getting less.\" Take that, meddling fact checkers!\n\nSo Glenn Kessler took a look. Verdict: when you make broad statements, it is indeed harder to demonstrate that they're concretely wrong. After all, some people have lost their health insurance, some people can\u2019t see their own doctors, and some people are paying more and getting less. Nonetheless, Kessler concludes that AFP's broad charges aren't much more defensible than their bogus real Americans.
