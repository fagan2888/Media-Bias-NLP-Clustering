Scott Applewhite\n\nPresident Obama unveiled his annual budget on Monday, touting a number of proposals to put \u201cmore money in middle-class pockets,\u201d including a tax hike on the wealthy and tax credits for working families. Republicans in Congress are likely to scrap most of his proposals. But if the party is sincere about shrinking income inequality \u2014 as prominent politicians have claimed ahead of the 2016 election \u2014 the president\u2019s policies deserve a closer look.\n\n\u201cThe Obamanomics that we\u2019re practicing now have exacerbated inequality,\u201d House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) said in an interview on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. \u201cThey\u2019ve exacerbated stagnation. They\u2019re made things worse.\u201d\n\nRyan\u2019s response to the budget echoes the chorus of conservatives who have asserted that Obama\u2019s policies have created the current income gap. \u201cFrankly, the president\u2019s policies have made income inequality worse,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) said on CBS\u2019s 60 Minutes recently. Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) also said last weekend that \u201cthe reason\u2026 the economy is getting better is despite the president, and despite the president\u2019s policies,\u201d while likely 2016 candidate Jeb Bush noted that \u201cwhile the last eight years have been pretty good ones for top earners, they\u2019ve been a lost decade for the rest of America.\u201d\n\nBut each of the proposals included in Obama\u2019s new budget are actually likely to decrease the gap and help working-class and poor families.\n\nOne of Obama\u2019s major budget proposals would generate $320 billion in taxes over the next ten years by raising the capital gains tax and the tax rate on Americans making more than $500,000 a year. Research has shown that the low capital gains tax rate has been one of the biggest drivers of inequality. The proposal also calls for higher taxes on large financial institutions and a new tax on inheritances.\n\nAs Obama has argued, higher taxes on the wealthy could pay for subsidies and programs to help those on the other end of the wage spectrum. Obama\u2019s earlier tax policy changes are proof of this; the income gap between the rich and the poor narrowed significantly more than under George W. Bush\u2019s tax code. The gap between the rich and the middle class also narrowed, according to a Washington Post and Tax Policy Center analysis.\n\nObama\u2019s new budget also calls for expanded access to the earned income tax credit for workers without children, a $500 second earner tax credit and a $3,000 childcare tax credit. All three of these initiatives would help alleviate the burden of working class individuals and families, no matter what their family structure may be.\n\nThe Treasury Department estimates that those proposals would benefit more than 44 million households with an average benefit of $600 a year \u2013 a crucial amount for a family struggling to pay rent or put food on the table.\n\nThe budget also includes measures to help workers and keep the unemployment rate on the decline, including a 1.3 percent pay raise to military and federal employees \u2014 slightly higher than the raise granted for the last two years. According to the Office of Management and Budget, the unemployment rate should fall to 5.4 percent by the end of the year.\n\nObama\u2019s proposals aim to continue the successful job growth that has occurred during most of his two terms, leading to the largest annual unemployment rate drop in the last 30 years. \u201cAmerican businesses set a new record for the most consecutive months of job growth: 58 straight months and a total of 11.2 million new jobs, and counting,\u201d the budget proposal states.\n\nCREDIT: Office of Management and Budget\n\nOverall, Obama is calling for spending levels seven percent higher than current caps set by sequestration, which has hit poor and vulnerable populations hardest.\n\nObama\u2019s new proposals would likely continue reducing inequality, as his current policies, including the Affordable Care Act and tax increases on the wealthy, have already significantly contributed to the decline.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Obama's proposals would continue to reduce the unemployment rate and help the working class.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Obama's proposals would continue to reduce the unemployment rate and help the working class.", "title": "Republicans Show They Aren\u2019t Really Interested In Reducing Inequality", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2015/02/02/3618169/obamas-budget-inequality/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AP736720943683.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama's proposals would continue to reduce the unemployment rate and help the working class.", "creator": "@Kira_Lerner", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AP736720943683-321x214.jpg", "title": "Republicans Show They Aren\u2019t Really Interested In Reducing Inequality", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-economy", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AP736720943683.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AP736720943683.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-02T13:42:41+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/KiraLerner"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd3ff\"", "article_summary": "Economy Republicans Show They Aren\u2019t Really Interested In Reducing Inequality CREDIT: AP Photo/J.\n\u201cFrankly, the president\u2019s policies have made income inequality worse,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) said on CBS\u2019s 60 Minutes recently.\nResearch has shown that the low capital gains tax rate has been one of the biggest drivers of inequality.\nBut if the party is sincere about shrinking income inequality \u2014 as prominent politicians have claimed ahead of the 2016 election \u2014 the president\u2019s policies deserve a closer look.\nObama\u2019s new proposals would likely continue reducing inequality, as his current policies, including the Affordable Care Act and tax increases on the wealthy, have already significantly contributed to the decline."}
