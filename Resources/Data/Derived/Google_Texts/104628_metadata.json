The five touchdown throws matched a career high \u2014 set earlier this season against Pittsburgh \u2014 and gave him 16 over his last four games.\n\nBaldwin scored on passes of 14, 22 and 16 yards. Tyler Lockett caught TD throws of 8 and 49 yards.\n\n\u201cGuys were making plays all over the field,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cAnd the offensive line is giving me enough time to make those decisions and get the ball out on time.\u201d\n\nSeattle (8-5) played most of the game without standout rookie running back Thomas Rawls, who broke his left ankle in the first quarter and is out for the season. Rawls had already gained 47 yards during the Seahawks\u2019 first drive when he was hurt on a 3-yard loss.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t get any tougher than that,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to miss him, but I thought everybody collectively played a great game.\u201d\n\nRawls was replaced by DuJuan Harris, who ran for 42 yards on 18 carries but lost a fumble. Marshawn Lynch, who sits atop the depth chart, missed a fourth straight game with an abdomen injury.\n\nNo matter. As long as Wilson has time in the pocket \u2014 and he sure did Sunday \u2014 the Seahawks\u2019 offense is equipped to handle just about any situation.\n\n\u201cThose guys protected all day,\u201d Seattle coach Pete Carroll said. \u201cRussell had the opportunity to sit back, and then he took full advantage of it and again had another big game throwing the football.\u201d\n\nSeattle\u2019s second-ranked defense backed Wilson by keeping the Ravens (4-9) out of the end zone, forcing two turnovers and allowing only 28 yards rushing.\n\nThe Seahawks have won six of seven to move into position for an NFC wild card.\n\nBaltimore\u2019s offense sputtered under the direction of Jimmy Clausen, who completed 23 of 40 passes for a career-high 274 yards and an interception. Playing for injured Matt Schaub, he became the third quarterback to start for the Ravens.\n\n\u201cWe moved the ball but once we got down in the red zone we couldn\u2019t score and just didn\u2019t make enough big plays,\u201d Clausen said.\n\nThe loss assured Baltimore its first losing season since coach John Harbaugh took over in 2008. It was the Ravens\u2019 first game this year decided by more than eight points, and their most lopsided defeat since a 41-7 loss to New England on Dec. 22, 2013.\n\n\u201cObviously a very tough outcome. I\u2019m not happy about it; disappointed,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cThe worst we\u2019ve played all year by far.\u201d\n\nSeattle took the lead for good with a touchdown on its opening possession, moving 80 yards on a drive capped by Wilson\u2019s 8-yard touchdown pass to Lockett.\n\nLate in the half, Seattle linebacker Bobby Wagner recovered a fumble by Javorius Allen at the Baltimore 14. Two plays later, Wilson threw a touchdown pass to Baldwin for a 14-3 lead.\n\nClausen answered with two passes to Kamar Allen totaling 58 yards before Justin Tucker kicked a field goal on the final play of the half.\n\nSeattle made it 21-6 by moving 80 yards following the second-half kickoff. Wilson went 4 for 5 for 58 yards, capped by a touchdown pass to a wide-open Baldwin.\n\nThe clincher came on the first play of the fourth quarter. Lockett got open on the right sideline and caught a pass in stride ahead of cornerback Lardarius Webb for a 49-yard touchdown.\n\n\u201cYou give up the big plays and turn the ball over against a team like that, you just don\u2019t have a chance,\u201d Harbaugh said.\n\nRichard Sherman intercepted a Clausen pass to set up Wilson\u2019s final TD throw to Baldwin.\n\nThis was the second time Clausen started against Seattle this year. Playing for Chicago in September, he went 9 for 17 for 63 yards in a 26-0 loss.\n\nClausen became the sixth NFL quarterback since 1950 to start against the same team twice for different clubs during the same season. The last was Kyle Orton in 2011.\n\nNOTES: Seattle has held the lead in 61 straight games, an NFL record. \u2026 Seattle lost Safety Kam Chancellor (tailbone) in the first quarter. He did not return. \u2026 Baltimore lost DE Chris Canty (pectoral strain) in the third quarter.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Russell Wilson throws 5 TD passes as Seahawks beat Ravens", "title": "Russell Wilson throws 5 TD passes as Seahawks beat Ravens", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/13/russell-wilson-throws-5-td-passes-as-seahawks-beat-ravens/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151213__russell-wilson-doug-baldwinp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151213__russell-wilson-doug-baldwinp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-13T17:26:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T21:22:20+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1eda\"", "article_summary": "BALTIMORE \u2014 As long as Russell Wilson continues to fling touchdown passes at a dizzying rate, the Seattle Seahawks just might survive their alarming shortage of running backs.\nWilson threw five touchdown passes, three to Doug Baldwin, and Seattle wore down the injury-depleted Baltimore Ravens 35-6 Sunday for its fourth straight victory.\nTwo plays later, Wilson threw a touchdown pass to Baldwin for a 14-3 lead.\nWilson went 4 for 5 for 58 yards, capped by a touchdown pass to a wide-open Baldwin.\nRawls had already gained 47 yards during the Seahawks\u2019 first drive when he was hurt on a 3-yard loss."}
