You can come to the circus, ride an elephant, ride a pony, meet the clowns, funnel cakes, popcorn, cotton candy. What else can you ask for, but right here at the Cole Bros. Circus.\"\n\nThere will be two shows on Sunday afternoon at 1:30 p.m. and 4:30 p.m.\n\nFor more information, visit their website: http://colebroscircus.com/\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Since 2010, the Cole Bros.
