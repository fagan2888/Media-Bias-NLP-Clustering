The headline to the ABC News story explaining the results is \u201cObamacare Arrives 3 Years Later, Little Understood and Not Well-Liked.\u201d What do the results tell us?\n\nFirst, by a ten point margin (52% to 42%), the public opposes ObamaCare. \u201cThe 52% level of opposition to the law is the highest level since April 2012 in this polling series,\u201d writes Ed Morrissey. (ABC News\u2019s Damla Ergun adds, \u201cIn 16 ABC-Post polls since August 2009, it has never received majority support.\u201d) Among independents, there is slightly greater opposition\u201454% to 42%.\n\nSecond, women are very unhappy. While 46% of men support the law, only 38% of women support ObamaCare. Significantly while Obama\u2019s job performance continues to receive near unanimous support (7 out of 8) from African-Americans, not even half-48%\u2013support what is often called Obama\u2019s \u201csignature domestic accomplishment.\u201d\n\n\u201cFifty-five percent, further, disapprove of the way Barack Obama is handling implementation of the law, with \u2018strong\u2019 disapprovers outnumbering strong approvers by a 23-point margin,\u201d Ergun writes.\n\nAsked what effect ObamaCare has had thus far, almost twice as many (36%) say the law it\u2019s worsened the health care system overall as say it has improved the health care system (19%). The remaining 39% saw no effect as yet.\n\nAnd the worse number of all is when respondents were asked if felt they have adequate information on the law. Barely a third (35%) said yes, while 62% said no.\n\nIf you like, join those who are following me on Twitter at twitter.com/daveha.
