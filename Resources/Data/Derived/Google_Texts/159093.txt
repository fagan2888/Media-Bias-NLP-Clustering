Michigan Republicans have been accused of fighting a "war on women" ever since they passed a law requiring women to buy extra abortion insurance if they think they might get raped. Go figure.

On Thursday, three state House Republicans offered this rebuttal, in a tweet posted by Jake Neher of Michigan Public Radio Network:

@MIHouseGOP members Victory, Pettalia, and Glardon: "Don't say we don't understand women." #mileg pic.twitter.com/zsifsqrZ1N — Jake Neher (@GJNeher) June 5, 2014

That's Rep. Peter Pettalia, Rep. Roger Victory, and Rep. Ben Glardon reading Glamour and Harper's Bazaar—indisputable proof that they're in touch with the concerns of today's modern woman. Eat your hearts out, ladies.
