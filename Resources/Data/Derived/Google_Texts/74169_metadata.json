'Thank you, Iowa, for leading the political revolution,'\" Sanders said.\n\n\n\nPaul also used his resolutions to poke fun at rivals Trump, Cruz, and Marco Rubio, and at his own hair.\n\n\n\nThe celebratory messages from the campaigns on Thursday night were at times mixed with pleas for donations as the closely-watched fourth quarter fundraising deadline for 2015 approached.\n\n\n\nCampaigns have been releasing fundraising estimates and setting expectations in advance of the deadline, with Cruz, Clinton, and Sanders indicating they had particularly strong quarters.\n\n\n\nWhile campaigns will certainly welcome donations in 2016 as well, it may be too late to get your free Marco Rubio bumper sticker.\n\nEach candidate was trying to outpace the others in both dollar amounts and numbers of donors for the quarter, and to prove that they are carrying the most momentum into the new year. Official figures should be released by the Federal Election Commission in the coming weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Presidential candidates reached out to supporters Thursday with New Year's Eve messages and, in some cases, fundraising appeals.Several candidates, including Republican front-runner Donald Trump appeared on the Fox News New Year's Eve special.I have a very", "title": "2016 candidates wish you Happy New Year, want your money", "og": {"site_name": "KVAL", "description": "Presidential candidates reached out to supporters Thursday with New Year's Eve messages and, in some cases, fundraising appeals.Several candidates, including Republican front-runner Donald Trump appeared on the Fox News New Year's Eve special.I have a very", "title": "2016 candidates wish you Happy New Year, want your money", "url": "http://kval.com/news/nation-world/2016-candidates-wish-you-happy-new-year-want-your-money", "image": "http://static-12.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/e7bfc1c3-8e17-43df-8bcb-fb68ff7a7067-large16x9_APTOPIXNewYearsEve_Loia.jpg?1451662455386", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "http://twitter.com/kvalnews", "image": "http://static-11.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/e7bfc1c3-8e17-43df-8bcb-fb68ff7a7067-large16x9_APTOPIXNewYearsEve_Loia.jpg?1451662455386", "description": "Presidential candidates reached out to supporters Thursday with New Year's Eve messages and, in some cases, fundraising appeals.Several candidates, including Republican front-runner Donald Trump appeared on the Fox News New Year's Eve special.I have a very", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "2016 candidates wish you Happy New Year, want your money"}, "author": "Sinclair Broadcast Group", "blitz": "mu-cc36119f-f4dca522-3261b206-4b3bbd3f", "robots": "index, follow", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 132298800461104}, "keywords": "bernie sanders,ted cruz,marco rubio,twitter,nation & world,2016 election,rand paul,mike huckabee,donald trump,OR", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/kvalnews", "published_time": "2016-01-01T11:31:41+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=0.5"}, "article_summary": "Paul also used his resolutions to poke fun at rivals Trump, Cruz, and Marco Rubio, and at his own hair.\n\"2016 is going to be the last year of the Obama presidency,\" Cruz said.\nSeveral candidates, including Republican front-runner Donald Trump appeared on the Fox News New Year's Eve special.\nPresidential candidates reached out to supporters Thursday with New Year's Eve messages and, in some cases, fundraising appeals.\n\"2016 is going to be the last year before Hillary retires permanently to Chappaqua.\""}
