A new web video supporting former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush promises he’ll make life better for everyone in America — problem is, the video features images from England and Asia.

Right to Rise USA, Mr. Bush’s super PAC, paid for the ad, which features the sun rising over a field promising a “brighter path” forward — but unfortunately that field and and path is in Cornwall, England, Politico reported. The video also shows a clip of a construction worker with text on the screen saying “America is great” — but the footage was filmed in southeast Asia.

“Cornwall is lovely this time of year,” Joe Scarborough mocked Wednesday on his MSNBC show “Morning Joe.” “How you do that?”

“It’s not ideal,” said Bloomberg’s Mark Halperin, discussing the web video on the same show. “They shouldn’t have made a mistake like that.”

Right to Rise didn’t immediately respond to comment from Politico.

The web video seeks to contrast Mr. Bush with GOP front-runner Donald Trump, using a positive, optimistic tone compared to Mr. Trump’s darker message.

“If we get a few big things right, we can make lives better for millions of people in this nation where every life matters and everyone has the right to rise,” Mr. Bush says in the video.
