NEWPORT, R.I. (AP) — This City by the Sea is riding a wave of excitement harkening to its heyday as an international sailing mecca as it hosts this year’s only North American stopover on the Volvo Ocean Race.

The sailors from the six teams arrived this week in Newport. The teams departed Oct. 11 from Alicante, Spain, on the 45,000-mile race that will conclude in June in Gothenburg, Sweden. Newport’s race village will stay open through May 17, when the sailors begin racing toward Lisbon, Portugal. A seventh team was forced to suspend racing after its boat smashed into an Indian Ocean reef in November.

Newport used its rich sailing history to help beat out Baltimore, Maryland, a much bigger city that has hosted once before, for the chance to host — and to bring in millions from visitors. The area’s last major sailing event — America’s Cup World Series in 2012 — drew 65,000 people and generated about $50 million.

Volvo Ocean Race CEO Knut Frostad said Newport was chosen because of its history, and also because its residents and visitors are passionate about sailing.

“The sailors love it,” Frostad said. “They love coming to places where people love what they’re doing and are following the sport.”

Founded in 1639, Newport has always relied on the sea for commerce, transportation and defense. Recreational sailing came later, in 1844, when the New York Yacht Club first cruised to Newport and fell in love with the city’s deep waters and dependable winds. The club soon created an outpost in Newport.

Bert Lippincott, reference librarian for the Newport Historical Society, said this was the “birth of American yachting.”

“You’ve got one of the most beautiful coastlines in the world,” Lippincott said. “There’s nothing like it.”

The yacht club chose Newport in 1930 to host the America’s Cup match race. The international event draws tourists from around the world.
