To satisfy demand, the developer decided to release the two townhome buildings with premium locations much earlier than expected.\n\nThe new phase includes six new homes from the Legacy of Mountain Lakes \u201cCarriage Series\u201d which were designed to meet the needs of today\u2019s young, sophisticated buyer. Often drawing first-time buyers from more urban locales such as Hoboken, Jersey City and even Manhattan, the three-story Carriage Series townhomes provide a more affordable opportunity for buyers looking to enjoy the low-maintenance lifestyle of a new construction home and all of the benefits a Mountain Lakes address has to offer.\n\n\u201cHomebuyers realize we\u2019re nearing the end of our sales program and that this is their best opportunity to select the home location of their choice at Morris County\u2019s premier new townhome community,\u201d Hornblass said. \u201cIt has translated into a number of sales in the past few weeks alone and heavy interest in all of our available townhomes.\n\n\u201cThese new homes offer an enhanced suburban setting in one of Northern New Jersey\u2019s most attractive locations and well-appointed, luxurious interiors with considerable space and room to grow. As buyers rush to avoid missing out on this one-of-a-kind housing opportunity, we don\u2019t expect our remaining homes to be available very long,\u201d Hornblass added.\n\nHomes in Legacy\u2019s Carriage Series are offered in two designs, the \u201cMidvale\u201d and the \u201cHillcrest\u201d, both of which offer three-bedroom layouts with two full baths, two half baths and one- or two-car garages. These townhomes range from 2,162 to 2,236 of finished square-feet and are priced from $599,900. The Carriage Series homes feature expansive living spaces, exquisite finishes and a modern, \u201copen concept\u201d layout.\n\nThe new phase will also accommodate all home designs in Legacy\u2019s \u201cSignature Series\u201d collection, which will include premium locations surrounded by wooded terrain and beautifully landscaped grounds.\n\nHomes in the Legacy\u2019s Signature Series feature three bedrooms, two-and-a-half baths baths and either 2,829 or 2,853 square feet of luxury living space, priced from $799,900.\n\nBoth the Carriage Series and Signature Series collections are being offered with a limited-time incentive program that includes a top-of-the-line Wolf range/oven added to special gourmet kitchens at no extra cost.\n\nLegacy of Mountain Lakes has proven to have broad appeal to a wide range of home buyers. Buyers to date have cited the community\u2019s visually stunning location, excellent quality-of-life and top-notch public school system as motivating factors.\n\n\u201cMany buyers who have their heart set on Mountain Lakes are pleasantly surprised to learn about the multiple townhome designs we offer and just how much quality, space and comfort they are receiving for their home buying dollar,\u201d said David Hornblass, another HornRock principal.\n\n\u201cThe combination of a beautiful new construction townhome and this classic American small town setting is proving to be a tremendous draw. The community is buzzing with activity every day as our residents enjoy everything this tremendous location offers,\u201d he added.\n\nSituated at the intersection of Morris Avenue and Fanny Road, Legacy of Mountain Lakes offers a superb Morris County location characterized by winding country roads, bucolic lakes and heavily wooded terrain.
