At least not after this.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve maintained a very, very strong desire to stay in Colorado,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI really love playing in Denver and I love my teammates. I love the coaching staff and I love playing for Patrick (Roy), and having Joe (Sakic) in charge is awesome.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my desire to stay here, but it has to work for both sides and I\u2019m all for working with the team and trying to fit into the structure. I\u2019m not out to get something over my value on the market. I\u2019m going to work with them and I hope they work with me and we can get something done.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI\u2019m a big believer that you have to think about hockey and hockey only. If you have other stuff, that can distract you. I think it\u2019s only detrimental and you don\u2019t want that distraction, with reporters just coming in after practice and just talking about your contract. You want to talk about the team, and I\u2019d like to get it done as soon as possible so it\u2019s not a distraction.\u201d\n\nJohnson, 27, was having a career year when he underwent arthroscopic knee surgery during the all-star break and didn\u2019t play again last season. He skated and seemed to be trying to get back in the lineup, but never did.\n\n\u201cAfter today I\u2019m very pleased with how I feel,\u201d he said after practice at training camp. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve taken my game to another level as far as conditioning, and as far as my knee injury there\u2019s no issue whatsoever.\u201d\n\nAvalanche weekend schedule\n\nThe Avs will be on the Family Sports Center ice in Centennial for the second and final day of training camp at 8:30 a.m. Saturday. Veterans will practice first, then the younger players will scrimmage.\n\nThe Burgundy-White intrasquad game is 1 p.m. Sunday at the University of Denver.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Erik Johnson, Avalanche veteran defenseman, said staying put \u201chas to work for both sides\u201d", "title": "Erik Johnson, Avalanche veteran defenseman, said staying put \u201chas to work for both sides\u201d", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/19/erik-johnson-avalanche-veteran-defenseman-said-staying-put-has-to-work-for-both-sides/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150919__erik-johnson-colorado-avalanche-APp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150919__erik-johnson-colorado-avalanche-APp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-19T09:32:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T17:44:17+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Veteran defenseman Erik Johnson, who can be an unrestricted free agent next July if he hasn\u2019t re-signed with the Avalanche, said Friday he won\u2019t talk about his contract situation.\nI love the coaching staff and I love playing for Patrick (Roy), and having Joe (Sakic) in charge is awesome.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my desire to stay here, but it has to work for both sides and I\u2019m all for working with the team and trying to fit into the structure.\n\u201cAfter today I\u2019m very pleased with how I feel,\u201d he said after practice at training camp.\n\u201cI\u2019ve maintained a very, very strong desire to stay in Colorado,\u201d Johnson said."}
