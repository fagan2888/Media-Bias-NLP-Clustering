There can be penalties if hospitals fail to use them.\n\nDr. David J. Mathison, a pediatric emergency physician with the Children's National Health System, said that being able to access information in an emergency setting improves patient care.\n\nEHRs also provide clinical decision support and medical alerts to improve quality and reduce errors, he noted.\n\nThe laborious EHR user interface inevitably reduces the number of patients a provider can see on a given shift. Dr. David J. Mathison, Children\u2019s National Health System\n\n\u201cHowever, the attention required for staff to engage with the EHR removes doctors and physicians from patient care and disrupts the flow of the ED [emergency department],\u201d Mathison told Healthline.\n\nMathison said that emergency room employees have spent more time documenting information and less time with patients since EHR adoption.\n\nWhile the quality of care may not be affected, the patient experience may be affected.\n\n\u201cThe laborious EHR user interface inevitably reduces the number of patients a provider can see on a given shift, making the need for scribes, transcription services, and midlevel practitioners increasingly important in emergency medicine,\u201d Mathison added.\n\nRead More: Medical Facilities Are Inviting Targets for Cyber Attacks \u00bb\n\nMistakes, Multitasking\n\nDr. Corey K. Smith, an emergency medicine physician based in New Jersey, said he feels there are more medical errors since EHRs came into use.\n\nSmith said companies have added more user-friendly features to accommodate the time crunch clinicians face.\n\nDespite these attempts, the EHR system does provide more opportunity for error. The wrong patient history, physical description, or wrong medication may be mistakenly selected from a prepopulated list.\n\n\u201cThe electronic health record also gives the reader less of a true feel of the patient encounter due to the fragmented template style of the generated chart,\u201d he said.\n\nAn increase in multitasking since the EHR requirement was implemented has made it more challenging for physicians who work in the already complex and dynamic environment of the emergency department, said Raj Ratwani, Ph.D., scientific director and senior research scientist at the National Center for Human Factors in Healthcare in Washington, D.C.\n\nHe conducted a study on EHR use in emergency departments last year.\n\n\u201cRapid task switching leads to increased stress and frustration and can have serious patient safety implications. Multitasking rarely improves human performance,\u201d Ratwani noted in a press release about the study.\n\nRead More: Too Busy for Your Own Good? \u00bb\n\nAre Scribes a Solution?\n\nDr. David Birdsall, an emergency room physician and vice president for CEP America, advocates the use of scribes.\n\nScribes are trained in EHR management and patient documentation. They are either undergraduates or postbaccalaureate students with an interest in the healthcare field.\n\n\u201cMost, but not all scribes, have the intention of attending medical, physician assistant, or nursing school. They get great experience, ED staff gets the help they need,\u201d said Birdsall, whose company provides acute care staffing solutions for emergency rooms.\n\nI didn\u2019t have to worry about taking notes or documenting. The scribe took care of that while I took care of the patient. Dr. David Birdsall, CEP America\n\n\u201cAt work the other day I had a scribe,\u201d Birdsall told Healthline. \u201cThis allowed me to go into a room, sit down at the bedside, look the patient in the eye, and hold their hand while they told me their story. I didn\u2019t have to worry about taking notes or documenting. The scribe took care of that while I took care of the patient.\u201d\n\nBirdsall was careful to point out that EHRs do enhance patient care overall, but medical professionals need to be vigilant about the patient and not just stare at screens.\n\n\u201cWe have to look at the patient and make that provider-to-patient connection,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with people during what is often a scary time due to an accident or illness\u2026We have to also make that human connection.\u201d\n\nRead More: Why Do So Many Doctors Die by Suicide? \u00bb", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/electronic-health-records-creating-problems-for-emergency-rooms", "news_keywords": "emergency rooms, electronic health records, affordable care act, obamacare, emergency rooms electronic health records, hospitals electronic health records, emergency rooms too busy to keep electronic health records", "og": {"site_name": "Healthline", "description": "Electronic health records are useful for sharing information, but may take time away from patient care, some emergency room physicians say.", "title": "Electronic Health Records Creating Problems for Emergency Rooms", "url": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/electronic-health-records-creating-problems-for-emergency-rooms", "image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/031616_electronicrecords_THUMB.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/031616_electronicrecords_THUMB.jpg", "description": "Electronic health records are useful for sharing information, but may take time away from patient care, some emergency room physicians say.", "card": "summary", "title": "Electronic Health Records Creating Problems for Emergency Rooms"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP", "DC.date.issued": "2016-03-16", "fb": {"app_id": 239371929577489}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Electronic health records are useful for sharing information, but may take time away from patient care, some emergency room physicians say."}, "article_summary": "Dr. David J.
