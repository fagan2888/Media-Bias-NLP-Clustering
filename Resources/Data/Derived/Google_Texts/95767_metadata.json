Hetherington, author and a professor of political science at Vanderbilt University, writes, \u201cDeeply negative feelings cause more trouble than deep ideological differences would.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you disagree with the other side on the issues, you can often find a middle ground. When you don\u2019t like the other side, you don\u2019t even talk to them\u2026. Absent trust, any bridges that form between the two sides are made of sand.\u201d\n\nHetherington postulates a political dynamic in which lawmakers more often than not reflect the views of their constituents than to try to be thought leaders and influence their voters.\n\nRelated: Why Congress Will Get Even Less Done in 2016\n\nThis can be highly problematic, especially in the vast majority of congressional districts that are demographically and politically homogenized because of gerrymandering by Republican and Democratic-controlled state legislatures.\n\nFor sure, the clash of ideologies also explains perpetual gridlocks in Washington, not to mention the intensely bitter relations between the Obama White House and GOP-dominated Congress.\n\nHetherington views this visceral negativity as a troubling trend and a reflection of politicians frequently taking cues from their constituents. \u201cAlthough citizens have it in their capacity to nudge officeholders toward compromise, they don\u2019t trust their opponents enough to push their side\u2019s representatives to compromise with those they increasingly view as the devil,\u201d Hetherington writes.\n\nThe end result, he says, is \u201cstagnation\u201d and the kind of gridlock that led, for example, to a near default on U.S. borrowing in 2011, the 2013 government shutdown and former GOP House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s forced retirement late last year in the face of a revolt by conservative Republicans who were unwilling to reach a compromise with Democrats on budget and spending issues.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "For many years, experts blamed sharp ideological difference between the two parties fo", "title": "The Real Reason Republicans and Democrats Can\u2019t All Just Get Along", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/02/Real-Reason-Republicans-and-Democrats-Can-t-All-Just-Get-Along", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/10312013_Puck_Gridlock_Partisan.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/02/Real-Reason-Republicans-and-Democrats-Can-t-All-Just-Get-Along", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/10312013_Puck_Gridlock_Partisan.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "For many years, experts blamed sharp ideological difference between the two parties fo", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cAlthough citizens have it in their capacity to nudge officeholders toward compromise, they don\u2019t trust their opponents enough to push their side\u2019s representatives to compromise with those they increasingly view as the devil,\u201d Hetherington writes.\nNow comes a new book, Why Washington Won\u2019t Work: Polarization, Political Trust and the Governing Crisis, with a very different take: The reason Republicans and Democrats fight so vehemently is not because of ideological differences, but because they simply don\u2019t like each other.\nThe Pew Research Center in 2014 famously issued a study concluding that Republicans and Democrats \u201care more divided along ideological lines \u2013 and partisan antipathy is deeper and more extensive\u201d -- than at any point in the past 20 years.\n\u201cAnd ideological thinking is now much more closely aligned with partisanship than in the past,\u201d the authors of the study wrote.\nHetherington views this visceral negativity as a troubling trend and a reflection of politicians frequently taking cues from their constituents."}
