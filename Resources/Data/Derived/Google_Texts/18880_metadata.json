It is the only country where a court that grants gay people the right to marry also defends the right of the wealthy to pour almost unlimited funds into elections.\n\nThe political logic that links these facts is not a liberalism that progressives in Europe or Canada would recognize. It is a homegrown libertarian ideology \u2014 one that has opened the way for marriage equality, but privileges economic growth for the few over socio-economic equity for the many.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling, this week, on King v. Burwell \u2014 which preserved Americans\u2019 access to expensive, inadequate and confusing insurance policies subsidized by the Affordable Care Act \u2014 hardly signals a swift drift toward European social democracy. Obamacare is an essentially conservative law that places government resources in service of private enterprise.\n\nThe events of the past week hardly signal a swift drift toward European social democracy.\n\nMeanwhile, the backlash against the Confederate flag in the wake of the Charleston shooting is a welcome blow against a symbol of hate. But calling for the removal of the flag from public property has provided cover for politicians who cannot or will not address the real problem \u2014 easy access to guns. Wal-Mart\u2019s executives decided to stop selling Confederate paraphernalia last week. But they will continue to offer a wide selection of firearms and ammunition as long as Second Amendment fundamentalists block federal gun control.\n\nWhen the Founding Fathers cast off the yoke of King George, they created a revolutionary state with fear of \u201cbig government\u201d built into its institutions and engrained in its culture. For better or worse, the leaders of that revolutionary state came to have the narrowest political imagination in the West. America is the only nation among its peers with no equivalent to a Tory right or a socialist left \u2014 both traditions that consider centralized government a force for good, an agent of stewardship and progress.\n\nA cultural chasm still divides the United States from the other liberal democracies of the West because suspicion of federal authority is embedded in America's DNA. The advance of gay rights last week signals that secular libertarianism is on the ascent while its Christian cousin is in retreat. But conservatives, fear not: The social democratic Satan, the great Scandinavianization, is a long way off.\n\n\n\nJoin Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/roomfordebate.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"thumbnail_75": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/06/26/opinion/RFDliberal/RFDliberal-thumbStandard.jpg", "twitter": {"image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/06/26/opinion/RFDliberal/RFDliberal-articleInline.jpg"}, "communityAssetTaxonomy": "opinion/roomfordebate/red-white-and-bluer", "applicationName": "shell", "PT": "blogs", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/06/26/opinion/RFDliberal/RFDliberal-articleInline.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "thumbnail_75_width": 75, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/06/26/opinion/RFDliberal/RFDliberal-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "The events of the past week hardly signal a swift drift toward European social democracy.
