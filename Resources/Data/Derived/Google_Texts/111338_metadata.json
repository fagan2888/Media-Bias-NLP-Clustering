But the state of Alaska is learning the hard way those cuts \u2014 especially when they are for taxes on oil companies \u2014 don\u2019t always deliver as promised.\n\nAlaska is the only state with neither a state income tax nor a state sales tax. For revenue, it relies entirely on federal funding and various taxes on oil production in the state. Back in 2013, the oil taxes were altered by legislation passed under former Governor Sean Parnell (R). The logic of the bill \u2014 which flattened the tax rate, thus cutting the tax burden for high-dollar oil profits and raising it for low-dollar profits \u2014 was that it would spur renewed oil industry activity in the state. But that expected economic ferment has not materialized. And now, as the price of oil drops lower and lower, Alaska\u2019s state budget is falling well into the red.\n\n\u201c[I]n recent years taxes on oil production have covered more than half the total budget ($13.5 billion including federal funds and capital projects) and 90 percent of the state\u2019s discretionary spending ($6.5 billion to run agencies and schools),\u201d the Washington Post reported on Wednesday. \u201cNow, with prices under $70 a barrel, the budget deficit could balloon to more than $3 billion, about half of the state\u2019s discretionary spending level.\u201d\n\nAccording to work in mid-2014 from Alaska\u2019s Institute of Social and Economic Research (ISER) \u2014 when the revenue hole in the oil tax was anticipated to be $2.1 billion for this year \u2014 the overwhelming majority of the drop was due to the change in oil prices. Whether the old or new tax regime will bring in more revenue is disputed, but another ISER study projected that, under the most likely assumptions for future oil prices and production costs, the old structure would\u2019ve brought in about $1.3 billion more revenue over the next five years.\n\nNewly-installed Governor Bill Walker \u2014 an independent who quit the Republican Party to run a joint-ticket campaign with Alaska\u2019s Democrats in the recent midterm elections \u2014 supported a referendum to undo the tax cut, but it was narrowly defeated by voters back in August. Walker also supported taking up the expansion of Medicaid \u2014 the joint federal-state health insurance program for the poor \u2014 that\u2019s on offer under the Affordable Care Act. Parnell had resisted the move, citing cost concerns.\n\nIn November, Walker told the Alaska Dispatch News that \u201che doesn\u2019t plan to offer changes to the tax structure this session. But he plans to monitor whether the tax is having the desired effect of more oil in the pipeline and increased industry investment.\u201d\n\nAccording to previous reporting from the Dispatch News, oil production in Alaska has actually been slowly declining ever since the late 1980s, when it peaked at 2 million barrels per day. Advocates for the oil tax cut had insisted the policy change would reverse that trend. But new state projections at the start of 2014 anticipated a continued decline to 312,000 barrels per day by the end of the decade, from 531,000 barrels per day in 2013.\n\nIn a way, Alaska\u2019s tax cut was an attempt to fight forces far bigger than the state or its policymakers could possibly control. Since oil from Alaska works just as well as oil from Russia, the Middle East, or Venezuela, the price of oil is determined by the global market. And the fact is, global oil production has not been able to keep pace with the growth in global demand for sometime.\n\nThere can be blips like the current price drop, thanks to things like the North American boom in shale production, or decisions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries \u2014 a cooperative organization and economic cartel of Middle Eastern, South American, and African states \u2014 to flood the market with supply to move prices. But oil is a physical resource, and there\u2019s only so much of it under the ground, and supplies will inevitably become ever more difficult to maintain as producers drill for more nontraditional reserves. Meanwhile, enormous populations in China and India especially are attempting a mass movement into the global middle class \u2014 and unless the world can engineer a mass move onto renewables and electric vehicles, and soon, their appetite for oil could grow massively.\n\nThat means, long-term, it\u2019s still about supply and demand, and oil is just going to become harder and harder to come by.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The state gets most of its revenue from taxes on the oil industry, which it cut in 2013 to spur economic activity.
