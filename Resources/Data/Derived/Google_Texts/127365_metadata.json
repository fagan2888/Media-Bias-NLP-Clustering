Many things have changed since March 23, 2010 when it was passed into law. Website rollouts, cost curves and enrollment figures have dominated the new stories. What we speak so little of, however, is how health care has actually been reformed and how this in turn defined what health care reform means to us today.\n\nTo do this, we would need to examine the groups responsible for what ultimately became the bill passed into law, which can help us make sense of what we consider health care reform today. Health care reform is the product of \"bootlegger\" and \"baptist\" interests coming together to restructure the industry in their favor, all brought together by a \"televangelist\" administration.\n\nSo what in the world does all that mean?\n\n\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on Obamacare]\n\n\"Bootleggers\" and \"baptists\" refer to two groups: those that support economic interests and those that support moral interests. The original \"B&B\" combo came with Prohibition as bootleggers gained considerable sums off legislation favored by Baptists and others acting in the \"public interest.\" Those that wish to prosper off others find it difficult to do so, unless there is a moral counterpart to dress it up as in the public interest. As Prohibition showed, B&B interests don't even have to recognize one another. It all just comes by providence.\n\nBut sometimes providence is not enough. Sometimes these groups need a kick in the pants by a would-be \"televangelist,\" in this case, from the president's pulpit. Having just arrived in office, President Barack Obama met with both bootleggers and baptists to ensure they would support his health care reform agenda. They did so in a public letter of approval signed by the American Cancer Society, American Medical Association, Families USA, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, Regence BlueCross BlueShield and the Service Employees International Union. Bootleggers and baptists aplenty.\n\nStill, there were other bootleggers like insurance groups who felt the bill was not in their best interest. These interests ran a blitzkrieg of negative ads, heaping much attention on the considerable increase in costs the bill would engender. This issue became a major sticking point during a series of town hall meetings conducted by proponents of the bill, as private citizens became nervous about what the bill would ultimately mean. As a consequence, proponents of reform let once-requisite features of the bill fall by the wayside in deference to this bootlegger opposition. (Public option, anyone?)\n\n\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on the Economy]\n\nAnd any fence sitters faced their own opposition from other bootleggers like big pharma, which saw plenty to gain from a bill that promised a ban on competing products by foreign-based pharmaceutical companies. This is why a ramshackle bill that no one really understood became law of the land. How could anyone understand a document shaped by so many disparate interests?\n\nToday, we see the ebb and flow of this maelstrom of interests constantly as different components of the law are delayed, changed or removed altogether. Indeed, there are whole conference series dedicated to unpacking what health care reform actually means.\n\nWhich brings us to what health care reform means for us today. The answer of course is we don't know. But the answer to why we don't know is easier. Bootleggers and baptists are seldom in accord except to favor their own mutual interests. When brought together by an eager televangelist, they run rampant over constitutional barriers, not to mention personal rights. This is unfortunately politics in practice.\n\nBut there is an upside. We can acknowledge that reform at the highest levels of government will only engender a politically powerful group of bootlegger and baptist interests that have no real comprehension of what is really in the public interest, only what is in the interests of the group represented.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Economic Intelligence [Opinion]", "title": "How Obamacare Is Like Prohibition", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Self-interest got dressed up as public interest and the consequences are still being sorted out.", "title": "How Obamacare Is Like Prohibition", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/economic-intelligence/2015/05/18/how-obamacare-is-like-prohibition", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/18/fc/8efda97f425f844e08f2a0cbf6e2/150106-booze-stock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Self-interest got dressed up as public interest and the consequences are still being sorted out.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "How Obamacare Is Like Prohibition"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "May 18, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Adam C.
