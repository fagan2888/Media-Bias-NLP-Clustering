But according to a new book, it\u2019s all a fa\u00e7ade. The book, by a Moscow political scientist, claims that Putin is actually a pathetic weakling.\n\nThe controversial biography, Putin, by Stanislav Belkovsky, says that an unhappy childhood left Putin shy, unassertive, and scarred to this day. Belkovsky says the tough-guy show that Putin puts on for the Russian press is just an act to hide his insecurities.\n\nRelated: Six Reasons Vladimir Putin Is Primed for a Fall\n\n\u201cThe small Vladimir, who grew up practically without a father and without the love and care of his parents, was a withdrawn and grim child,\u201d Belkovsky writes, according to Der Spiegel, the German weekly news magazine. He alleges that Putin was born two years before the year he gives as his birth \u2013 and that he was born to an alcoholic father. He says Putin\u2019s mother shipped the child off to St. Petersburg (then Leningrad), where the couple who would act as his parents raised him.\n\nBelkovsky, described as a star columnist at a Moscow tabloid, also insinuates that Putin, who is divorced with two daughters, might be gay. He calls the Russian president a \u201cgay icon,\u201d adding that in 2007 Putin participated in a \u201ctruly erotic photo session in which Putin and Prince Albert of Monaco posed topless with their fishing rods in their hands.\" (He stops short of calling Putin gay, hedging that \"a cult figure among homosexuals is not automatically a homosexual himself.\")\n\nRelated: Slide Show: Vladimir Putin: International Man of Mystery\n\nBelkovsky offers little proof for any of this; it\u2019s bad armchair psychology at best. He also acknowledges that people who write these kinds of things about Putin often meet unfortunate ends \u2013 he even mentions a journalist who died under mysterious circumstances after researching Putin\u2019s background.\n\nBut the book is gaining popularity in Moscow. It\u2019s become so popular that the Kremlin has been forced to respond to it.\n\n\u201cBelkovsky's remarks are lacking any basis, or as we say it in Russia: They are total rubbish,\u201d Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told der Spiegel.\n\nBut the cat\u2019s outta the bag, or as they\u2019d say in Moscow, sbilsya koshki meshok. Now, Belkovsky better be careful or he might end up mertvyy.\n\nThat\u2019s Russian for dead. - Follow David Francis on Twitter @davidcfrancis\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A new book claims that Russian President Vladimir Putin tough guy fa\u00e7ade is all an act.", "title": "Why Putin May Not Be the Man We Think He Is", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/12/04/Why-Putin-May-Not-Be-Man-We-Think-He", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/12052013_Putin_Fishing.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/12/04/Why-Putin-May-Not-Be-Man-We-Think-He", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/12052013_Putin_Fishing.jpg", "creator": "@davidcfrancis", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A new book claims that Russian President Vladimir Putin tough guy fa\u00e7ade is all an act.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8495\"", "article_summary": "Related: Slide Show: Vladimir Putin: International Man of MysteryBelkovsky offers little proof for any of this; it\u2019s bad armchair psychology at best.\n(He stops short of calling Putin gay, hedging that \"a cult figure among homosexuals is not automatically a homosexual himself.\")\nThe controversial biography, Putin, by Stanislav Belkovsky, says that an unhappy childhood left Putin shy, unassertive, and scarred to this day.\nTo the citizens of Russia, President Vladimir Putin is a judo-chopping, tiger-taming, Edward Snowden-protecting, U.S.-defying national hero.\nBelkovsky says the tough-guy show that Putin puts on for the Russian press is just an act to hide his insecurities."}
