In August of this year, the agency published its final ruling on modernizing poultry slaughter inspections, which in theory should have reduced salmonella and other poultry pathogen contamination.\n\n\u201cBut the guidelines didn\u2019t include information on the effectiveness of each practice,\u201d the new GAO report noted. \u201cWithout providing this information in future guidelines, USDA isn\u2019t fully informing the poultry industry of the potential benefits of adopting these practices and encouraging their implementation.\u201d\n\nPoor practices often result in harmful bacteria ending up in your food: In a January analysis, Consumer Reports found the presence of potentially harmful bacteria in nearly all of the more than 300 raw chicken breasts it purchased at stores across the U.S.\n\nMoreover, large outbreaks continue. The most recent salmonella outbreak between 2013 and 2014 was linked to chicken products produced in California by the poultry giant Foster Farms. The outbreak affected 29 states and Puerto Rico and resulted in more than 600 reported illnesses and 200 hospitalizations.\n\nRelated: Tuna Gets Snagged in Food Safety Tug-of-War\n\nSymptoms of salmonella infection include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps. The illness usually lasts four to seven days and most people recover from it without treatment. Yet some people may develop a blood infection and become extremely ill; roughly 400 people each year die of salmonella poisoning.\n\nOne big problem, the GAO report said, is that the USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has limited authority to enforce its salmonella standards and doesn\u2019t have the same mandatory food recall authority that the Food and Drug Administration has. Additionally, FSIS hasn\u2019t classified salmonella as an adulterant in raw poultry products, the GAO report said.\n\nThe GAO recommends that USDA develop additional performance measures for salmonella and campylobacter contamination in poultry products and ensure that future guidelines for controlling these bacteria on farms include information about the effectiveness of each practice. The USDA has agreed with these recommendations.\n\nIn the meantime, consumers are in charge of what they put on their plates. Although the Consumer Reports analysis didn\u2019t find brands of chicken breasts with less bacteria than others, there are some important rules to follow when eating chicken:\n\nDon\u2019t wash raw poultry before cooking it. Otherwise you risk spreading the bacteria in poultry juices to other foods, utensils and surfaces.\n\nRelated: Eat All the Fried Chicken You Want!\n\nDo wash your hands before and after touching raw poultry. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing your hands with soap and hot water, but if these aren't immediately available, use hand sanitizer until you can properly wash. You should also thoroughly clean any surface or plate that comes in contact with raw poultry.\n\nSelect chickens raised without antibiotics. \u201cChickens without antibiotic resistance to salmonella and other dangerous pathogens can\u2019t pass antibiotic-resistant bugs on to you,\u201d Robert Lawrence, professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told Consumer Reports. If you decide to purchase organic chicken, know that while it was raised without antibiotics, chickens can be treated with antibiotics up until their first day of life, as the publication noted.\n\nCook poultry at 165\u00b0F and chill leftovers quickly. This is the safe minimum temperature, according to the CDC. You should use a thermometer to accurately measure the meat\u2019s temperature. It\u2019s also wise to refrigerate or freeze leftovers within two hours of cooking, or one hour if temperatures are above 90\u00b0F.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Although the U.S.", "title": "America\u2019s Favorite Food Just Got a Warning Label", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/21/America-s-Favorite-Food-Just-Got-Warning-Label", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01042011_food_safety_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/21/America-s-Favorite-Food-Just-Got-Warning-Label", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01042011_food_safety_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Although the U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdce73\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBut the guidelines didn\u2019t include information on the effectiveness of each practice,\u201d the new GAO report noted.\nAdditionally, FSIS hasn\u2019t classified salmonella as an adulterant in raw poultry products, the GAO report said.\nDo wash your hands before and after touching raw poultry.\nRelated: How Americans Like Their Burgers in 2014The USDA developed guidelines in 2010 for controlling salmonella and campylobacter on poultry farms.\nOne big problem, the GAO report said, is that the USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has limited authority to enforce its salmonella standards and doesn\u2019t have the same mandatory food recall authority that the Food and Drug Administration has."}
