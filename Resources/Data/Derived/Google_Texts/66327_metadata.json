The Addison, Illinois-based buyer, founded in 1987, has grown to include an eCommerce segment, a group of local field service and parts distribution operations and a list of partners that includes roughly 200 manufacturers of restaurant equipment.\n\nCarter Morse & Mathias served as NACPS's exclusive financial adviser for the transaction. This is the investment bank's second time advising NACPS on a sale. Shipman Goodwin handled legal matters for NACPS, while Weil Gotshal & Manges did the same for Parts Town.
