DARRELL R. SANTSCHI, STAFF PHOTO Related article \u00bb\n\nInland school districts are trying to figure out what to do about new federal health care rules that call on them to give benefits to some substitute teachers.\n\nConcerned about the cost, Hemet schools have already started limiting how many days substitutes can work in an attempt to avoid paying benefits.\n\nHemet Unified School District appears to be the largest local district to prevent subs from working full-time hours. A few districts, such as Riverside Unified School District, will pay the insurance.\n\nHemet Unified School District board President Paul Bakkom said the board didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t direct administrators how to deal with the topic, but he understands their financial motivation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to step into a hole we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t step out of,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nLarge employers, such as almost every Inland school district, will face penalties if they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t offer health insurance to full-time employees in 2015. The law, often called Obamacare, defines anyone who regularly works more than 30 hours a week or 130 hours a month as a full-time employee entitled to the employer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health insurance plan. However, the law asks employers to average each employee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hours over a period ranging from three to 12 months.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098FULL-TIME\u00e2\u0080\u0099 SUBS\n\nMost substitutes work seven hours a day, but a sub working five days a week, or 35 hours, might not be considered full-time because he or she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work that much every week. Substitute teachers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 pay varies by district, ranging from about $100 to $140 per day.\n\nMost districts have a regular pool of subs, who may work full-time some weeks but not at all other weeks.\n\nSchool district officials say they have no idea how many substitutes may be eligible and what the insurance might cost. Most are now studying substitutes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 pay records.\n\nTo keep substitutes from working full-time, Hemet district administrators asked principals to consider using other subs instead of someone who already worked four days that week, Assistant Superintendent LaFaye Platter said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making these decisions on a case-by-case basis,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, depending on whether another substitute can handle that classroom.\n\nInland district officials say they are looking back at substitutes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hours and averaging them over three months. They are trying to gather that information to plan their 2014-15 budgets, which must be adopted in June.\n\nCalifornia Teachers Association board member Don Bridge said he believes the numbers of substitute teachers who work full-time is very small.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking a lot of dollars like the districts are making it out to be,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bridge, a Chino Hills teacher.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "DAYNA STRAEHLEY", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/n2aeoq-rsubs0218abinary1455557.jpg", "content_section": "news", "content_title": "EDUCATION: Schools grapple with Obamacare\u2019s effects on substitute teachers", "author": "DAYNA STRAEHLEY", "og": {"site_name": "Press Enterprise", "description": "Education: EDUCATION: Schools grapple with Obamacare\u2019s effects on substitute teachers | full, time, substitutes, substitute, insurance, district, subs, week, work, school", "title": "EDUCATION: Schools grapple with Obamacare\u2019s effects on substitute teachers", "locale": "en", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/article/n2aeoq-rsubs0218abinary1455557.jpg", "url": "http://www.pe.com/articles/full-684580-time-substitutes.html", "type": "article"}, "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2014-02-20 20:17:11", "content_author": "DAYNA STRAEHLEY", "sailthru.title": "EDUCATION: Schools grapple with Obamacare\u2019s effects on substitute teachers", "sailthru.tags": "news, full, time, substitutes, substitute, insurance, district, subs, week, work, school", "fb": {"app_id": 1413700038878423}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/n2aeoq-rsubs0218abinary1455557.jpg", "content_type": "article", "Keywords": "full, time, substitutes, substitute, insurance, district, subs, week, work, school", "publication_date": "2014-02-20", "sailthru.image.full": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/n2aeoq-rsubs0218abinary1455557.jpg", "Description": "Education: EDUCATION: Schools grapple with Obamacare\u2019s effects on substitute teachers | full, time, substitutes, substitute, insurance, district, subs, week, work, school"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcad8c\"", "article_summary": "EDUCATION: Schools grapple with Obamacare\u2019s effects on substitute teachers Share Pin It 1 of 2 More Galleries Hemet substitute teacher Harris Kight-Moore, wearing a Native American tribal ribbon shirt after teaching preschoolers some tribal dance steps, says limiting hours shows the district doesn't respect its regular substitute teachers.\nCalifornia Teachers Association board member Don Bridge said he believes the numbers of substitute teachers who work full-time is very small.\nHemet Unified School District appears to be the largest local district to prevent subs from working full-time hours.\nSubstitute teachers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 pay varies by district, ranging from about $100 to $140 per day.\nHemet Unified School District board President Paul Bakkom said the board didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t direct administrators how to deal with the topic, but he understands their financial motivation."}
