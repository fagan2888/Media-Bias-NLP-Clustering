The DOJ released its report today, which found \u201cstructural and systemic deficiencies and practices\u2014including insufficient accountability, inadequate training and equipment, ineffective policies, and inadequate engagement with the community\u2014contribute to CDP's use of unreasonable force.\u201d\n\nThe DOJ explained its methodology:\n\nOur investigation did not focus only on highly publicized use of force incidents. Instead, our review examined nearly 600 use of force incidents that occurred between 2010 and 2013, including incidents involving the use of lethal and less lethal force. We closely analyzed these incidents, using use of force reports and other documents and evidence provided by CDP, and applied the relevant legal standards to determine whether CDP's use of force was legally justified. In addition, our evaluation of CDP's use of force was informed by many other sources, including: witness interviews and the participation of hundreds of individuals in community town hall meetings; interviews with the Division's officers, supervisors, and command staff; input from other stakeholders in the City, including elected representatives of the patrol officer and management unions, the Office of Professional Standards, the Civilian Police Review Board, members of religious communities, and other community leaders; Division policies, procedures and training materials; and analysis provided by expert police consultants DOJ retained to assist with this investigation.\n\nAs usual, the DOJ engaged in the obligatory obeisance. \u201cWe recognize the challenges faced by officers in Cleveland and in communities across the nation every day,\u201d the report stated. \u201cPolicing can be dangerous. At times, officers must use force, including deadly force, to protect lives, including their own.\u201d Later: \u201cIn addition, the vast majority of CDP officers are seeking to serve the public as best they can under dangerous and difficult conditions. These officers deserve the community's respect and gratitude.\u201d\n\nNevertheless the DOJ found enough evidence to suggest systemic abuses of power by officers at the department.\n\n\u201cThe use of force by police should be guided by a respect for human life and human dignity, the need to protect public safety, and the duty to protect individuals from unreasonable seizures under the Fourth Amendment,\u201d the DOJ stated in the report, noting that a \u201csignificant amount of the force used by CDP officers falls short of these standards.\u201d\n\nBecause this is the second time Cleveland police have found themselves the target of a federal investigation over police practices, the DOJ is insisting on a consent decree that would obligate the city to reforms as well as a federal monitor for oversight.\n\nRead the whole report here.\n\nRecent police news out of Cleveland: the cop who shot 12-year-old had been previously ruled unfit to handle a firearm, white cops involved in deadly car chase (ending pictured above) sue over alleged unfair treatment compared to black cops who kill on duty.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "For the second time in the last decade, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has found reasonable cause to believe the Cleveland Division of Police (CDP) is", "title": "DOJ Finds Pattern and Practice of Excessive Force at Cleveland Police, For the Second Time in Ten Years", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/12/04/doj-finds-pattern-and-practice-of-excess", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14177315974070.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For the second time in the last decade, the\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) has found reasonable cause to believe\nthe Cleveland Division of Police (CDP) is engaging in a pattern and\npractice of police brutality and violation of constitutional\nrights.
