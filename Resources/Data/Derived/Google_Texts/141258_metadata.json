(Jason Cohn for The Washington Post)\n\nTo explain why he was walking alone for 25 days and 422 miles across Pennsylvania, U.S. Senate hopeful Joe Sestak recalled a bit of advice he got six years ago.\n\nIt was the day that Sen. Arlen Specter became a Democrat, a move that thrilled the party but complicated Sestak\u2019s plans to run for the seat. That afternoon, Sestak had lunch with his old boss, Bill Clinton. The former president, Sestak says, jabbed a finger in his gut \u2014 and told him to follow it.\n\nOn a gray, chilly weekday afternoon six years later, his gut was leading him up a steep hill in a working-class Steel City neighborhood, 12 or so miles and 12 or so hours into Day 23 of his journey. Near the top, he spotted a potential voter, a man in baggy gray sweatpants and a black zippered hoodie stepping out of a black SUV, cigarette and Monster energy drink in hand.\n\nSestak beelined for him. He showed the man a sheet of paper \u2014 a printed Google map. Was he headed in the right direction?\n\nSestak vaguely explained that he was a former congressman who \u201cbeat someone but then lost to someone else\u201d and was now walking \u2014 yes, walking \u2014 the Keystone State. He got the man to pose with him for a selfie, handed him a business card with his personal e-mail address (\u201cjust say you\u2019re the guy who gave me directions to Steuben Street\u201d) \u2014 and then he was off again, a solitary figure hustling forth on a vision quest of his own.\n\nThe journey could be a metaphor for his politics \u2014 a go-it-alone strategy that challenges norms and only occasionally pays off. Take that follow-your-gut moment of his from six years ago: Sestak forged ahead and challenged Specter in Pennsylvania\u2019s 2010 Democratic primary for Senate \u2014 but in the process alienated Democratic leaders who coalesced behind Specter. (Clinton himself was deputized to call Sestak and ask him to drop out.) Sestak won the primary, only to lose narrowly in the general election to Republican Patrick J. Toomey.\n\nNow he is embarking on another maverick campaign to challenge Toomey in 2016. But while he is the unofficial front-runner on the Democratic side, he is carrying the baggage of 2010. National and state Democrats remain uneasy about a guy who they feel bucked their authority the last time and whose initial campaign strategy is to walk alone for a month \u2014 so much so that they are practically begging other Democrats to run against him.\n\nOn a windswept bridge over the Monongahela River, Sestak paused for a moment to reflect on his strained relations with his party. He insists he is untroubled by it. When he faced tea party opposition in 2010, he still made a point of getting to town halls early to shake protesters\u2019 hands, he said.\n\n\u201cSo how could I not go down and shake the hands of the DSCC [Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee] and say, \u2018Can we work together?\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cBut if not,\u201d he added, \u201cI understand if they have a better choice.\u201d\n\n***\n\nHis day started at 6 a.m. with a drop-off at an empty parking lot across from a Dollar General. Exactly where he was picked up at the end of the previous day. In darkness, with a backpack slung over his right shoulder, Sestak began to walk.\n\nOver the next 19 hours, he would walk 18 miles, with breaks for a campaign event, four media interviews and a visit with college students.\n\nSestak, 63, began walking in early March at Independence Hall in Philadelphia \u2014 near Delaware County, where he grew up and now lives with his wife and teenage daughter. He had averaged about 20 miles a day across Amish farmland, up icy mountains and along the shoulders of narrow thoroughfares on his journey to the Ohio border.\n\nOn this late March Thursday in Pittsburgh, he crossed into an upper-middle-class neighborhood dotted with churches and old mansions, the sidewalks vacant except for a few early morning joggers. He turned onto Fifth Avenue and went through the heart of the University of Pittsburgh campus. Students hustled past, not seeming to notice the slender, gray-haired man in an olive Navy flight jacket. They would have had no idea he is a retired three-star admiral and former member of Congress with his sights on a return to Capitol Hill, and he did not stop to tell them.\n\nThis journey, it sometimes seemed, was as much about solitude and self-reflection as retail politics or media outreach. He rarely slowed to shake hands. When he talked to strangers it was because he needed directions, sometimes darting into traffic to knock on a car window.\n\nFor better or worse, he was always a different kind of politician.\n\n\u201cAs a veteran, his service is respected in the state \u2014 and I think, more to the point, voters see in Joe a \u2018what you see is what you get\u2019 mentality,\u201d said J.B. Poersch, who was the executive director of the DSCC in 2010. \u201cThey see him as maybe anti-Washington. If you look at people\u2019s view of Congress, that\u2019s an asset.\u201d\n\nBut can he win \u2014 his way? Former Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell says some party leaders are worried that the race \u2014 which could determine the balance of power in the Senate \u2014 is too important to leave in Sestak\u2019s hands.\n\nRendell has his own reservations about Sestak: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t fit the modern-day view of a candidate.\u201d But he also thinks that forcing Sestak into a primary just because some party mandarins are uneasy with him isn\u2019t smart politics, either.\n\n\u201cCan he be more cooperative, can he listen more? Yes, I told him that,\u201d Rendell said. \u201cJoe Sestak will be Joe Sestak and there\u2019s some downside to that. . . . But people like the folksy Joe Sestak. He didn\u2019t wave a magic wand and do as well as he did [in the last election]. . . . That was not an accident. Someone must have liked him. Someone must have voted for him.\u201d\n\n\n\nSestak talks to supporters during a rally at Zeke\u2019s Coffee in Pittsburgh. (Jason Cohn for The Washington Post)\n\nAfter eight miles on foot, Sestak was picked up just past 9 a.m. and driven to a small coffee shop to greet supporters.\n\nIt turned out to be a narrow, cramped space, and his lone staffer on this journey, 23-year-old Jack Zandi, was puzzling over where Sestak should stand to speak. A barista grinding coffee said she hadn\u2019t known they were coming. It was classic Sestak style: Logistics second.\n\nMore than two dozen people showed up, and he held forth for an hour, talking mostly about foreign policy \u2014 a sweet spot for Sestak, who trumpeted his military experience while getting in a few digs at both the GOP and the Obama administration.\n\nIf official Democrats weren\u2019t taking him seriously, the other side was: Sestak was stalked at this stop, as on many others, by a camcorder-wielding guy named Ollie, a gaffe-hunting \u201ctracker\u201d hired by the conservative super PAC America Rising. Sestak introduced him to the crowd like an old friend, and Ollie saluted him with a thumbs-up.\n\nSestak is working on being more succinct. John McCain once called him after a TV appearance and told him he\u2019d talked for too long. He still uses a lot of awkward phrases, such as how he wants to right \u201cthis U.S. ship of state of trust\u201d \u2014 a classic Sestakian Navy-tinged mixed metaphor.\n\n\u201cYou really upped your game from last time,\u201d a 2010 supporter said approvingly on his way out of the coffee shop.\n\nYet in his next stop for a \u00adpublic-radio interview, Sestak stumbled.\n\nHe was caught short when the host asked about a just-breaking story that criticized him for not using \u201cformer\u201d before every reference to his \u201cadmiral\u201d title (a possible violation of military ethics, the story implied). He misunderstood a listener\u2019s question. He referred to being in Westmoreland County that day; he was actually in Allegheny.\n\n\n\nSestak, then in Congress, speaks to reporters outside the Capitol on May 28, 2010, about his decision not to drop out of the Democratic primary for Senate. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\nSestak with his wife, Susan, and daughter, Alex, at an election night event in 2010, when he lost the general election for Senate to Republican Pat Toomey. (Michael Perez/Associated Press)\n\nAround 2 p.m., Sestak had his first meal of the day. At his second radio station visit, there was a spread of sandwich fixings and other snacks, so he indulged in two celery sticks and a black coffee. Eating, he said, slows him down. His snack there would sustain him until midnight.\n\n\u201cI want to do what is required,\u201d he said. \u201cI really do this time.\u201d\n\nSestak, who commanded an aircraft carrier group after serving on Clinton\u2019s National Security Council, has an intensity that is impossible to match, which may have contributed to his reputation as a demanding boss. Just before he retired from the Navy in 2005, he was shifted away from one high-ranking Pentagon post because of what top brass referred to as a problematic \u201ccommand climate,\u201d Navy Times reported at the time. Turnover was unusually brisk among his staffers during his first term in Congress, the Hill newspaper reported in 2007.\n\nZandi, who had been Sestak\u2019s gofer for the past month, acknowledged that the pace had been crazy. He had never worked harder.\n\n\n\nSestak calls a campaign staffer who was trying to locate him to take him to a campaign event in Pittsburgh. (Jason Cohn for The Washington Post)\n\nSestak continued walking in the early evening, picking up exactly where he left off before his stops: He would let no one accuse him of not walking the entire way. It was considerably colder, with a gloomy sky and constant mist, as he began another six or so miles through a hilly, hardscrabble neighborhood.\n\nOn this day, a new public poll was released showing that 63 percent of Pennsylvania voters don\u2019t know enough about Sestak to have an opinion. Yet he trailed Toomey by only five points, with more than a third of the electorate undecided.\n\nSestak doesn\u2019t seem motivated by the kind of campaign strategizing that energizes many politicians. He gives lofty, often meandering soliloquies about restoring accountability in politics. His goal in the Senate? To be a \u201ctitan,\u201d someone allies will want \u201cto go into battle with.\u201d His issues include health-care reform \u2014 he\u2019s a stalwart cheerleader for the Affordable Care Act. He mentions autism research a lot. He favors gun control and scoffs at Toomey\u2019s bipartisan effort on gun legislation, calling him a \u201cfair-weather friend\u201d who gave up fighting after one failed vote.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t run to win, you run to fix the biggest ill that you see, the biggest challenge out there,\u201d he says. He\u2019s says the biggest deficit the country faces is a lack of trust.\n\nAfter spending an hour talking to a dozen University of Pittsburgh undergrads, Sestak was once again dropped off on the unlit shoulder of the road at almost 11 p.m. Ahead of him was a 3 1/ 2 -mile uphill haul along a major thoroughfare, the only light coming from Sestak\u2019s headlamp and the brights of passing tractor-trailers.\n\nStill, not nearly as dangerous as the time he walked up a mountain, alone, in freezing temperatures with no cell service. Or as miserable as the Harrisburg bridge where he felt like the wind was slicing him in two.\n\nClose to midnight, Sestak met his day\u2019s goal, and Zandi picked him up. A large pepperoni pizza was waiting, and he quickly ate three slices \u2014 his only meal since the celery and coffee \u2014 and passed out, head slumped forward. He woke up as the car pulled into the hotel parking garage.\n\n\u201cIt was a good day,\u201d he murmured, like a self-affirmation.\n\nIn less than six hours he would start walking again. On Saturday he would reach the Ohio state line. And then, he said, he would start to run.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It could have been a metaphor for the former admiral\u2019s politics: a go-it-alone strategy that doesn\u2019t always pay off.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/colby.itkowitz", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "It could have been a metaphor for the former admiral\u2019s politics: a go-it-alone strategy that doesn\u2019t always pay off.", "title": "Joe Sestak still wants to be senator \u2014 so he walked solo across Pennsylvania", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/joe-sestak-still-wants-to-be-senator----so-he-walked-solo-across-pennsylvania/2015/04/02/1332f584-d647-11e4-b3f2-607bd612aeac_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/03/28/Others/Images/2015-03-28/COHN_SESTAK_011427558465.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@colbyitkowitz"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/joe-sestak-still-wants-to-be-senator----so-he-walked-solo-across-pennsylvania/2015/04/02/1332f584-d647-11e4-b3f2-607bd612aeac_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "joe sestak, sestak senate, sestak 2010, sestak 2016, 2010, 2016, senate race, pat toomey, toomey sestak, ed rendell, admiral sestak, admiral, rep sestak", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/colby.itkowitz"}, "eomportal-uuid": "1332f584-d647-11e4-b3f2-607bd612aeac", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "joe sestak, sestak senate, sestak 2010, sestak 2016, 2010, 2016, senate race, pat toomey, toomey sestak, ed rendell, admiral sestak, admiral, rep sestak"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5d03\"", "article_summary": "\u201cJoe Sestak will be Joe Sestak and there\u2019s some downside to that.\nJoe Sestak, the former admiral and congressman, walks through Pittsburgh on March 26, toward the end of his month-long walk across Pennsylvania.\nBut people like the folksy Joe Sestak.\nSestak calls a campaign staffer who was trying to locate him to take him to a campaign event in Pittsburgh.\n(Jason Cohn for The Washington Post)To explain why he was walking alone for 25 days and 422 miles across Pennsylvania, U.S. Senate hopeful Joe Sestak recalled a bit of advice he got six years ago."}
