Deetra Revels and Patricia Greaux of the ancillary and ambulatory workers, respectively, said union members would be unfazed if VanHouweling\u2019s compensation is higher than those who have had his position in the past.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re still worried about the future of UMC,\u201d Greaux said. \u201cWe need solid, steady leadership. It\u2019s up to our board to make sure (VanHouweling) gets a contract, and it\u2019s up to the county commissioners to make that happen.\u201d\n\nCommissioners have said the financial realities of running a public hospital present a barrier to raising the CEO\u2019s compensation significantly.\n\nO\u2019Reilly has said the board never offered VanHouweling\u2019s predecessor, Larry Barnard, a contract last year because layoffs loomed and awarding a sizable deal to the CEO during a downsizing would have been untenable.\n\nVanHouweling, UMC\u2019s chief operating officer since April, will take charge of the 541-bed facility next month when Barnard leaves to head St. Rose Dominican Hospital \u2014 San Martin campus, one of three Dignity Health acute care facilities in Southern Nevada. Barnard took the helm of UMC in January after then-CEO Brian Brannman also left for Dignity Health, where he\u2019s now vice president of operations and CEO of St. Rose Dominican Hospitals \u2014 Siena campus.\n\n\u201cThis is a very complex hospital, but there is so much upside to UMC,\u201d VanHouweling said. \u201cThere\u2019s no bigger job in the state of Nevada than running UMC.\u201d\n\nIncreasing services, ensuring the collection of all payments from insurers and agencies, and better attending to the needs of doctors and patients will help UMC improve the bottom line. VanHouweling said he is committed to reversing perceived slights of the hospital from a financial and public image perspective.\n\n\u201cI absolutely feel that we can achieve our budget,\u201d VanHouweling said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time and energy, but we have an energized team that\u2019s up to the challenge. UMC has its challenges, but nothing we can\u2019t overcome.\u201d\n\nAttracting more doctors to bring cases to UMC is a key component of VanHouweling\u2019s financial strategy. In the past year, more procedures have been performed at the hospital, and VanHouweling wants doctors and patients to know that outcomes at his hospital rival any facility in Southern Nevada.\n\n\u201cThis board is looking for results. We\u2019ve done some cost-cutting measures the past year, but we\u2019re not going to be able to cut our way to success here at UMC,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to grow the top line. We\u2019ve got to grow the business, target very specific, strategic service lines, and we\u2019ve got a plan to do that.\u201d\n\nOne such option about to be launched at UMC is the da Vinci Surgical System, which allows surgeons to operate with better vision, precision, dexterity and control through a few small incisions. MountainView Hospital last month became the first facility in Nevada to use the robotic system when Dr. Arnold Chung, a cardiovascular and thoracic surgeon, performed a thymectomy, the removal of the thymus near the base of the neck. The thymus is an organ needed early in life but much less so during adulthood.\n\n\u201cUMC is going to be bold. We\u2019re going to take risks, invest in service lines that can offset some of our expense structure,\u201d VanHouweling said. \u201cMy goal is for us to compete with any other hospital in town.\u201d\n\nAs cases increase and profits rise with new service lines to offset costs, UMC can ease the burden on taxpayers, he said. In the emergency room, efficiencies can be achieved to provide care faster without sacrificing safety. Shortening the length of time patients wait to see a doctor and reducing the number of people who simply walk out reflect how well the hospital is performing.\n\nPatients are more knowledgeable about health care because of the wealth of medical information available on the Internet and through other media. For example, robotic surgery, and specifically the da Vinci system, are being requested by people who know how minimally invasive the procedures can be, less stress to the patient and a smaller scar in the end.\n\n\u201cPeople are educating themselves, and they\u2019re seeking out that technology,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother goal is getting patients to seek preventive and primary care in physicians\u2019 offices or clinics in their neighborhoods instead of the UMC emergency room, which historically has been a place many people turn to when they have limited options for health care. With the Affordable Care Act in place, some of those patients might have other options and access to insurance unavailable until now.\n\n\u201cWe do a lot of work to help them navigate that process,\u201d VanHouweling said. \u201cWe help them get qualified or select plans so they do have choices to go to quick care or primary care, which is more appropriate for their level of service versus always relying on the (emergency room).\u201d\n\nThe 44-year-old VanHouweling is a year ahead of his career goal of being the CEO of a hospital by age 45. The University of South Florida graduate and 19-year member of the Air Force reserves also worked at Valley and Spring Valley hospitals in Las Vegas before joining UMC.\n\n\u201cThis is a very complex hospital,\u201d VanHouweling said about UMC. \u201cThis is kind of the pinnacle of health care with academic medicine, all the complex services we offer from trauma to transplants.\u201d\n\nHis focus in the coming months will be spreading the word that good things are happening and will continue at UMC.\n\n\u201cWe want patients to choose UMC over any other hospital because it is their hospital. We need their support,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a plan to reach out a lot better and align with our community.\u201d\n\nContact Steven Moore at 702-380-4563 or smoore@reviewjournal.com.", "article_metadata": {"parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/health/employees-call-leadership-3rd-umc-ceo-year", "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-1967711"}, "author": "STEVEN MOORE LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-title": "Employees call for leadership with 3rd UMC CEO in a year", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1098299519", "twitter": {"description": "Clark County and University Medical Center officials are under additional pressure to lock a leadership team into place after the selection Friday of the public hospital\u2019s third chief executive in less than a year.", "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}, "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/health/employees-call-leadership-3rd-umc-ceo-year", "image": {"src": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_web_mason_umc_mug_4.jpg"}, "title": "Employees call for leadership with 3rd UMC CEO in a year", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=2343456", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=2343456", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_web_mason_umc_mug_4.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "Clark County and University Medical Center officials are under additional pressure to lock a leadership team into place after the selection Friday of the public hospital\u2019s third chief executive in less than a year.", "title": "Employees call for leadership with 3rd UMC CEO in a year", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/health/employees-call-leadership-3rd-umc-ceo-year", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_web_mason_umc_mug_4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "parsely-author": "STEVEN MOORE LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-section": "Health", "keywords": "Health,Life, News, Las Vegas,", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-05T09:29:00-08:00"}, "parsely-pub-date": "2014-12-05T17:29:00Z", "parsely-tags": "Health,Life,News,Las Vegas", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "description": "Clark County and University Medical Center officials are under additional pressure to lock a leadership team into place after the selection Friday of the public hospital\u2019s third chief executive in less than a year."}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis is a very complex hospital, but there is so much upside to UMC,\u201d VanHouweling said.\n\u201cThis is a very complex hospital,\u201d VanHouweling said about UMC.\nPatients are more knowledgeable about health care because of the wealth of medical information available on the Internet and through other media.\n\u201cWe want patients to choose UMC over any other hospital because it is their hospital.\nAs expected, the UMC governing board selected Mason VanHouweling as CEO, choosing a career health care administrator charged with balancing patient needs with fiscal responsibility in a facility that historically has registered big deficits."}
