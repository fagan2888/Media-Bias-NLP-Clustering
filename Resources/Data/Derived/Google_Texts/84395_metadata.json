That's down from 9% last year.\n\nHMO plans should increase 8.6%, down just slightly from the previous year, according to Buck Consultants.\n\nSome insurers surveyed cited patients' lower use of medical care as the primary reason for the decreases.\n\n\"This may be a result of the economic slowdown and its impact on consumers' willingness to seek medical treatment,\" Sobel said.\n\nOverall, U.S. healthcare spending has been growing at historically low levels from 2009 to 2012, federal data show.\n\nMany health economists and industry officials have attributed the slowdown primarily to lingering effects of the Great Recession, when millions of Americans cut back on medical care.\n\nBut the Obama administration and other experts have pointed to fundamental changes in healthcare reimbursement and the delivery of care spurred by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nEven with the slowdown, the rise in health premiums continues to outpace inflation and wage growth.\n\nFor 2013, the average total cost for a family health plan rose 4% to $16,351, according to a closely watched survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research & Educational Trust.\n\nThe typical employee\u2019s share of that premium was $4,565, up about 6% from 2012. But the employer\u2019s share of the premium increased just 3%, a further sign that employers continue to shift more medical costs onto their workers.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Employer health costs to rise nearly 9% this year, survey finds", "date": "2014-05-15", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Employer healthcare costs are expected to rise nearly 9% in 2014, a slight improvement over recent years, according to a new survey.", "title": "Employer health costs to rise nearly 9% this year, survey finds", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-employer-health-costs-survey-20140515-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5374f0ef/turbine/la-fi-employer-health-costs-survey-20140515", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp16.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "healthcare, medical costs, employers", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/80210858", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "healthcare, medical costs, employers", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "Employer healthcare costs are expected to rise nearly 9% in 2014, a slight improvement over recent years, according to a new survey.
