But Bernie Sanders is disrupting Hillary Clinton\u2019s coronation on the Democratic side by channeling the party\u2019s soul, with a specifically issue-based focus.\n\nIn a way, both men are vividly illustrating a basic asymmetry that runs through American politics\u2014between left and right, liberal and conservative, Democrat and Republican\u2014which was first comprehensively described by public opinion researchers Lloyd Free and Hadley Cantril in their landmark 1967 book, \u201cThe Political Beliefs of Americans: A Study of Public Opinion,\u201d and which political scientist Matt Grossman discussed in a recent Salon interview. Free and Cantril found that half the population was ideologically conservative, in the sense of preferring a smaller, more limited government, while about two-thirds was operationally liberal, in the sense of wanting to spend more on specifically identified government programs.\n\nSubsequent research has intensified this division. Conservatives win by making broad, sweeping appeals, which can often have little relationship with the facts (Iraq\u2019s WMDs, \u201cvoter fraud,\u201d global warming denialism, etc.). Liberals win by focusing on how to fix specific problems. Thus \u201cgovernment spending\u201d in general is seen as a negative, but spending on most specific programs is strongly supported. The pattern is clear: The more practical the question, the more liberal the answers. That\u2019s just how U.S. politics works.\n\nTrump takes the conservative side of this formula to an extreme, making broad, ludicrous false claims in his narcissistically self-confident manner. What\u2019s grabbing headlines now are his false claims about illegal immigrant crime, but he remains completely detached from reality regarding Obama\u2019s citizenship as well\u2014an act of broad stigmatization that also typifies conservative thought. When NBC\u2019s Katy Tur brought up his birtherism, Trump treated her with disdain: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. According to you it\u2019s not true.\u201d When she responded straightforwardly, \u201cHe released his birth certificate,\u201d Trump doubled down on the disdain, \u201cYou know, if you believe that, that\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s an old subject.\u201d\n\nBernie Sanders is the exact opposite of Trump. As a proud self-described democratic socialist, he willingly makes himself a target for the kind of demonization that Trump hands out like candy, and he responds to attacks\u2014actual and potential\u2014by doubling down on policy specifics, where he correctly feels he\u2019s on very firm ground. In a recent interview with John Nichols in the Nation, Sanders sketched out his response to such attacks, which are now routinely leveled indiscriminately:\n\nMitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, often criticizes President Obama, incorrectly, for trying to push \u201cEuropean-style socialism,\u201d and McConnell says the American people don\u2019t want it. First of all, of course, Obama is not trying to push European-style socialism. Second of all, I happen to believe that, if the American people understood the significant accomplishments that have taken place under social-democratic governments, democratic-socialist governments, labor governments throughout Europe, they would be shocked to know about those accomplishments. One of the goals of this campaign is to advance that understanding\u2026. How many Americans know that in virtually every European country, when you have a baby, you get guaranteed time off and, depending on the country, significant financial benefits as well. Do the American people know that? I doubt it. Do the American people even know that we\u2019re the only major Western industrialized country that doesn\u2019t guarantee healthcare for all? Most people don\u2019t know that. Do the American people know that in many countries throughout Europe, public colleges and universities are either tuition-free or very inexpensive? I have always believed that the countries in Scandinavia have not gotten the kind of honest recognition they deserve for the extraordinary achievements they have made.\n\nSanders is right to think that Scandanavian socialism would be popular here in the U.S., if only people knew more about it. And he\u2019s right to make spreading that awareness a goal of his campaign. In fact, on a wide range of issue specifics Sanders lines up with strong majorities of public opinion\u2014and has for decades.\n\nYou can get a strong sense of this from the results of the \u201cBig Ideas\u201d poll commissioned by the Progressive Change Institute in January, which has thus far gotten far less attention than it deserves. (Full disclosure: I\u2019m a former blogmate with Adam Green, co-founder of PCI\u2019s affiliate, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.) PCI first solicited ideas online through an open submission process (more than 2,600 specific proposals were submitted) and then let people vote on them (more than a million votes were cast). This bottom-up process was then tested out in a national poll. The following all received 70% support or more:\n\nAllow Government to Negotiate Drug Prices (79%)\n\nGive Students the Same Low Interest Rates as Big Banks (78%)\n\nUniversal Pre-Kindergarten (77%)\n\nFair Trade that Protect Workers, the Environment, and Jobs (75%)\n\nEnd Tax Loopholes for Corporations that Ship Jobs Overseas (74%)\n\nEnd Gerrymandering (73%)\n\nLet Homeowners Pay Down Mortgage With 401k (72%)\n\nDebt-Free College at All Public Universities (Message A) (71%)\n\nInfrastructure Jobs Program \u2014 $400 Billion / Year (71%)\n\nRequire NSA to Get Warrants (71%)\n\nDisclose Corporate Spending on Politics/Lobbying (71%)\n\nMedicare Buy-In for All (71%)\n\nClose Offshore Corporate Tax Loopholes (70%)\n\nGreen New Deal \u2014 Millions Of Clean-Energy Jobs (70%)\n\nFull Employment Act (70%)\n\nExpand Social Security Benefits (70%)\n\nAll of the above are in line with Bernie Sanders\u2019 politics and all are extremely popular, with support across the political spectrum. For example, the infrastructure jobs program (a key element of Sanders\u2019 platform) had 91% support from Democrats, 61% from independents and even 55% support from Republicans\u2014compared to only 28% who were opposed. Donald Trump can only dream of being that popular among Republicans.\n\nOne could easily write a whole story about Sanders\u2019 strength on issues based on this one poll alone. It\u2019s astonishing to see all these ideas brought together which have strong support among the American people, but which can barely get the time of day in the top-down world of U.S. politics today. And that, arguably, goes straight to the heart of what the Sanders campaign is all about\u2014opening up the political process to popular ideas that just happen to be not so popular with the billionaire class, and the political system that caters so slavishly to them.\n\nBut that\u2019s not to say there\u2019s no other evidence of how popular Sanders\u2019 views are. At the American Prospect, Peter Drier recently pulled together a broad sampling of the evidence that Sanders represents majority views on a core set of issues. For example, one of the European-style socialist practices that\u2019s particularly popular is paid leave:\n\nEighty percent of Americans favor requiring employers to offer paid leave to parents of new children and employees caring for sick family members. Even more (85 percent) favor requiring employers to offer paid leave to employees who are ill.\n\nDrier broke the issues down as follows: big business, progressive taxation, inequality and poverty, money in politics, minimum wage and workers\u2019 rights, health care and social security, higher education, same-sex marriage. His general method was to cite a number of different sources illustrating different aspects of the issue.\n\nRegarding big business, to take one example, Drier notes that 74 percent of Americans believe corporations have too much influence on American life and politics today (New York Times/CBS News), 60 percent of Americans\u2014including 75 percent of Democrats\u2014believe that \u201cthe economic system in this country unfairly favors the wealthy\u201d (Pew), and 58% of Americans said they support breaking up \u201cbig banks like Citigroup\u201d (the PCI poll, cited by the Wall Street Journal), which Drier points out is \u201ca key plank of Sanders\u2019 platform and the goal of a bill that Sanders sponsored in the Senate.\u201d He also notes that 73% of Americans favor tougher rules for Wall Street financial companies (Lake Research), and finally, that 64% favor regulating greenhouse gas emissions and requiring utilities to generate more power from \u201cclean\u201d low-carbon sources (Duke University).\n\nWhat this shows is that Sanders is not simply cherry-picking a few popular ideas here and there. He\u2019s tapping into a broadly shared set of inter-related attitudes and ideas about closely related issues Although these views and ideas are usually sidelined in most political discourse, the convergence of attitudes into a coherent policy texture is remarkably consistent. And this gets to a primary problem with America\u2019s political system: liberal policy views form a coherent whole, every bit as much as conservative ones do, but they are far less publicly recognized, articulated, discussed and explored\u2014despite the fact that they are wildly popular!\n\nAs I\u2019ve noted before here at Salon, Free and Cantril commented on this situation in the last section of their book \u201cThe Need for a Restatement of American Ideology\u201d almost 50 years ago:\n\nThe paradox of a large majority of Americans qualifying as operational liberals while at the same time a majority hold to a conservative ideology has been repeatedly emphasized in this study. We have described this state of affairs as mildly schizoid, with people believing in one set of principles abstractly while acting according to another set of principles in their political behavior. But the principles according to which the majority of Americans actually behave politically have not yet been adequately formulated in modern terms \u2026 There is little doubt that the time has come for a restatement of American ideology to bring it in line with what the great majority of people want and approve. Such a statement, with the right symbols incorporated, would focus people\u2019s wants, hopes, and beliefs, and provide a guide and platform to enable the American people to implement their political desires in a more intelligent, direct, and consistent manner.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trump channels the right's angry Fox News id.
