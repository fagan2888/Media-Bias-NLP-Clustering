After reading this, I wonder if I\u2019ve got it all wrong. Was he pushed out or did he resign in protest because they insisted on launching a site that he knew wasn\u2019t secure?\n\nWhen asked whether he jumped or was pushed, HHS said simply that \u201cTony [Trenkle] made a decision that he was going to move to the private sector.\u201d Memo to Darrell Issa: Subpoena this man.\n\nCBS News has learned that [Tony] Trenkle, the Chief Information Officer for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), was originally supposed to sign off on security for the glitch-ridden website before its Oct. 1 launch, but didn\u2019t. Instead, the authorization on September 27 was given by Trenkle\u2019s boss, CMS administrator Marilyn Tavenner\u2026 Trenkle and two other CMS officials, including Chief Operating Officer Michelle Snyder, signed an unusual \u201crisk acknowledgement\u201d saying that the agency\u2019s mitigation plan for rigorous monitoring and ongoing tests did \u201cnot reduce the (security) risk to the \u2026 system itself going into operation on October 1, 2013.\u201d\u2026 Wednesday, an HHS spokesman said that the reason Tavenner, not Trenkle, signed the security authorization is because HealthCare.gov is \u201ca high-profile project and CMS felt it warranted having the administrator sign the authority to operate memo.\u201d HHS also says there is an aggressive risk mitigation plan in effect, \u201cthe privacy and security of consumers personal information is a top priority for us\u201d and personal information is \u201cprotected by stringent security standards.\u201d\n\nSo Trenkle wanted to sign the authority memo for a site he knew hadn\u2019t been tested for security end-to-end and was guaranteed to malfunction once it came under a heavy traffic load? He hoped and dreamed to put his John Hancock on this trainwreck \u2014 but Tavenner decided to selflessly take responsibility for the looming disaster by signing it herself? That seems \u2026 unlikely. Tell me if this sounds more plausible: Tavenner asks Trenkle to sign and he politely refuses. The site\u2019s not secure, after all, and not only is it not secure but trying to repair it on the fly is bound to create even more security holes. Because he\u2019s a good soldier and wants the site to work, though, he sticks around for another month and does his best to help fix things. A month later, for reasons as yet unknown, he finally abandons ship.\n\nCould be, I guess, that Trenkle was so incompetent that he didn\u2019t realize the extent of the security problems, but that doesn\u2019t jibe with his assessment in the \u201crisk acknowledgment\u201d mentioned in the excerpt above. It also doesn\u2019t jibe with the nearly universal opinion among tech experts who\u2019ve been quoted in the media that launching a site without end-to-end testing for security is unorthodox, especially one as prominent as this:\n\n\u201cThe best scenario is to have done end-to-end testing,\u201d said Lisa Gallagher, vice president of technology solutions for the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, a medical technology nonprofit. That it wasn\u2019t done \u201cwould cause me some mild concern,\u201d she continued, adding she would advise a relative or close friend to wait until the website is stabilized before plunging in. Asked former White House chief information officer Theresa Payton, \u201cIf you haven\u2019t done end-to-end testing, how can we say with certainty how hard or easy it is for cybercriminals to attack at different points in the process?\u201d \u201cIt makes me shudder a little,\u201d said Payton, a former bank security executive who now has her own company.\n\nAt least one tech consultant thinks \u201cIt would be very surprising if there isn\u2019t some type of breach, either at the federal or state level, by this time next year.\u201d Exit question: Per the AP, Tavenner testified a few days ago that she didn\u2019t voice the concerns about security at CMS to either Sebelius or the White House. In that case, why hasn\u2019t she been fired?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Scapegoat?", "title": "Chief tech officer at HHS resigns \u2014 after failing to sign off on security for Healthcare.gov in September", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/11/07/chief-tech-officer-at-hhs-resigns-after-failing-to-sign-off-on-security-for-healthcare-gov-in-september/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-07T19:41:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-07T19:46:51+00:00"}, "keywords": "healthcare.gov, ObamaCare, sebelius, security, tavenner, trenkle,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0d0b\"", "article_summary": "Tell me if this sounds more plausible: Tavenner asks Trenkle to sign and he politely refuses.\nWas he pushed out or did he resign in protest because they insisted on launching a site that he knew wasn\u2019t secure?\nCBS News has learned that [Tony] Trenkle, the Chief Information Officer for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), was originally supposed to sign off on security for the glitch-ridden website before its Oct. 1 launch, but didn\u2019t.\nAfter reading this, I wonder if I\u2019ve got it all wrong.\nBecause he\u2019s a good soldier and wants the site to work, though, he sticks around for another month and does his best to help fix things."}
