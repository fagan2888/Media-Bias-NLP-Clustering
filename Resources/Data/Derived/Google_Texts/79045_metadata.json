It is among the bottom 10 countries for life expectancy, according to a new report\n\nMen and women living in the US can expect to live until the age of 78.8 - ranking the nation 27th out of 34 in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, a new analysis reveals\n\nLife expectancy at birth measures how long someone born today would live if current mortality rates continued to apply.\n\nIn reality, improvements in medicine means that age spans are likely to increase over time.\n\nAverage lifespan across all nations reached 80.5 years in 2013, an increase of more than 10 years since 1970.\n\nA persistent gap in life expectancy between women, who live longer, and men has gradually narrowed from about seven years to five, the study found.\n\nJapan - at 83.4 years - along with Switzerland and Spain topped the charts for life expectancy in 2013, followed by Italy, France and Australia, according to the annual overview of health metrics.\n\nAt the bottom of the 34-strong ranking were Slovakia, Hungary and, in last place, Mexico, where life expectancy was nine years less than in Japan or Spain.\n\nThe obesity rate among adults in the United States is the highest of all OECD countries, with the rate reaching 36.5 per cent in 2010\n\nSeveral factors account for the poor and declining life expectancy in the US, the report said, starting with its weak public health sector and the millions of Americans who remain uninsured.\n\nHigh income inequality, illegal drug use, along with high rates of obesity, traffic accidents and homicide also push average life spans down.\n\nLooking at major risk factors -- smoking, alcohol and obesity -- the US ranked last on the obesity index, but was among healthiest nations for tobacco consumption.\n\nLIFE EXPECTANCY LEAGUE TABLE Country Life expectancy 1 Switzerland 82.8 2 Japan 82.7 3 Italy 82.7 4 Spain 82.4 5 Iceland 82.4 6 France 82.2 7 Australia 82.0 8 Sweden 81.9 9 Israel 81.8 10 Norway 81.4 11 Netherlands 81.3 12 New Zealand 81.2 13 Luxembourg 81.1 14 Austria 81.1 15 UK 81.1 16 Korea 81.1 17 Canada 81.0 18 Germany 80.8 19 Greece 80.8 20 Portugal 80.8 21 Finland 80.6 22 Ireland 80.6 23 Belgium 80.5 24 Slovenia 80.1 OECD average 80.1 25 Denmark 79.9 26 US 78.7 27 Chile 78.3 28 Czech Rep 78.0 29 Poland 76.9 30 Estonia 76.3 31 Slovak Rep 76.1 32 Hungary 75.0 33 Turkey 74.6 34 Mexico 74.2 Source: OCED\n\nAustria, Estonia, France and Hungary scored very poorly across two risk categories: smoking and drinking.\n\nHungarians were the only people to seriously overindulge in all three.\n\nSweden and Norway were the only countries among the 34 in which all three risk factors remained very low.\n\nIn analysing a range of other health habits of OECD member nations, the report revealed people living in Japan and Italy were virtuous when it came to alcohol and overeating, but fell into the middle of the pack regarding smoking.\n\nTobacco intake showed a surprising variation across nations.\n\nIceland is the only country in which more women smoked than men, but the overall rate of tobacco consumption was among the lowest among rich countries.\n\nThe largest disparity among OECD nations was in South Korea, where some 37 per cent of men smoked, and less than five per cent of women.\n\nAmong non-OECD countries included in the report, more than 70 per cent of men in Indonesia consumed tobacco compared to three per cent of women.\n\nAfter Indonesia, the countries with the highest rate of smoking among men were Latvia, China, Russia and Greece.\n\nAnother category with large differences across countries and between sexes was suicide.\n\nThe countries with the lowest rates of suicide - at seven or fewer per 100,000 people - were Turkey, Greece, Mexico, Italy and Israel.\n\nThe country with the highest percentage by far of people taking their own lives was South Korea, which averaged 30 per 100,000 people.\n\nFor men, however, that figure shot up to nearly 45 per 100,000.\n\nIn all nations, the rate of suicide among women was at least twice as low as for men, and in many cases several times lower.\n\nThe report's authors note: 'The US health care system performs very well in the area of cancer care, achieving higher rates of screening and survival for several types of cancer than most other developed countries.\n\n'However, the United States performs badly in preventing costly hospital admissions for chronic conditions, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or diabetes, which should normally be managed through proper primary care.\n\n'The obesity rate among adults in the United States is the highest of all OECD countries, with the rate reaching 36.5 per cent in 2010, up from 30.7 per cent in 2000.\n\n'This is more than twice as high as the OECD average, although the obesity rate in several countries is under-estimated because it is based on selfreports of height and weight.\n\n'As is the case in several other countries, the obesity rate in the United States tends to be higher among disadvantaged socio-economic groups, especially in women.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "10,year,jump,life,expectancy,rich,nations,US,lags", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3303398/10-year-jump-life-expectancy-rich-nations-US-lags.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Men and women living in the US can expect to live until the age of 78 -
