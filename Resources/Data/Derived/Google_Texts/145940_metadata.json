Police killings of unarmed black citizens and the rise of the #BlackLivesMatter movement have pushed the president in the right direction, along with a steady undercurrent of principled black criticism.\n\nIt is easy to understand the president\u2019s initial hesitation to engage race. The last thing he wanted to do, initially, was offer the nation a self-portrait of presidential leadership that drew exclusively from color. The right wing had made furious efforts to demonize him as a man unworthy of assuming the mantle of national leadership. The assaults from political figures who portrayed him as a cipher, or a monkey or, later, the police officers who cracked jokes at his expense, proved the toxic atmosphere.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI am subject to constant criticism all day long,\u201d the president told me in an Oval Office interview back in 2010. \u201cAnd some of it may be legitimate; much of it may be illegitimate. Some of it may be sincere; some of it may be entirely politically motivated. If I spent all my time thinking about it, I\u2019d be paralyzed. And frankly the voters would justifiably say, \u2018I need somebody who\u2019s focused on giving me a job, not whether his feelings are hurt.\u2019 \u201d Mr. Obama said then that a great deal of the resistance he faced from the Tea Party had more to do with anti-government emotions rather than strict racial animus, even as he understood how the two intertwined. \u201cAre there probably elements within that movement that focus on my race? I think that\u2019s probably the case. I don\u2019t remember any other president who was challenged about where he was born despite having a birth certificate.\u201d\n\nThe president often practiced the politics of racial sublimation: He took the energy of race and redistributed it over the political landscape in a host of racially neutral projects \u2014 Obamacare, primarily \u2014 which could have racial benefits without an overt message of aiming policy at minority communities. This was an uneasy alliance of amnesia and avoidance, and no matter the surface calm, racial tensions were percolating beneath. When they erupted in police killings and black resistance, Mr. Obama\u2019s path to public proclamation was cleared.\n\nBracing racial rhetoric, in tandem with targeted public policy, can make a big difference in how race is lived. The president has already made a push for prison reform. In his N.A.A.C.P. address, he argued that instead of devoting $80 billion to incarceration, we could invest in pre-K and jobs for teenagers, both of which would return the investment far more grandly than a life diminished behind bars.\n\nMr. Obama has also sought to aggressively enforce legal bans on residential discrimination \u2014 making cities accountable for the use of federal housing funds to reduce racial disparities. He has finally become more willing to grant pardons to prisoners who were often unjustly saddled with life sentences for nonviolent drug offenses.\n\nAnd in light of the hostilities between minority groups and the police, the president summoned a group to recommend incremental changes, some of which he adopted, such as the call for body cameras. Each effort is commendable and in some ways overdue. But something bigger is called for.\n\nWe need a new Kerner Commission report that is updated for our day, paying special attention to how black people are viciously targeted by unethical police practices. It\u2019s true that calling for a commission might not seem like the most systematic fix. But a serious investment in assessing the state of inequality and systemic racism in America \u2014 numbers behind the trends the president spoke about when he eloquently eulogized the slain Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney in Charleston, S.C., in June \u2014 will show us clearly what work is left. And it will be harder to ignore, less ephemeral than mourning or protests.\n\nIn our conversation several years ago, the president told me that he aimed to speak about values that everyone could rally around. \u201cAt its base what\u2019s always been strongest about the civil rights movement has been when it said, \u2018Yes, there is a unique problem here that arises out of race and slavery and segregation. But when you lock us up, you\u2019re imprisoning yourself in some fashion,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nLast November, the nation saw the spectacle of a black president giving a news conference on one side of a television split screen while in Ferguson, tear gas and sirens swirled around a crowd protesting the failure of a grand jury to indict a police officer in the death of an unarmed black teenager. Mr. Obama was stern, his gaunt visage strained by the relentless thrum of events, events that possessed a remorseless logic of black suffering as their end.\n\nThe president appeared to be, as he had often stated, not the president of black America, but, instead, the president of the United States, which seemed to be disuniting as he spoke.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the months since, he has found a way to be both the president of all America while speaking with special urgency on life for black Americans. When Mr. Obama is free to tell the truth about race and the condition of black America, he is free to be the best president he can be.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150801143007, "twitter": {"description": "How our first black president can leave black Americans better off.", "title": "President Obama\u2019s Racial Renaissance", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/opinion/sunday/president-obamas-racial-renaissance.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003826991"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/02/opinion/sunday/02dysonSUB/02dysonSUB-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/opinion/sunday/president-obamas-racial-renaissance.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003826991", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/opinion/sunday/president-obamas-racial-renaissance.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/sunday", "hdl_p": "President Obama\u2019s Racial Renaissance", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Aug. 1, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Obama  Barack,Blacks,Police Brutality  Misconduct and Shootings,Race and Ethnicity,United States Politics and Government", "news_keywords": "Blacks African-Americans", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Michael Eric Dyson", "SCG": "sunday", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By MICHAEL ERIC DYSON", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "How our first black president can leave black Americans better off.", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "CT": "column", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/02/opinion/sunday/02dysonSUB/02dysonSUB-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/02/opinion/sunday/02dysonSUB/02dysonSUB-thumbLarge.jpg", "description": "How our first black president can leave black Americans better off.", "CN": "michael-eric-dyson", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Aug. 1, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "article": {"author": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/michael-eric-dyson", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-10-01", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "United States Politics and Government", "published": "2015-08-01", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "02dyson", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20151001070006, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/opinion/sunday/president-obamas-racial-renaissance.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/02/opinion/sunday/02dysonSUB/02dysonSUB-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "How our first black president can leave black Americans better off.", "title": "President Obama\u2019s Racial Renaissance"}, "pdate": 20150801, "des": "United States Politics and Government", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "opinion", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/michael-eric-dyson", "tagline": "Race, politics, religion and culture.", "uri": "/column/michael-eric-dyson", "display-name": "Michael Eric Dyson", "identifier": "michael-eric-dyson", "type": "column"}, "articleid": 100000003826991, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "President Obama\u2019s Racial Renaissance", "col": "Contributing Op-Ed Writer", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "article_summary": "The president appeared to be, as he had often stated, not the president of black America, but, instead, the president of the United States, which seemed to be disuniting as he spoke.\nWhen Mr. Obama is free to tell the truth about race and the condition of black America, he is free to be the best president he can be.\nMr. Obama has also sought to aggressively enforce legal bans on residential discrimination \u2014 making cities accountable for the use of federal housing funds to reduce racial disparities.\nWhen they erupted in police killings and black resistance, Mr. Obama\u2019s path to public proclamation was cleared.\nThis was an uneasy alliance of amnesia and avoidance, and no matter the surface calm, racial tensions were percolating beneath."}
