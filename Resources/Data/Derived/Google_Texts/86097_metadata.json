He avoided significant brain damage, but the accident destroyed Westrom\u2019s optic nerve, leaving the 14-year-old permanently blind.\n\nBut it was baling season, and the family was a man short on the farm.\n\n\u201cI remember my dad needing somebody to either drive the baler tractor or work the hay rack, and it wasn\u2019t going to work for me to drive,\u201d Westrom said. That would be the first of many summers Westrom would spend sightlessly throwing bales of hay.\n\nSaid Westrom: \u201cWhen others have an expectation of you, you can have it of yourself a lot easier. You\u2019re willing to find a way to make it happen or get it done.\u201d\n\nNow the Republican state senator and married father of three from Elbow Lake has taken on another challenge \u2014 attempting to unseat veteran Rep. \u00adCollin Peterson in the Seventh Congressional District, which spans a large swath of western Minnesota from the Canadian border nearly to Iowa.\n\nPeterson is among the most formidable of the state\u2019s congressional delegation. For a dozen terms he has won handily in an otherwise Republican-leaning district. He is a Democrat who occasionally votes with the other side, particularly on fiscal issues. He is a zealous advocate for rural issues and the ranking member of the House Agriculture Committee, giving his sparsely populated district an outsized influence in an organization that runs on seniority. In 2012, Peterson won with more than 60 percent of the vote.\n\nWestrom, who has served 18 years in the Legislature, said of Peterson, \u201cI am David, he\u2019s Goliath, we all know that. But I always like the outcome of that story.\u201d\n\nWestrom is the first known blind member of the Minnesota Legislature and the first blind speaker pro tem in the nation. He jumped from the House to Senate in 2013 and hadn\u2019t completed his first term when he announced he would take on Peterson. He\u2019s received solid backing from the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), who promoted him and Eighth District challenger Stewart Mills to the top of its Young Guns program \u2014 an indication that they are expected to pose a significant threat to incumbents.\n\nWestrom raised $466,538 through the end of July, while the NRCC has reserved more than $2.8 million in television advertising in the Seventh District, with the first ad expected to debut this week. It\u2019s a big investment in a race against an incumbent who hasn\u2019t faced a significant challenge in nearly two decades.\n\nTyler Q. Houlton, deputy policy director and policy press secretary for the NRCC, called Westrom \u201ca very dynamic candidate \u2026 with a really compelling story to tell that\u2019s resonating with voters. I think Peterson\u2019s in for a rude awakening.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee does not list Peterson on its Frontline Program, which is designed to protect vulnerable incumbents. The Washington-based Cook Political Report rates the Seventh as leaning Democratic.\n\nStarting young\n\nWestrom first won a state House seat in 1996, at 23. While working at the Capitol he also ran his own forage baling and rental property business and attended law school at night. Westrom said he does not want to be defined by his condition \u2014 but also isn\u2019t afraid to use it to unite a room. A few years back, he was in the speaker\u2019s chair during a contentious House debate when someone asked for a roll-call vote. Westrom seized the moment.\n\n\u201cSeeing 11 hands, there will be a roll call,\u201d he cracked from the podium, to roars of laughter in the chamber.\n\nWestrom counts among his standout moments a bill he sponsored to extend radioactive waste storage at the \u00adPrairie Island nuclear plant in Red Wing. He said the effort benefited the economy and renewable energy, although the local tribal community argued \u00adheavily against it.\n\nDuring his time in the Legislature, he\u2019s been a reliable conservative vote, opposing state-funded abortions, same-sex marriage and last year\u2019s income tax increase on the state\u2019s highest wage earners. He has supported ending the moratorium on nuclear power plants and requiring photo ID at the polls. He has voted against funding stem cell research and for alternative teacher licensing.\n\nOn the trail, Westrom expounds on the need for the Keystone XL pipeline, saying the delays are driving up oil transportation costs for farmers and affecting grain shipping from his district. Environmentalists have said the project could damage fragile ecosystems and create the potential for oil spills.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about grain and propane, and how this is negatively affecting voters and families,\u201d Westrom said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important, and people can\u2019t understand why the leadership continues to falter.\u201d\n\nAt a candidate forum earlier this summer, Westrom criticized the Obama administration for the \u201cunacceptable\u201d Keystone bottleneck. Peterson said the Keystone XL needs to be built, but said a pipeline from North Dakota\u2019s oil-rich Bakken fields to Duluth should be the priority. In the meantime, Peterson said, railroads were working to improve capacity.\n\nIf he won, Westrom would cut a different figure from the millionaires who typically populate Congress. An attorney who with his wife owns and operates a real estate rental property business, Westrom carries tens of thousands of dollars in personal debt for both student loans and credit cards and has a declared income of a little over $50,000, according to his personal financial disclosure statement.\n\nHealth care, taxes a concern\n\nOn a recent summer afternoon, Westrom strolled into Myron Larson\u2019s insurance office in downtown Alexandria, where the two warmly greeted each other. Larson expressed frustration with the Affordable Care Act, calling it \u201ca real hollow law.\u201d\n\nDown the street, at Cowing Robards, a mainstay sporting goods and screen printing shop, Westrom chatted with owner Dan Rooney, who said taxes and the cost of doing business make it hard to raise his employees\u2019 wages.\n\nRooney told Westrom, \u201cI don\u2019t mind paying my share, but I want proper representation on those taxes when they\u2019re being spent.\u201d\n\nLarson and Rooney both said they\u2019re backing Westrom. But Hal Miller, an employee at Alex Tailoring, is undecided.\n\n\u201cI think the whole thing is totally dysfunctional,\u201d Miller said of Congress. \u201cThe world \u2026 works on compromise and they seem to be the only people that don\u2019t understand that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "First blind member of Legislature runs for Congress.", "title": "'Young Gun' Torrey Westrom hopes to stir up 7th District race", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/young-gun-torrey-westrom-hopes-to-stir-up-7th-district-race/274287161/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141014397774835.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141014397774835.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "First blind member of Legislature runs for Congress.", "title": "'Young Gun' Torrey Westrom hopes to stir up 7th District race", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/young-gun-torrey-westrom-hopes-to-stir-up-7th-district-race/274287161/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141014397774835.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141014397774835.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "First blind member of Legislature runs for Congress."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fded34\"", "article_summary": "If he won, Westrom would cut a different figure from the millionaires who typically populate Congress.\nIn 2012, Peterson won with more than 60 percent of the vote.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important, and people can\u2019t understand why the leadership continues to falter.\u201dAt a candidate forum earlier this summer, Westrom criticized the Obama administration for the \u201cunacceptable\u201d Keystone bottleneck.\nIn the late summer of 1987, a teenage Torrey Westrom was still expecting the lights to go back on.\nWestrom raised $466,538 through the end of July, while the NRCC has reserved more than $2.8 million in television advertising in the Seventh District, with the first ad expected to debut this week."}
