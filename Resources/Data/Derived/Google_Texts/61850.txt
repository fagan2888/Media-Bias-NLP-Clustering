Cher rants against Rand Paul on Twitter, her fans respond with calls for her to run for president in 2016

Thrown in between tweets about toothaches, costumes and pool time, Cher decided to rant about Sen. Rand Paul on Twitter Friday night.

It was not clear what prompted the Twitter tirade. Cher had just finished giving an update on her toothache and five new “unbelievable” costumes when she switched gears.

Mediaite postulated that she may have tweeted the comments about the 2016 presidential hopeful while watching “The Rachel Maddow Show.” Maddow featured a six minute segment Friday night on the Kentucky senator’s “lies” that Maddow attempted to prove with a 2010 clip from her own show.

Either way it seems that Cher’s Twitter fanbase doesn’t know or care about Rand Paul or the singer’s thoughts on him.

Her tweets were met with responses ranging from “I’ve no idea who is he 0~o” to “Would you be president if you got the offer ?”

Apparently it’s Cher for president in 2016. America believes in life after love.
