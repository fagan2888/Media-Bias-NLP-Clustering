The Tulsa Police Department says A&E’s popular reality show “The First 48” will start filming the Tulsa Police Department’s homicide investigators this week.

The show chronicles homicide detectives investigating murders.

The department says A&E’s cameras will follow TPD's homicide investigators working during the hours immediately following a murder. Police say “The First 48” crews will stay with the investigators for the duration of the investigation.

“The show will bring positive exposure by demonstrating the detectives’ tireless dedication to solve the case and the compassion they have for the families involved,” said Tulsa Police Chief Chuck Jordan.

Jordan says the show will provide an inside look into real-life murder investigations.

Tulsa Police said residents who are near a homicide scene will be asked whether they agree to be filmed and no resident will be filmed who does not wish to be.
