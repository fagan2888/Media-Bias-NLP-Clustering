That meant leaving his band of brothers: vocalist Jonathan Davis, bassist Reggie \u201cFieldy\u201d Arvizu, guitarist James \u201cMunky\u201d Shaffer and former drummer David Silveria. But Welch, now sober and a born-again Christian, had other priorities, specifically his then-5-year-old daughter, Jeanne.\n\n\u201cWhen I walked away, I didn\u2019t care about any of it,\u201d he said during a recent phone interview at a tour stop in Toronto. \u201cI just wanted to raise my daughter right and get my life together. I also wanted to see how real this God stuff was. I raised my daughter \u2013 I\u2019d take her to school and I tried to become just a normal dude.\u201d\n\nFitting in proved to be difficult, he adds, as his dreadlocks and tattooed arms often caused other parents to call the principal of his daughter\u2019s school to report \u201csome weird freak\u201d hanging out in the parking lot. \u201cThe principal would say, \u2018That\u2019s just Brian and he\u2019s a sweetheart,\u2019\u201d he recalls with a laugh.\n\nIt was his daughter that initially led him out of Korn, but last year it was also she who helped him back in. Now a teenager, Jeanne persuaded her dad to take her to see Korn live. He hesitatingly agreed, but after reconnecting with his old mates, he ended up joining them on stage for the first time in seven years during the song \u201cBlind.\u201d\n\n\u201cA week later, I got the call,\u201d Welch says of being invited back into the group. \u201cThe managers had been asking me over the years to come back and I had said no, because that was about business. When it became more about friendship, it was like, \u2018OK, this is supposed to happen.\u2019 Now that I\u2019m back, it\u2019s like a gift I wasn\u2019t even looking for, because I was already done.\u201d\n\nWith Welch back in the mix, the band headed into Buck Owens Studios in Bakersfield to begin work on its 11th studio album, The Paradigm Shift, which drops Tuesday. Welch isn\u2019t the only member of Korn to free himself from demons: he shares that the entire band is now living clean and that this release marks the first time the group recorded with clear heads.\n\n\u201cThe chemistry came back right away,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was just there and it kept building that whole first week. It was almost perfect. It was just friends having fun.\n\n\u201cWe were just jacked before. That\u2019s what drugs do. At first it was cool \u2013 you\u2019re all wacked out and writing songs, and you\u2019re like \u2018oh cool, trippy.\u2019 And the next thing you know, the drugs are stealing your creativity, your mind, your emotions \u2013 and then you\u2019re in the gutter. Luckily for us, we were given a second chance.\u201d\n\nThe band is currently playing a series of album-launch gigs, which kicked off Sept. 26 in Philadelphia and stops at the Wiltern in Los Angeles for a sold-out show on Thursday before closing out in Las Vegas on Oct. 12. Welch says the new material, which has received a positive response from fans, is fitting well within the set. The fresh cuts, he says, sound a lot like \u201cold Korn.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still just as crazy as we were before,\u201d he says. \u201cThe funny thing is that people would think we were drunk now because of the way we act all of the time.\u201d\n\nHe admits that there were occasions in the past when the band couldn\u2019t wait to be done performing so they could go directly to the after-party. Now that they are sober and their focus has shifted toward family, the show has become more of a priority. \u201cWe all came into it this time with clear minds. We\u2019re all feeling the new music \u2013 that\u2019s our new high, now that we\u2019ve gotten our lives together.\u201d\n\nWith the album\u2019s release just days away, Welch says they\u2019re excited to share it with fans. He also notes how working with producer Don Gilmore, who previously helmed records by Linkin Park, Hollywood Undead and Lacuna Coil, was \u201ca perfect choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe knew how to get the job done and it worked out really well,\u201d he continues. \u201cHe worked on Pearl Jam\u2019s Ten (as an engineer) and produced Linkin Park\u2019s Hybrid Theory so we knew that he knew his stuff. There was a level of respect there that was pretty high.\u201d\n\nWelch says Korn still has a lot of love for Orange County, although Arvizu is the only member still residing in the area. Welch has lived in Nashville since 2001, when he sold his three-story home just off Pacific Coast Highway.\n\n\u201cI still love going to Huntington and seeing all of my friends,\u201d he says. \u201cI love going down to my friend\u2019s place, Sancho\u2019s Tacos. It\u2019s like a happening spot down there. I just don\u2019t go down there to party anymore.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "blogs", "description": "Soundcheck: Korn shucks destructive ways with new disc", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "author": "KELLI SKYE FADROSKI, ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER", "og": {"url": "http://www.ocregister.com/soundcheck/welch-529484-says-korn.html", "locale": "en-US", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/mu5s4m-webkorn2.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Korn shucks destructive ways with new disc"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/mu5s4m-webkorn2.jpg"}, "site": "@ocregister", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Korn shucks destructive ways with new disc"}, "publication_date": "2013-10-04", "content_author": "KELLI SKYE FADROSKI, ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER", "fb": {"app_id": 107698536003308}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/thumb/mu5s4m-webkorn2.jpg", "content_type": "article", "ICBM": "33.745573, -117.867834", "Keywords": "welch, says, korn, band, daughter, time, first, done, member, new, paradigm, shift, jonathan, davis, brian, head, welch, wiltern, theatre, los, angeles, preview, interview,", "geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "access-type": "free", "section": "blogs", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "content_title": "Korn shucks destructive ways with new disc"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddeea\"", "article_summary": "In 2005, Brian \u201cHead\u201d Welch, guitarist and original member of Korn, walked away from it all.\nIt was his daughter that initially led him out of Korn, but last year it was also she who helped him back in.\nBut Welch, now sober and a born-again Christian, had other priorities, specifically his then-5-year-old daughter, Jeanne.\nThat meant leaving his band of brothers: vocalist Jonathan Davis, bassist Reggie \u201cFieldy\u201d Arvizu, guitarist James \u201cMunky\u201d Shaffer and former drummer David Silveria.\n\u201cWhen I walked away, I didn\u2019t care about any of it,\u201d he said during a recent phone interview at a tour stop in Toronto."}
