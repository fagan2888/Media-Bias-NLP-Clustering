Mr. Leonhardt notes that no society can flourish if that continues to be the case.\n\nThe two capitalistic systems he cites that are doing significantly better than the United States, with rising wages and improved economic status and outlook for the middle class, are Canada and Australia. Factors that Mr. Leonhardt mentions are that both have better mass educational systems, more generous child care and family leave, and better job training through education.\n\nWhat Mr. Leonhardt fails to cite is that America does not have universal government-sponsored basic health care, as do both Canada and Australia. Data from the Commonwealth Fund indicates that their health care costs per capita are less than half those in the United States. Not only does this contribute to a sense of prosperity, but there is also a significant correlation of basic health care with a sense of well-being. Good health is a necessary underpinning for educational potential and achievement.\n\nAmerica must close this gap and develop universal health care to benefit our ailing middle class and poor. The Affordable Care Act is a step in this direction.\n\nCAROL C. NADELSON\n\nHOWARD A.
