Michigan plans are available on the federal healthcare.gov site.\n\nThere are a wide variety of plans available on the marketplace, ranging from platinum coverage that covers about 90 percent of health care expensive to just catastrophic coverage.\n\nTo benchmark the rate increases, the federal government looked at the cost of every state's second least expensive silver plan, near the middle of the possible range. Josh Fangmeier, senior health policy analyst with the Center for Healthcare Research & Transformation, said 70 percent of people using the exchange chose silver plans.\n\nIn Michigan, that benchmark plan went up by 1.2 percent. Nationally for plans on healthcare.gov the average increase among states was 7.5 percent. The highest price increase was in Oklahoma at 35.7 percent. The biggest price decrease was in Indiana at -12.6 percent.\n\nBut there are a few hurdles in comparing Michigan's increase to that in other states.\n\n\"There's just so many factors. One is that in some of these states there's just a lot less plan competition,\" Fangmeier said.\n\nHe said that Michigan has a relatively large number of insurers and plans on the marketplace, making the state's market more competitive.\n\nThere's also the fact that Michigan's insurers are still fine-tuning the rate setting on these plans. This will be the third year the exchange is open.\n\n\"Insurers have had varying experiences when it comes to setting the premiums for this population,\" Fangmeier said.\n\nThe cost for plans changes by county, and that data is not yet available. However, the department did estimate the benchmark plan's cost change in major metropolitan areas, and in the Detroit area it's expected to decline by 1 percent.\n\nIn an analysis of last year's numbers CHRT found a large variability between what coverage cost in different counties, especially on the west side of the state.\n\nOpen Enrollment in the Health Insurance Marketplace starts on Nov. 1, 2015 and runs through Jan. 31, 2016.\n\nEmily Lawler is a Capitol/Business reporter for MLive.
