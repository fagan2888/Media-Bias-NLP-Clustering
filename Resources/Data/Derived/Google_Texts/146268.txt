Dallas Regional Medical Center in Mesquite is among the 100 most expensive hospitals in the United States, according to a new report by National Nurses United, the largest nurses union in the country.

NNU based its findings on Medicare cost reports from this past June, which covered hospital charges and costs for fiscal year 2012. It found that the Mesquite hospital had a 772 percent charge-to-cost ratio, good enough for 95th on the list. The average charge-to-cost ratio among U.S. hospitals is 331 percent, according to the data.

The most expensive hospital in the U.S. is Meadowlands Hospital Medical Center, a 230-bed for-profit hospital in Secaucus, N.J. Its charge-to-cost ratio was 1,192 percent, meaning it essentially charged $1,200 for every $100 of total costs. The most expensive hospital in Texas, according to the data, was South Texas Health System in Edinburg, at 876 percent.

Dallas-based Tenet Healthcare had seven hospitals on the list.
