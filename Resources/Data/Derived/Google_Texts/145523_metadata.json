April 2, 2014 ( LifeSiteNews.com ) \u2013 During their first-ever meeting last week, Pope Francis gave President Barack Obama a blessed rosary. Yesterday, Obama gave that rosary to Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi.\n\nPelosi is perhaps the first person ever to receive a papal sacramental and Planned Parenthood's highest award in one week.\n\nObama gave the prayer beads to the House Minority Leader, an outspoken opponent of the Catholic Church's teachings on abortion and homosexuality, after they lunched together on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI was happy to receive a rosary blessed by Pope Francis. It means a great deal to me,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\nAdam Cassandra, communications manager at Human Life International, told LifeSiteNews that \u201cpeople could see it as somewhat disrespectful on the part of the president that he re-gifted the rosary given to him by the Holy Father,\u201d especially to someone \u201cwho has been harshly criticized by the Vatican for championing the mortal sin of abortion in opposition to Catholic teaching.\u201d\n\nObama gave Pelosi the rosary just days after Pelosi accepted Planned Parenthood's Margaret Sanger Award on March 27.\n\n\u201cNo one is more deserving of this honor than Leader Pelosi, who has fought tirelessly throughout her career to protect and expand women\u2019s access to health care,\u201d Planned Parenthood Federation of America President Cecile Richards said when she announced the award in January.\n\nShe also cited Pelosi's fervent support of the Affordable Care Act, part of which the Catholic bishops say tramples on religious freedom.\n\nThe former House Speaker used last Thursday's ceremony to criticism \u201cpersonhood\u201d laws and castigate pro-life figures, presumably including most Catholics, as ignorant.\n\n\u201cWhen you see how closed their minds are or oblivious or whatever it is \u2013 dumb \u2013 then you know what the fight is about,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the past, Pelosi, whose district includes San Francisco, has said that abortion is \u201csacred ground.\u201d Calling herself \u201can ardent, practicing Catholic,\u201d she stated erroroneously that the Catholic Church had no position on the morality of abortion until \u201clike maybe 50 years\u201d ago.\n\nSome Catholics oppose abortion, she said, because they have \u201cthis conscience thing.\u201d\n\nShe referred to bishops who oppose the HHS mandate as \u201clobbyists,\u201d saying, \u201cI am going to stick with my fellow Catholics in supporting the administration on this.\u201d\n\nLast June, she told Politico her first reaction to the Supreme Court decision striking down part of the Defense of Marriage Act was, \u201cThank God.\u201d\n\nActions such as these have led some priests to ask the congresswoman to \u201chave the honesty\u201d to \u201cformally renounce\u201d her Catholic faith.\n\nFailing that, some of the Catholic hierarchy's top leaders believe she should be denied Communion.\n\nClick \"like\" to support Catholics Restoring the Culture!\n\nLast September, Cardinal Raymond Burke told the Minneapolis-based newspaper The Catholic Star, \u201cCertainly this is a case when Canon 915 must be applied.\u201d Canon 915 of the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s Code of Canon Law admonishes priests that those \u201cwho obstinately persist in manifest grave sin, are not to be admitted to Holy Communion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a person who obstinately, after repeated admonitions, persists in a grave sin \u2014 cooperating with the crime of procured abortion \u2014 and still professes to be a devout Catholic,\u201d the cardinal said. \u201cI fear for Congresswoman Pelosi if she does not come to understand how gravely in error she is.\u201d\n\nCassandra told LifeSiteNews perhaps prayer will cause the scales to fall from her eyes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that Rep. Pelosi in her public political life has not been true to the teachings of her faith, so you could say she really needs [Obama's] gift,\u201d Cassandra said. \u201cWe can only hope that she will pray this rosary fervently asking for the intercession of our Blessed Mother to give her the strength to embrace the pro-life and pro-marriage teachings of the Church in her political actions.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "description": "Pelosi is perhaps the first person ever to receive a papal sacramental and Planned Parenthood's highest award in one week.", "title": "Obama gives rosary blessed by Pope Francis to Nancy Pelosi", "locale": "en_US", "image": "", "url": "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/obama-gives-rosary-blessed-by-pope-francis-to-nancy-pelosi", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "Pelosi is perhaps the first person ever to receive a papal sacramental and Planned Parenthood's highest award in one week."}, "description": "Pelosi is perhaps the first person ever to receive a papal sacramental and Planned Parenthood's highest award in one week.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 132010293551131, "pages": 112623813202}}, "article_summary": "NewsAbortion, FaithWASHINGTON, D.C.
