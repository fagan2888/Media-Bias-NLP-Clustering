The executive order reads in part:\n\n\u201cA growing body of evidence demonstrates that behavioral science insights \u2013 research findings from fields such as behavioral economics and psychology about how people make decisions and act on them \u2013 can be used to design government policies to better serve the American people.\u201d\n\nInterpretation?\n\nAll federal agencies from the Social Security Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Internal Revenue Service to ObamaCare, Medicare and Food Stamps \u2013 have a green light to do whatever needs to be done to manipulate, trick, fool or defraud the American people as long as you\u2019re \u201cStrengthening Federal Capacity for Behavioral Insights.\u201d\n\nThe idea of this \u201clab rat\u201d program is modeled after one implemented in the Great Britain \u2013 a socialist economic basket case \u2013 in 2010. The British effort led to \u201cBehavioral Insights Teams\u201d which used \u201citerative experimentation\u201d to test \u201cinterventions that will further advance priorities of the British government.\u201d\n\nIn science, \u201citerative experimentation\u201d is a technique used to change behavior through repetition \u2013 to move \u201clab rats\u201d or, in this case, people closer to a desired result\u2026 destigmatizing Food Stamps\u2026 use \u201cfairness\u201d to justify unemployment benefits\u2026 turn ObamaCare into an entitlement\u2026 accept bureaucratic regulations as \u201claw\u201d \u2013 you name it.\n\nEven more sinister is the author of treating people like \u201clab rats\u201d \u2013 Harvard law school professor Cass Sunstein \u2013 who doubles as Obama\u2019s handpicked regulatory know it all. According to Sunstein, you can \u201cnudge\u201d citizens towards certain behaviors and choices the government likes and away from public policies that government doesn\u2019t like (less government, lower taxes, entitlement reform and conceivably voting).\n\nIn a 2013 memo, discovered by and reported on Fox News at the time, the White House admitted that the initiative involved behavioral experimentation. The memo reads, in part:\n\n\u201cThe federal government is currently creating a new team that will help build federal capacity to experiment with these approaches, and to scale behavioral interventions that have been rigorously evaluated, using, where possible, randomized controlled trials.\u201d\n\nThe memo cited a practical application of behavioral manipulation in Great Britain. The English learned that sending out a letter to late taxpayers that read \u201c9 out of 10 people in Britain pay their taxes on time\u201d led to a 15 percent increase in compliance.\n\nThe new executive order encourages federal agencies to:\n\n\u201c\u2026identify policies, programs, and operations where applying behavioral science insights may yield substantial improvements in public welfare, program outcomes, and program cost effectiveness,\u201d as well as to \u201cdevelop strategies for applying behavioral science insights to programs and, where possible, rigorously test and evaluate the impact of these insights.\u201d\n\nTo jump-start the program across government agencies, administrators are encouraged to recruit behavioral science experts to join the federal government to \u201cbetter use empirical findings from the behavioral sciences\u201d to manipulate the choices people make and the opinions people have when dealing with government.\n\nThe president\u2019s \u201clab rat\u201d order specifically directs \u201cagencies to:\n\n\u2022 Identify opportunities to help qualifying individuals, families, communities, and businesses access public programs and benefits by, as appropriate, streamlining processes that may otherwise limit or delay participation \u2013 for example, removing administrative hurdles, shortening wait times, and simplifying forms;\n\n\u2022 Improve how information is presented to consumers, borrowers, program beneficiaries, and other individuals, whether as directly conveyed by the agency, or in setting standards for the presentation of information, by considering how the content, format, timing, and medium by which information is conveyed affects comprehension and action by individuals, as appropriate;\n\n\u2022 Identify programs that offer choices and carefully consider how the presentation and structure of those choices, including the order, number, and arrangement of options, can most effectively promote public welfare, as appropriate, giving particular consideration to the selection and setting of default options; and\n\n\u2022 Review elements of their policies and programs that are designed to encourage or make it easier for Americans to take specific actions, such as saving for retirement or completing education programs. In doing so, agencies shall consider how the timing, frequency, presentation, and labeling of benefits, taxes, subsidies, and other incentives can more effectively and efficiently promote those actions, as appropriate.\u201d\n\nOne program, Obamacare, is replete with \u201cnudge\u201d language and experimentation. In a fact sheet that accompanied the Executive Order, the White House noted that reminding individuals who had started to sign up for Obamacare led to a 13 percent increase in completed applications.\n\nTo help determine which presentation was more effective, the Department of Health and Human Services:\n\n\u201c\u2026sent one of eight behaviorally designed letter variants to each of more than 700,000 individuals who had already begun the health insurance enrollment process but had not yet completed an application.\u201d\n\nThe most effective version of the letter generated the 13 percent improvement. Other less effective letters only increased enrollment rates by around four percent. How these experiments improve the lives, expand the freedom and promote the happiness of the American \u201clab rats\u201d was not addressed by President Obama\u2019s Executive Order.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama signed a new Executive Order this week that authorizes federal agencies to conduct . . .", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Bob Conover", "og": {"site_name": "Liberty News Now", "description": "President Barack Obama signed a new Executive Order this week that authorizes federal agencies to conduct . . .", "title": "Is It Time To Put Your Tin Foil Hat On?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.libertynewsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/tin-foil-hat.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-18T11:25:30+00:00", "url": "http://www.libertynewsnow.com/is-it-time-to-put-your-tin-foil-hat-on/article2187", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp", "ca_image": "http://www.libertynewsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/tin-foil-hat-150x150.jpg", "article": {"section": "Featured", "tag": "Tin Foil Hat", "published_time": "2015-09-18T11:00:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-18T11:25:30+00:00"}, "ca_title": "Is It Time To Put Your Tin Foil Hat On?", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc416\"", "article_summary": "How these experiments improve the lives, expand the freedom and promote the happiness of the American \u201clab rats\u201d was not addressed by President Obama\u2019s Executive Order.\nPresident Barack Obama signed a new Executive Order this week that authorizes federal agencies to conduct behavioral experiments on U.S. citizens to better manipulate them and advance government goals.\nIn a fact sheet that accompanied the Executive Order, the White House noted that reminding individuals who had started to sign up for Obamacare led to a 13 percent increase in completed applications.\nIn a 2013 memo, discovered by and reported on Fox News at the time, the White House admitted that the initiative involved behavioral experimentation.\nEven more sinister is the author of treating people like \u201clab rats\u201d \u2013 Harvard law school professor Cass Sunstein \u2013 who doubles as Obama\u2019s handpicked regulatory know it all."}
