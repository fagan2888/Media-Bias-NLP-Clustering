Riverside is also considering the option.\n\nThe move is not only expected to save money, but will ensure districts have the subs needed to fill classroom absences and meet provisions of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cAcross the nation, this has been an emerging trend,\u201d said Michael Mahon, Ph.D., Abington Heights superintendent.\n\nThe districts have entered into contracts with Kelly Services, which offers substitute teaching services across the country.\n\nInstead of being employees of the school district, the subs work for Kelly. The districts will pay Kelly their daily sub rate, plus a service fee of between 30 and 40 percent. Kelly then pays the subs.\n\nThe change means districts no longer have to worry about tracking the number of hours a substitute works in a week. Under the Affordable Care Act, employees who work more than 30 hours a week must be offered health insurance. If substitute teachers work more than four days a week, they will work more than 30 hours. Tracking hours will now be the responsibility of Kelly. Last year, as districts prepared to meet the act\u2019s provisions, substitutes were limited to how much they could work in a week, even though districts experienced shortages.\n\nAt Lakeland, the process of filling positions will be much easier now, too. A staff member used to call subs to try to find someone to work.\n\n\u201cIt was a management nightmare,\u201d Superintendent R. Scott Jeffery said.\n\nKelly uses an automated system, and superintendents said they expect fill rates to be close to 100 percent.\n\nWhen a district cannot find a sub, teachers are pulled from their planning periods to cover the vacancy. Teachers are then reimbursed for missing their planning periods. In North Pocono, teacher coverage is $30 an hour. Subs make $80 per day.\n\nDistricts will also save in pension costs. This fiscal year, districts will contribute 25.8 percent of total payroll, including sub costs, to the Public School Employees Retirement System. Because the subs will be Kelly employees, districts will no longer have to contribute to pensions.\n\nNorth Pocono expects to save $40,000 this year, even with paying a service charge to Kelly, Superintendent Bryan McGraw said.\n\nContact the writer: shofius@timesshamrock.com, @hofiushallTT on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"title": "School districts outsourcing substitute placements", "author": "By Sarah Hofius Hall", "robots": "ACAP allow-index", "DC.creator": "By Sarah Hofius Hall", "tout": {"article": {"id": "1.1938905"}}, "keywords": "Local", "DC.subject": "Local", "bitly-verification": "68008dbe9586", "DC.title": "School districts outsourcing substitute placements"}, "article_summary": "Outsourcing substitute teaching jobs could save area school districts thousands of dollars this year.\nBecause the subs will be Kelly employees, districts will no longer have to contribute to pensions.\nIf substitute teachers work more than four days a week, they will work more than 30 hours.\nLocal districts, including Abington Heights, Lakeland, North Pocono and Valley View, will not employ their own substitute teachers and instead will rely on a staffing agency to fill vacancies.\nThe change means districts no longer have to worry about tracking the number of hours a substitute works in a week."}
