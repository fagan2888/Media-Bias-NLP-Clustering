Earlier in January, Coach Inc. (NYSE: COH) announced a deal to buy luxury shoe brand Stuart Weitzman for $574 million. In March, high-end footwear group Brian Atwood was sold to Steven Madden Ltd. (Nasdaq: SHOO).\n\nBruno Magli, headquartered in Bologna, Italy, has made footwear for a global consumer base, including celebrities, such as Solange Knowles and Lupita Nyong'o, and royals, since 1936. The company also makes handbags and accessories. The brand's corporate office will be moved to New York after the deal closes, but the company's core footwear and leather products will continue to be designed and manufactured in Italy.\n\nThe business, which is being sold by asset manager Da Vinci Invest filed for insolvency in July after years of debts piled up to almost \u008020 million.\n\nNew York-based Marquee focuses on growing brands through expanding products and geographies. The firm says it has started securing partnerships with more retailers for Bruno Magli. Marquee is sponsored by Neuberger Berman Private Equity, a unit of Neuberger Berman, an employee-controlled investment manager.\n\nCleary Cottlieb's Milan office and Studio Gnudi, advised Marquee on the deal.\n\nAside from interest in luxury footwear, the mid-market footwear space has also been attracting buyers. In August, Steve Madden acquired Dolce Vita Holdings for about $60 million. In August, Bain Capital LLC agreed to buy a 50 percent stake in casual footwear maker Toms Shoes Inc. Before, that, in June, Palladin Consumer Retail Partners LLC bought footwear retailer Aerosoles.\n\nThe Bruno Magli brand was brought to the American consciousness when a pair of the company's mens shoes were featured as evidence in the OJ Simpson murder trial in the late '90s.\n\nFor more information on related topics, visit the following:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.themiddlemarket.com/news/consumer_goods_retail/marquee-buys-luxury-footwear-brand-bruno-magli-254255-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.themiddlemarket.com/media/newspics/bruno-magli.jpg", "site_name": "Mergers & Acquisitions, Latest News", "title": "Marquee Buys Luxury Footwear Brand Bruno Magli"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda6d0\"", "article_summary": "Marquee Buys Luxury Footwear Brand Bruno MagliThe move follows luxury shoe acquisitions of Stuart Weitzman and Brian Atwood brandsMarquee Brands is buying Bruno Magli, a luxury brand known for its footwear.\nEarlier in January, Coach Inc.
