But the Drive-Bys cherry-picked his comments, and it didn\u2019t matter that there\u2019s no taking him out of context. They didn\u2019t have to. What he said was not wrong. It made infinite sense. \u2026 But the Drive-Bys think that they can use Jeb\u2019s remarks to give Hillary the moral high ground here on women\u2019s health, and women\u2019s rights, and the War on Women, and all of that.\u201d\n\nRush, then read from Bush\u2019s statement that, \u201cI\u2019m not sure we need half a billion dollars in funding for women\u2019s health programs,\u201d and \u201cIf you took dollar for dollar, there are many extraordinarily fine organizations, community health organizations that exist, federally sponsored community health organizations to provide quality care for women on a wide variety of health issues. \u201cBut abortion should not be funded by the government, any government in my mind.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cOnce the Drive-By Media got wind of what was happening on Twitter, they joined the party. And it was time to destroy Jeb, time to destroy Jeb for insensitivity, racism, sexism, bigotry, insensitivity to the plight of women. Even though Jeb said, I don\u2019t know if we need to be spending all this money, and then he went on to praise all of the federal organizations that he just knows are there that are, that are providing just wonderful healthcare for all of these women who are so denied it in this mean-spirited country. Why, you would think that women cannot get healthcare in America, even after Obamacare, even after the Affordable Care Act! But yet here\u2019s Jeb Bush, citing all of the federal programs and praising them, and it wasn\u2019t enough, was it? Here\u2019s crossing the aisle, folks. Here\u2019s trying to compromise. Here\u2019s working with the other side. Here is showing we can govern. Here is showing that we can cooperate. Here is showing that we\u2019re not hate-mongers like some in our conservative media are, and what happened? It all blew up right back in his face, because of one phrase: \u2018Although, I\u2019m not sure we need a half a billion dollars for women\u2019s health issues.\u2019 That little aside was blown up on social media as precisely an example of the Republican Party attacking women\u2019s health issues.\u201d\n\nRush concluded, \u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything wrong, and he gets attacked as conducting a War on Women. And then tries to correct it, and that didn\u2019t work. When are these people gonna learn you can\u2019t compromise, you can\u2019t cross the aisle, you can\u2019t extend the flying fickle finger of friendship, or hand of friendship, whatever, you can\u2019t. There is no bipartisanship. There is no cooperation. There is no showing on the other side we can govern. They\u2019re not interested in that. When, if ever, is the establishment on our side going to figure out the reality?\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rush Limbaugh stated that the controversy over Jeb Bush's remarks on women's healthcare is evidence that \"you can't compromise\" with the left", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Rush Limbaugh stated that the controversy over Jeb Bush's remarks on women's healthcare is evidence that \"you can't compromise\" with the left", "title": "Rush: Jeb Women's Health Controversy Shows 'You Can't Compromise' With the Left - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Rush-211-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/08/05/rush-jeb-womens-health-controversy-shows-you-cant-compromise-with-the-left/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rush Limbaugh stated that the controversy over Jeb Bush's remarks on women's healthcare is evidence that \"you can't compromise\" with the left", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Rush-211-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Rush: Jeb Women's Health Controversy Shows 'You Can't Compromise' With the Left - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Jeb Bush, Rush Limbaugh,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV,Rush", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Rush Limbaugh", "published_time": "2015-08-05T11:51:14-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf59f\"", "article_summary": "But yet here\u2019s Jeb Bush, citing all of the federal programs and praising them, and it wasn\u2019t enough, was it?\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERTalk radio host Rush Limbaugh stated that the controversy over Jeb Bush\u2019s remarks on women\u2019s healthcare is evidence that \u201cyou can\u2019t compromise\u201d with the left on Wednesday.\nWhen are these people gonna learn you can\u2019t compromise, you can\u2019t cross the aisle, you can\u2019t extend the flying fickle finger of friendship, or hand of friendship, whatever, you can\u2019t.\nAnd it was time to destroy Jeb, time to destroy Jeb for insensitivity, racism, sexism, bigotry, insensitivity to the plight of women.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERRush said, \u201cJeb said absolutely nothing wrong in his original comments, absolutely nothing wrong."}
