However, it would lose its grandfathered status, meaning the city would be required to provide preventative care coverage, and the end result of the changes would be a net loss.\n\nThat preventative care coverage would include contraception for women without employee cost-sharing; all deductibles and all co-pays for medical and prescription care to count toward out-of-pocket maximum expenses; expanding claims and appeal requirements; covering out-of-network emergency rooms the same as in-network emergency rooms; and covering routine costs associated with clinical trials.\n\nLaRea Albert, vice president of self-funded plans for Employee Plan Services, said those preventative care changes would cost the city an additional $305,502 in estimated claims.\n\nShe said many health plan operators face similar difficult decisions because of rising health costs.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the national long-term average annual increase in medical costs is 5.42 percent.\n\nThe city has seen its medical costs increase on average 11.25 percent since 2011, with prescription drug costs more than doubling in that time, Albert said.\n\nComplicating the matter is that employee claims have exceeded the city's budget forecast annually the past four years, said Director of Administrative Services Mary Ann Miller. It's resulted in the health plan fund balance dwindling by more than $1 million.\n\nAt this past week's City Council meeting, Willard said the city could see its general fund revenues decrease as much as $6 million. Budget Director Angela Coen said she based that estimate on a $6.9 million spending plan for health insurance.\n\nWillard said he intends to present a draft 2017 budget to the council in mid-to-late July.\n\nWhile health plan trustees and administrators decide how to reconcile the deficit estimates, Albert said Employee Plan Services will search for savings to the city's prescription drug plan.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"url": "http://www.news-journal.com/news/2016/may/04/city-of-longview-might-be-forced-to-charge-employe/", "image": "https://static.texascommunitymedia.com/static/lnj/images/logos/default_share_logo.png", "type": "article", "description": "The city of Longview might begin charging employees \u2014 and possibly retirees \u2014 premiums to help offset health insurance costs in the upcoming fiscal year ...", "title": "City of Longview might be forced to charge employees health premiums - Longview News-Journal"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "blitz": "mu-10ba9b19-0c38fcd6-4c764ea6-9fa4649b", "fb": {"app_id": 1419380718274846}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://static.texascommunitymedia.com/static/lnj/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "article_summary": "She said many health plan operators face similar difficult decisions because of rising health costs.\nThe city operates a self-funded health plan for employees, retirees, their spouses and dependents.\nWhile health plan trustees and administrators decide how to reconcile the deficit estimates, Albert said Employee Plan Services will search for savings to the city's prescription drug plan.\nIt will cost the city $7,286,470 to maintain the plan without charging employee premiums, according to consultants with Employer Plan Services of Houston.\nRaising premiums for employees and retirees would cut city costs at least $417,000."}
