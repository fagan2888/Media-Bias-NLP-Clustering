On Sunday evening, HBO’s John Oliver briefly poked fun at President Obama‘s “long overdue” first visit to Indian country.

Noting that, as NBC News reported, Obama’s visit to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe makes him the fourth sitting president to ever visit a reservation, Oliver joked that “technically, if you count non-sitting presidents, then Andrew Jackson did visit a lot.” (Before his presidency, Jackson led U.S. forces in defeating the Creek Indians in 1912 and, later, various tribes during the First Seminole War.)

Upon Obama’s visit, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced a $70 million allotment of funds to improve tribal housing conditions, including projects of mold removal. “To which the Native Americans presumably said, ‘Ah, finally, we are officially square!'” Oliver joked. “‘It was touch-and-go for a few centuries there, but at the end of the day, all we wanted was our mold removed.'”
