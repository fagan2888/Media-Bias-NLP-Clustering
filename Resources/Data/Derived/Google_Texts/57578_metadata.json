Many bridges in the county have also been breached, Enfante said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a waiting game right now. We can\u2019t determine the extent of damage until the river starts receding and it\u2019s still moving pretty good,\u201d Enfante said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to wait.\u201d\n\nThe National Weather Service was predicting water flows near Weldona to peak Sunday afternoon at near-record flows of 44,671 cubic feet per-second. Tuesday morning, the river was running at about 350 cfs.\n\nNear Hillrose, BNSF Railway workers were dumping loads of gravel attempting reinforce the railroad bed as the South Platte widened to within 6-feet of the track. The line is used to move coal from Wyoming to a power plant near Brush.\n\nIn the town of Sterling, 45-miles east, officials are reporting that the South Platte continues to rise and is flowing over several bridges, forcing some road closures.\n\nBetween 100-150 people were evacuated in low-lying areas along the South Platte between Atwood and Sterling, said Logan County Emergency Operations spokeswoman Sheryl Lopez.\n\nShe added that the river is expected to peak around 8 p.m. Sunday.\n\nAccording to a media release, the city has opened a shelter at Sterling Middle School and large animals can be kept at the Logan County Fairgrounds.\n\nHousing 2,585 inmates \u2014 including all of Colorado\u2019s death-row inmates \u2014 the Sterling Correctional Facility has incurred no damage and no evacuation plans will be needed, said Colorado Department of Corrections spokesman Roger Hudson.\n\n\u201cOur facilities are running at normal besides the Denver complex, which has minor water damage in the visitation areas,\u201d Hudson said.\n\nHe added that visitation times at the Sterling facility have been cut short to ensure visitors can make it home safely Sunday evening.\n\nIn the far northwest section of Washington County, Prewitt Reservoir is quickly filling after low-water levels forced the closure of the boat ramp this July.\n\nWashington County Emergency Management spokesman Chris Packer said his department received a report Sunday morning from a sheriff\u2019s deputy that the rising waters had not yet breached the reservoir.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something we believe will probably happen, but we really don\u2019t have a plan in place if it does,\u201d Packer said.\n\nPacker said reverse 911 calls were sent out Friday residents in the small sliver of Washington County the South Platte runs through. Approximately 50 homes in the area faced mandatory evacuations. Packer said a few people refused to leave.\n\nOne road in the area has been washed out, and three bridges flooded.\n\n\u201cFor us, we\u2019re probably going to lose those bridges, which then cuts off that little portion of the county to rest of the county,\u201d Packer said. \u201cTheir ability to go for resources will be good to the north, however.\u201d\n\nSitting just a few miles south of the Nebraska border, Julesburg in Sedgwick County will be the final town in Colorado the floodwaters pass through.\n\nThis weekend, water flows were in the double digits. Water flows are expected to crest Wednesday at a record 12,000 cfs.\n\nSedgwick County Emergency Management Office director Mark Turner said the South Platte runs about three-quarters of a mile outside of town with a flat floodplain separating it from the town.\n\n\u201cRight now we\u2019ve got everybody moving cattle and livestock out of the river bottom\u201d Turner said. \u201cThere\u2019s a couple residences that are packing everything up.\u201d\n\nNo large evacuations are planned and the hope is the floodwaters won\u2019t hit many sections of town, he said. The last major flood to hit Julesburg happened in 1965.\n\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t know what might happen because we\u2019ve never seen this much water come at us before,\u201d Turner said.\n\nAustin Briggs: abriggs@denverpost.com, twitter.com/abriggs10 or 303-954-1729", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Eastern Colorado counties brace for rush of floodwaters", "title": "Eastern Colorado counties brace for rush of floodwaters", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/15/eastern-colorado-counties-brace-for-rush-of-floodwaters/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130915__eastplainsfloodp1.jpg", "height": 412}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130915__eastplainsfloodp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-15T18:09:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T08:35:35+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd83bd\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to wait.\u201dThe National Weather Service was predicting water flows near Weldona to peak Sunday afternoon at near-record flows of 44,671 cubic feet per-second.\n\u201cFor us, we\u2019re probably going to lose those bridges, which then cuts off that little portion of the county to rest of the county,\u201d Packer said.\nNear Hillrose, BNSF Railway workers were dumping loads of gravel attempting reinforce the railroad bed as the South Platte widened to within 6-feet of the track.\nWater flows are expected to crest Wednesday at a record 12,000 cfs.\nBetween 100-150 people were evacuated in low-lying areas along the South Platte between Atwood and Sterling, said Logan County Emergency Operations spokeswoman Sheryl Lopez."}
