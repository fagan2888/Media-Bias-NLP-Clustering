London’s Borough Market will soon be home to a unique way of tying one on. Thanks to a new installation dubbed “Alcoholic Architecture,” pub-goers will now be able to consume their alcohol via a “walk-in cloud of breathable cocktail.” This unique way of consuming alcohol without actually drinking it is the brainchild of Bompas & Parr, a food art studio heralded for its “immersive flavour-based experiences.”

At first glance, this “alcoholic weather system” may bear a striking resemblance to the dangerous alcohol vaporization fad that caught on with quite a few people in the United States. However, respiratory scientists tasked with studying the effects of this breathable alcohol technique have arrived at an optimal dwell time to ensure safety. So how is walking through a cloud of alcohol vapor different from smoking alcohol?

Doctors in the U.S. were quick to raise safety concerns regarding the inhalation of vaporized alcohol after calorie-conscious drinkers thought they found a healthier way for getting buzzed. They found that the vaporized alcohol caused dryness in the mouth and nasal passage, which subsequently left people more vulnerable to infection. Inhaling alcohol instead of drinking it also increases a person’s risk for alcohol poisoning.

Alcoholic Architecture, on the other hand, uses powerful humidifiers that saturate the air with one part fine spirits and three parts mixer. Whereas vaporized alcohol enters the brain directly via the lungs, Bompas & Parr’s method allows the alcohol to enter the bloodstream through the lungs and eyeballs. Respiratory scientists found that 50 minutes of exposure was the equivalent of one liquid drink. Guests are asked to wear protective ponchos to ensure against overexposure.

This highly anticipated installation will open to people 18 and up on July 31 and will run until early 2016. Tickets will go for £12.50, (around $20 USD).
