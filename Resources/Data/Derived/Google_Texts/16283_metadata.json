To submit a question for consideration, send an e-mail to Benjamin.\n\n@BillyStup \u2014 Are the Broncos better off in the secondary without Champ Bailey playing?\n\nBH: It\u2019s crazy to think that we\u2019ve gotten to the point where this question would ever be asked. But the cornerback again won\u2019t play (foot) at the Giants on Sunday. And for the fans, the most recent image of Bailey is his futile chase of Torrey Smith after Smith burned him in the playoff game.\n\nI will say this: When Champ is ready to play, you must start him and see what he has in the tank. He\u2019s too talented and too hungry to just push him aside, even if Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, Chris Harris, Tony Carter and the gang fared pretty well against Baltimore in Week 1. Yes, I know Champ\u2019s so old that he voted for Coolidge. But consider that even last season, he led the NFL in yards per cover snaps, according to profootballfocus.com (0.82). And when in coverage of a play, of the players in the top 10 on that list, his opposing QBs had the lowest combined passer rating.\n\nThe glass-half-full view is that other Broncos cornerbacks fared well in the opener. According to PFF, Rodgers-Cromartie had the most coverage snaps (49) of the corners to allow a 0.00. And Harris had a good game, including the INT, as evidenced by his plus-3.3 overall grade on PFF, good for second among all CBs.\n\nHere are some other fun Broncos tidbits, courtesy of profootballfocus.com:\n\n\u2022 Demaryius Thomas leads all wide receivers with 24.8 yards after catch per reception.\n\n\u2022 Peyton Manning has the highest NFL passer rating (148.7) when he has 2.5 seconds and less of time in the pocket.\n\n\u2022 Of Shaun Phillips\u2019 45 passing snaps as a 4-3 DE, 64.4 percent came from the left side. He tallied three sacks and two hurries from this side.\n\n@shaunehiggins \u2014 where should the NFL draw the line on caring re: what happens off the field? VM\u2019s issues beg q\u2019s re: sense, but y should NFL care?\n\nBH: Definitely a fascinating topic with Von Miller, one I attacked in one of my daily Happy Hour columns. Basically, the NFL has to protect its brand; it can\u2019t let its league turn more into the Wild West than it already is. Many fans want the players to be held accountable. But really, there are also many fans who don\u2019t really care what a dude does, as long as he does a lot of awesome stuff on Sundays. These fans compartmentalize. There are two categories, in reference to things a player does off the field: \u201cbad\u201d and \u201cactual bad.\u201d I think these fans chalk up driving without a license (err, speeding without a license) as simply \u201cbad.\u201d They\u2019re not thaaat ticked off. Only when it comes to \u201cactual bad\u201d stuff, such as major crimes, does it truly rattle these fans.\n\n@krause_tobias \u2014 What is your favorite triangle?\n\nBH: Isosceles, obviously.\n\n@TOsieczanek \u2014 who is @PeytonsHead on Twitter?\n\nBH: Uncovering this would earn a Pulitzer. This guy/gal (Best head on Twitter. Making fun of sports, pop culture, and my size! Control center for the #LaserRocketArm) has 81,000 followers, and is good for a follow, if only to hear him/her opine about Broncos stuff. How funny would it be if it was actually Peyton running the account (like Michael Keaton in \u201cNowhere to Run,\u201d when he plays an FBI undercover agent who wears shirt that says FBI).\n\nHere\u2019s a good Peyton\u2019s Head tweet: Deion Sanders\u2019 wife is suing for $200M, claiming she\u2019s been portrayed as a gold digger. Deion\u2019s defense? \u201cYour Honor, she\u2019s suing for $200M\u201d\n\n@AndrewLiv \u2014 why do writers find the need to announce that they aren\u2019t using the Redskins team name? Trying to draw attention 2 themselves?\n\nBH: No, they\u2019re trying to draw attention to the issue. I\u2019ve actually got a lot of backlash on Twitter from fans who think the Redskins should keep their name. I said to the fans, what if a new team was named after something that was brutally offensive to you and your culture? And surprisingly, a lot of people said they wouldn\u2019t care or take it personally.\n\nObviously, the NFL is a business, and having a huge brand in the Redskins is going to make them money. But it\u2019s so offensive, right? Like, if there was going to be an expansion team (a point brought up by writer Christine Brennan), and someone suggested \u201cRedskins,\u201d there\u2019s NO WAY the league would sign off on that.\n\nAll I say is, even if you\u2019re a staunch supporter of Redskins the name, force yourself to read this piece by the brilliant Dave Zirin.\n\n@zombyboy \u2014 What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?\n\nBH: An African or European swallow?\n\nBenjamin Hochman: bhochman@denverpost.com or twitter.com/hochman\n\n\n\nTo submit a question for Hochman\u2019s Mailbag, send an e-mail to Benjamin.\n\n\n\nVisit denverpost.com each weekday near quittin\u2019 time for a heavy pour of sports commentary from Denver Post columnist Benjamin Hochman.
