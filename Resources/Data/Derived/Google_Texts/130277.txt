The man accused of shooting another and then himself at an east Wichita business Thursday afternoon has died.

The shooting happened around 2:15 p.m. at the Flying Pig Gift Boutique, a resale shop in the 2600 block of east Douglas. That's two blocks east of Grove.

According to Wichita Police, a 40-year-old man walked into the store, which is owned by his 31-year-old ex-girlfriend. He was carrying a shotgun and asked everyone inside to leave, saying he was looking for two people.

His ex-girlfriend left the store through the backdoor at the same time her current 46-year-old boyfriend walked in.

The suspect confronted the other man, then shot him in the leg/groin area. The 46-year-old was able to get out of the store, then heard two more shots. He peeked in through a window and saw the suspect had shot himself in the head.

Police arrived, and both men were rushed to a local hospital.

The victim is now listed in good condition and is expected to be released on Saturday.

The suspect passed away at around 5 p.m. Friday, his sister said. She also said that despite police reports saying he was expected to recover, he had a slim chance of survival. No names were released.

Police believe the shooting was domestic-related. Officers say the suspect had sought out his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend.

The 46-year-old had earlier reported to police earlier this month that the suspect had threatened him over the phone.
