Kansas City Police Chief Darryl Forte said the boy died Saturday night.\n\nMirsad Hamidovic, 23, had previously been charged with two counts of child abuse and two counts of domestic assault.\n\nAccording to court records, police said Hamidovic had been watching the toddler while the boy's mother was at work. Police said Hamidovic told them he jumped on and off of a bed and landed on top of the boy. Police said Hamidovic also told them that he had shaken the boy, who started vomiting blood and became unresponsive.\n\nMedical personnel said the toddler had brain injuries and a lacerated liver that was consistent with being jumped on.\n\nProsecutors had previously requested Hamidovic's bond be set at $500,000. Additional charges against Hamidovic may be filed in the wake of the boy's death.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mirsad Hamidovic, 23, had previously been charged with two counts of child abuse and two counts of domestic assault.", "language": "english", "author": "KMBC", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Toddler-dies-of-injuries-suffered-in-child-abuse-incident-288197891.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Mirsad+Hamidovic.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Mirsad Hamidovic, 23, had previously been charged with two counts of child abuse and two counts of domestic assault.", "title": "Toddler dies of injuries suffered in child abuse incident"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Mirsad Hamidovic, 23, had previously been charged with two counts of child abuse and two counts of domestic assault.", "title": "Toddler dies of injuries suffered in child abuse incident", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Toddler-dies-of-injuries-suffered-in-child-abuse-incident-288197891.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Mirsad+Hamidovic.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Toddler dies of injuries suffered in child abuse incident", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Toddler dies of injuries suffered"}, "article_summary": "Mirsad Hamidovic, 23, had previously been charged with two counts of child abuse and two counts of domestic assault.\nA toddler who was severely injured in what prosecutors called a serious child abuse case has become Kansas City's first homicide victim of 2015.\nPolice said Hamidovic told them he jumped on and off of a bed and landed on top of the boy.\nMedical personnel said the toddler had brain injuries and a lacerated liver that was consistent with being jumped on.\nAccording to court records, police said Hamidovic had been watching the toddler while the boy's mother was at work."}
