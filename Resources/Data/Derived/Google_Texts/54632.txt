Broncos’ general manager John Elway has been elected into the New York Penn League’s Hall of Fame, along with pitcher Randy Johnson and statistician Charlie Wride.

Elway is better known as a former Stanford quarterback who became the No. 1 overall pick of the Baltimore Colts in the 1983 NFL Draft and was soon traded to the Denver Broncos, where he went on to have a Pro Football Hall of Fame career.

But before earning money through football, Elway was selected in the second round of the 1981 Major League Baseball draft as a left-handed hitting outfielder for the New York Yankees. In 1982, the summer between his junior and senior seasons at Stanford, Elway played for the Oneonta Yankees of the Class A New York Penn League. He hit .318 with four homers, 25 RBI and 13 stolen bases in 45 games.

The 6-foot-10, left-handed Johnson played college ball at USC where his catcher was Jack Del Rio, who is now the Broncos’ defensive coordinator. Johnson wound up with 303 major-league wins and 4,875 strikeouts. He started his pro career with the Jamestown Expos in the New York Penn League.

Wride is a long-time researcher and statistician for the NY Penn League.
