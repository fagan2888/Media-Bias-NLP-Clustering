Although Old Person was allowed to participate through the actions of some of the incoming Councilmen, there was no chair for him at the table. Incoming Councilman Joe McKay brought him a chair from the audience, but Old Person was not allowed to vote on the Executive Council members.\n\nInstead, George Calftail, who was appointed to Old Person\u2019s seat the day before inauguration by the Willie Sharp faction, voted in his place and spoke as a sitting Councilman.\n\nPrayers were heard in abundance, with Titus Upham and singers providing music for people entering the Arbor, then Father Ed Kohler and elder Al Potts offering prayers of their own.\n\nThe ceremony began with departing Councilmen speaking, mostly talking about how they\u2019d tried to accomplish things for the Tribe. Then it was the sitting Councilpersons\u2019 turn. Bill Old Chief spoke about the difficulty he\u2019d had in getting things done and focused on opportunities available to the Blackfeet Tribe. While he strongly believes in what he is doing, Old Chief said he would \u201chumble\u201d himself and work with the newly elected members.\n\nOld Chief was followed by Cheryl Little Dog, who departed from the theme of unity expressed by nearly everyone else. She complained about the Indian Health Service, the Affordable Care Act and the actions of some Councilpersons over the past several months. While Little Dog had some vocal support from the audience, that changed when she began attacking Earl Old Person. Saying, \u201cHe\u2019s not my chief\u201d and blaming him for paychecks not being issued on time during Christmas and Easter, Little Dog\u2019s supporters grew less and less vocal while others began shouting for her to be shut off. Police filed into the Arbor, but Little Dog walked back her remarks somewhat, saying, \u201cEveryone has their opinion\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m praying for you all.\u201d\n\nForrestina Calf Boss Ribs was next and said she wishes for people to put their discord behind them so the Blackfeet can be a great nation again, and George Calftail spoke, beginning with the comment, \u201cPraise the Lord and pass the ammunition.\u201d\n\nEarl Old Person then spoke in a calm voice, questioning the vitriol he\u2019d encountered over the past several months and wondering aloud how many times he\u2019s been suspended from the BTBC in the last six weeks. His remarks and statements calmed the crowd and paved the way for the rest of the inauguration.\n\nThe five new members were sworn in, but before voting on the new Executive Council was held, Tyson Running Wolf took part in a pipe ceremony. Following the ceremony, voting was held for Chairman, Vice Chairman and Secretary. Harry Barnes won the Chairmanship on a 5-4 vote, beating out Bill Old Chief. Iliff \u201cScott\u201d Kipp was named Vice Chairman, winning over Calf Boss Ribs, and Running Wolf assumed the Secretary position, beating Little Dog.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Barnes announced the Tribal Council would meet at 1:30 p.m. the same day. At that meeting, the BTBC voted to remove Calftail and to reinstate Old Person, all on 5-4 votes.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Golden Triangle News", "description": "While the inauguration of the five new 2014 Blackfeet Tribal Business Council members came off with the expected installment of the new Councilmen and the election of the Tribal Executive Council, the process reflected the disunity experienced by the Blackfeet Tribe over the past two years.", "title": "Barnes elected Chairman at BTBC inauguration", "url": "http://www.cutbankpioneerpress.com/glacier_reporter/news/article_258fcb08-0c53-11e4-a8bc-0019bb2963f4.html", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/cutbankpioneerpress.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/35/d357c268-0c53-11e4-8bac-0019bb2963f4/53c57d4614094.preview-620.jpg?resize=620%2C350", "height": 350}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 135817296433862}, "keywords": "news,featured", "news_keywords": "news,featured", "description": "While the inauguration of the five new 2014 Blackfeet Tribal Business Council members came off with the expected installment of the new Councilmen and the election of the Tribal Executive Council, the process reflected the disunity experienced by the Blackfeet Tribe over the past two years."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf34b\"", "article_summary": "At that meeting, the BTBC voted to remove Calftail and to reinstate Old Person, all on 5-4 votes.\nIn his opening remarks, Barnes announced the Tribal Council would meet at 1:30 p.m. the same day.\nWhile he strongly believes in what he is doing, Old Chief said he would \u201chumble\u201d himself and work with the newly elected members.\nHarry Barnes won the Chairmanship on a 5-4 vote, beating out Bill Old Chief.\nAlthough Old Person was allowed to participate through the actions of some of the incoming Councilmen, there was no chair for him at the table."}
