The first baby of the new year at the James and Connie Maynard Children's Hospital at Vidant Medical Center in Greenville arrived shortly after midnight.

Donovan Cherry was born at 12:05 Wednesday morning. He weighed 8 pounds 14 ounces.

New mom Tamechia Cherry of Windsor says the doctor turned on the TV as the ball was dropping at midnight and 5 minutes later baby Donovan was born.

Tamechia says, "Definitely unexpected. We weren't due until the 4th. Came in on Friday and they told us we were staying. Had no idea we would have the New Year's baby.

Tamechia is a first time mom.

So far she has a great little boy. He slept through her entire interview.
