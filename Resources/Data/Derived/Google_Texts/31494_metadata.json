Are you kidding?\u201d Rep. Jim Moran (D-Virginia) said when asked by CNSNews if he had perused the entire bill, which was just posted online late Tuesday night before it was ultimately passed in by the House by a vote of 300-119 about 36 hours later.\n\nMoran said he did not plan to read the entire bill before voting because \u201cI trust the leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think [House Speaker John] Boehner and [Senate Majority Leader Harry] Reid have read it?\u201d asked CNSNews.\n\n\u201cI know their staff has,\u201d Moran responded.\n\nWhen pressed directly about his knowledge of every aspect of the massive National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) of 2015, House Speaker Boehner (R-Ohio) assured CNSNews he was aware of all aspects of the multi-faceted, complex bill.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been through almost every part of that bill, as it was being put together,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, trust me, I am well aware of what\u2019s in that bill.\u201d\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Maryland) also indirectly acknowledged the near impossibility for anyone to read such a comprehensive bill. He told CNSNews he had not read the full text, but understands its contents.\n\n\u201cThe committees have gone over it, it\u2019s been in conference, and I have an outline of exactly what it does,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I know what it does.\u201d\n\nUpon taking control of the US House in 2010, Republicans maintained that they would allow the public to read full text of bills at least three days before they are voted on in the Lower Chamber. This promise materialized, in part, from a quote by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2010, when her Democratic Party controlled the House and help shepherd the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, through Congress.\n\n\u201cWe have to pass the bill so that you can find out what\u2019s in it, away from the fog of the controversy,\u201d Pelosi infamously stated of the hot-button legislation. While she may have been alluding to what she believed to be the bill\u2019s future popularity, following the rancor and oft-disputed claims - \u201cdeath panels\u201d - surrounding the debate over what the legislation meant for a sensitive issue like health care, the line was used as a political cudgel to help the GOP regain the House later that year.\n\nYet, Republicans voted on the 2015 NDAA after the full bill had been available to read - for both the public and members of Congress - just 36 hours prior, as pointed out by InfoWars.\n\nThe legislation will now get a vote in the Senate, likely next week.\n\nThe NDAA is annual legislation that directs budgeting and expenditures for the US military. The bill passed in the House on Thursday \u201cauthorizes $521 billion in base discretionary spending for Defense Department activities, as well as $64 billion for overseas contingency operations,\u201d according to The Hill.\n\nThe legislation authorized $6.6 billion for operations against Islamic State, the extremist group that is the target of US-led airstrikes in Syria and Iraq. That funding to combat Islamic State includes authorization of the deployment of 1,500 additional US forces and funding to train and supply Iraqi security forces over the next two years.\n\n\"I really wish to emphasize that the train-and-equip mission is just that. It in no way, shape, manner or form authorizes the use of military force,\" said Rep. Adam Smith (D-Washington), the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee.\n\nThe 2015 NDAA targeted US soldiers with cuts to benefits and other services.\n\n\u201cThe bill also reduces benefits for troops and their families. It would raise the copay by $3 for most pharmaceuticals under Tricare, the military health insurance plan,\u201d The Hill added.\n\nThe legislation also included cuts to subsidies for military commissaries, where US service members buy groceries, by $100 million.\n\nIn addition, such massive, must-pass bills are chocked full of \u201cpork,\u201d or just about anything a House member, especially those with clout, can pass by House leadership and the various committees that have domain over the bill\u2019s attributes.\n\nFor example, as RT reported Wednesday, the 2015 NDAA includes a handful of land deals including one that gives a foreign mining company 2,400 acres of national forest in Arizona that is cherished ancestral homeland to Apache natives.\n\n\u201cSince time immemorial people have gone there. That\u2019s part of our ancestral homeland,\" Terry Rambler, chairman of the San Carlos Apache Tribe, told The Huffington Post. \"We\u2019ve had dancers in that area forever - sunrise dancers - and coming-of-age ceremonies for our young girls that become women. They\u2019ll seal that off. They\u2019ll seal us off from the acorn grounds, and the medicinal plants in the area, and our prayer areas.\u201d\n\nPreviously, the House refused an amendment to the NDAA of 2014 that would have repealed a controversial provision placed in the NDAA of 2012 that has ever since provided the executive branch with the power to arrest and detain indefinitely any US citizen thought to be affiliated with Al-Qaeda or associated organizations. The House also rejected last year an amendment that would have expedited the shut-down of the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\nIn January of 2014, the US Supreme Court decided against weighing in on a challenge to Section 1021(b)(2) of the 2012 NDAA, which can be interpreted in a way that allows for the government to detain without trial any American citizen accused of committing a \u201cbelligerent act\u201d against the country \u201cuntil the end of hostilities.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "US House members admitted they had not read the entire $585 billion, 1,648-page National Defense Authorization Act, which predominantly specifies budgeting for the Defense Department, before it was voted on Thursday in Congress.", "og": {"site_name": "RT International", "description": "US House members admitted they had not read the entire $585 billion, 1,648-page National Defense Authorization Act, which predominantly specifies budgeting for the Defense Department, before it was voted on Thursday in Congress.", "title": "Congressmen admit to not reading NDAA before voting for it: 'I trust the leadership'", "locale": "en_EN", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/33/ba/70/00/us.si.jpg", "url": "https://www.rt.com/usa/211879-ndaa-congress-read-bills/", "type": "article"}, "navigation": "tabbed", "twitter": {"description": "US House members admitted they had not read the entire $585 billion, 1,648-page National Defense Authorization Act, which predominantly specifies budgeting for the Defense Department, before it was voted on Thursday in Congress.", "title": "RT International", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/33/ba/70/00/us.si.jpg", "creator": "@RT_com", "site": "@RT_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "format-detection": "telephone=yes", "msvalidate.01": "36879475773792950F4872586A371571", "google-site-verification": "VQLbsaWKiXW2-Vt4lP7MevnhMES537NO4fQjfGgLcbI", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "MobileOptimzied": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcba19\"", "article_summary": "The NDAA is annual legislation that directs budgeting and expenditures for the US military.\nWhen pressed directly about his knowledge of every aspect of the massive National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) of 2015, House Speaker Boehner (R-Ohio) assured CNSNews he was aware of all aspects of the multi-faceted, complex bill.\nThe House also rejected last year an amendment that would have expedited the shut-down of the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been through almost every part of that bill, as it was being put together,\u201d he said.\nThe legislation also included cuts to subsidies for military commissaries, where US service members buy groceries, by $100 million."}
