(Photo: Kelly Wilkinson/The Star )Buy Photo\n\nSince its founding in 1964, MJ Insurance has grown steadily. Perhaps even more impressive, it has never had a year in the red.\n\nIn each of its first 49 full years, company executives say the provider of commercial insurance, risk management, employee benefits and human resources consulting has posted a profit. Now as it approaches a half century in business in June, the company has posted its highest-ever revenues of $25 million for fiscal 2013, which ended in August and has watched sales rise another 12 percent for the first six months of fiscal 2014.\n\nWhat is MJ Insurance\u2019s secret? It has kept adding new clients while holding onto existing ones \u2014 just as it has been able to retain many of its veteran employees.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve watched them grow,\u201d said Robert Wagner, founding partner for Lewis Wagner LLP in Indianapolis and a client of MJ Insurance since 1972.\n\nWagner\u2019s own firm represents many in the insurance industry, and he said MJ employees demonstrate the type of intelligence and experience that allow them to manage risk competently, while not overloading clients with unnecessary insurance products. \u201cYou know the people there, and you have confidence in them,\u201d Wagner said.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to be a trusted adviser first,\u201d said Michael H. Bill, who assumed the role of chief executive officer for MJ in 2006, taking over for his father, Michael M. Bill.\n\nReflecting the thoughtful approach that company executives and clients say defines MJ, the family-owned insurance agency executed the leadership change through a carefully planned, 10-year transition. That gave everyone time to get used to changing roles, and for the successor, Michael H. Bill, to help create and advise a new leadership team.\n\nThe younger Bill said his father, who founded the company with James Ritter half a century ago and continues to serve as its chairman, has been as a mentor to him, allowing him to hone his skills as a leader, become a professional mentor in his own right, and set a course for the future. \u201cHe would always give us his perspective and advice, but once leadership was transitioned to myself and team, he\u2019s never questioned decisions and he\u2019s always been 100 percent supportive,\u201d the second-generation leader said.\n\nMJ looks to leverage its reputation as a trusted adviser to build on a business model that gets beyond relying solely on commissions from selling insurance to billing clients directly for consultations. In addition to increasing business from commissions, this has allowed the firm to further bolster revenues, even as some companies wrangle with reducing their insurance offerings to employees, including slashing health-care benefits because of sky-high costs in that sector.\n\n\u201cThere is a shift going to fee for service,\u201d said Jon Loftin, MJ\u2019s president and chief operating officer.\n\nMuch of the company\u2019s income, such as from the work it does for Lewis Wagner, still comes from commissions tied to insurance premiums paid by clients, a traditional business model for insurance brokers. But Loftin says MJ now charges a growing number of clients directly for consultative services.\n\nWith direct fees, unlike commissions, he said, there\u2019s no built-in financial incentive to sell clients additional insurance.\n\n\u201cMore times than not, we\u2019re trying to get them less insurance rather than more, and that sounds counterintuitive,\u201d he said, but it also can save clients money on premiums. \u201cIf there\u2019s a low risk that they feel the company can handle on their balance sheet, why cede that to an insurance company?\u201d\n\nMJ\u2019s consultative services include advising on how provisions in the Affordable Care Act will affect a business and how to navigate changes, an area where MJ has intentionally honed its expertise to meet client demand.\n\nThe focus on advising follows the company\u2019s internal emphasis on professional and personal improvement for its 130 employees, 110 in Indianapolis and 20 in MJ\u2019s Phoenix office. That, too, has an impact on clients MJ serves in all 50 states and 16 countries in sectors ranging from sororities to mining companies and construction firms.\n\n\u201cThis development and goal-setting, it pours out of every team member and it\u2019s very infectious to current and prospective clients,\u201d said Ryan Michalowski , director of human resources for Defender Direct, an MJ client. The provider of ADT Security Services systems, as well as HVAC and plumbing, headquartered in Indianapolis, employs 2,200 nationwide.\n\nRecently, Michalowski said, MJ advised Defender Direct on how it could take a proactive approach to worker safety training following acquisitions of HVAC companies in 2012 and 2013.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re more concerned about how they can make your company more successful,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about \u2018Let me sell you something.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMJ Insurance\u2022 What: insurance agency providing commercial insurance, risk management, employee benefits and HR consulting.\u2022 Headquarters: Indianapolis.\u2022 Leader: Michael H.
