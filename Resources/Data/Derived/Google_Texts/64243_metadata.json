Hospital personnel gave him more morphine. He had heart disease, kidney failure and other complications.\n\nFederal law and hospice regulations allowed Yourshaw to administer his doses, and permitted caregivers and family members to give him pain medication, Fanelli said.\n\nThe State Attorney General's Office argued that Mancini intentionally \u201caided or solicited\u201d Yourshaw to commit suicide. Senior Deputy Attorney General Anthony Forray cited testimony from a preliminary hearing at which Pottsville police Capt. Steve Durkin said Mancini told him that her father wanted to die and she gave him morphine.\n\nMancini reportedly told a hospice supervisor in a phone call that she \u201chad fulfilled his wish,\u201d Forray argued in court papers.\n\nJudge Jacqueline Russell did not rule immediately on whether the case goes forward. The charge of assisted suicide is a felony.\n\nEnd-of-life questions are likely to arise more often as millions of baby boomers age, said Alan Meisel, a University of Pittsburgh law professor with the university's Center for Bioethics and Health Law. That generation spanned 1946 to 1964, when more than 76 million babies were born in the United States.\n\n\u201cMany of us have dealt with those issues with our parents,\u201d he said.\n\nFour states have some type of law described by advocates as \u201caid in dying\u201d statutes. Ore-gon's law, which took effect in 1988, was the first. It provides for physician-assisted suicide. Montana, Washington and Vermont approved laws within the past five years, Meisel said.\n\n\u201cIt's very important to realize the Mancini case, if it were in Oregon, wouldn't have been covered by the law,\u201d he said.\n\nMeisel believes \u201cthere is a slow movement toward legalization. My guess is in the next 25 years, we'll see a fair number of states adopting a variation of the Oregon law.\u201d\n\nA bill pending in the Pennsylvania Senate would enable a terminally ill patient to request in writing a dose of lethal medication from a physician. Only the doctor could administer the drug \u2014 in front of two witnesses, one of them a relative. The Senate Judiciary Committee is reviewing the \u201cdeath with dignity\u201d bill by Sen. Daylin Leach, D-Montgomery County.\n\nThe argument in Mancini's case pits the state's interest in preserving life against whether a terminally ill patient can take a lethal dose of medication with assistance.\n\nA group called Compassion & Choices in Denver filed a friend of the court brief to support Mancini, arguing the \u201ctrumped-up case\u201d has broad implications, spokesman Sean Crowley said.\n\n\u201cBarbara Mancini is Everywoman,\u201d Barbara Coombs Lee, the group's president, said. \u201cWomen across the country are in the same situation. It's not a crime to hand medication to a dying patient, even if it hastens death.\u201d\n\nLee, a former emergency room nurse, believes Attorney General Kathleen Kane could use prosecutorial discretion in this case.\n\n\u201cThese decisions are very, very personal,\u201d Lee said.\n\nJoe Peters, a spokesman for Kane, said her office took the case because the Schuylkill County district attorney had a conflict of interest. Peters said prosecutors had no choice but to follow the law.\n\n\u201cContinued prosecution of Barbara Mancini will have a chilling effect on millions of other families who fear that providing home hospice care for their dying relatives could put them in prison,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cThis outcome would be tragic.\u201d\n\nBut Michael Ciccocioppo, executive director of Pennsylvania Pro-Life Federation, said it is \u201cfundamentally wrong\u201d to help someone commit suicide, even if the person is dying and in pain. A former hospital administrator, Ciccocioppo said pain can be managed. When he worked at Holy Spirit Hospital, \u201cpain control and management\u201d was a priority.\n\n\u201cThe state of Pennsylvania has a compelling interest in preventing people from doing that,\u201d he said about suicide. \u201cYou're a citizen of this state. Where would you draw the line if certain people are allowed to commit suicide?\u201d\n\nThe Pro-Life Federation reviewed Oregon records showing why people requested lethal doses of medication. The top reason was that they fear losing autonomy and ability to care for themselves. The second-most common reason was a fear of being unable to participate in things they once did.\n\n\u201cYou have to go to number six before you find fear of inadequate pain control,\u201d Ciccocioppo said.\n\nMancini cannot talk about her motivations because of a court-imposed gag order on those involved in the case. She spoke briefly before her hearing about \u201cthe terrible year\u201d she and her husband, Joe, have experienced.\n\nJoe Mancini works two shifts as a paramedic to make up for lost income while she remains on unpaid leave from a hospital, and their legal bills are piling up, Crowley said.\n\nMancini's mother, 84, is \u201csuffering great stress,\u201d and Mancini worries about the case's effects on her two teenage daughters, he said.\n\nBrad Bumsted is Trib Total Media's state Capitol reporter.
