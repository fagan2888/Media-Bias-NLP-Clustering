Stiviano, King filed a lawsuit in L.A. Superior Court on Monday alleging that Sterling confronted her with a \u201csteady stream of racially and sexually offensive comments\u201d after the end of their relationship from 2005 and 2011.\n\nAfter the relationship ended, King reportedly remained Sterling\u2018s assistant. This is when King claims Sterling made the bulk of his comments.\n\nSome of Sterling\u2019s alleged comments that King rounds up in her lawsuit, according to the Hollywood Reporter: \u201cI want to take you out of the black world and put you into the white world\u2026\u201d and \u201cBlack people do not take care of their children; all they do is sit at home and smoke dope\u2026\u201d and \u201cWhy would you bring black people into the world?\u201d\n\nWhile she was married to an African-American man (during their relationship), Sterling also allegedly commented, \u201cHow could you be married to a black man?\u201d Even after King and her husband broke up, Sterling would tell her when they\u2019d fight that she should \u201cmove back to the ghetto with a black man.\u201d\n\nMaiko Maya King, once employed by Sterling, also alleges that he \u201cdangled money only if she would have sex with him,\u201d telling King that he had grown \u201cbored with V.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit, brought by celebrity attorney Gloria Allred, claims that when Sterling wouldn\u2019t cease making racial and sexual comments at King\u2019s request, he fired her on May 7.\n\nSterling\u2019s attorney, Bobby Samini, told the Los Angeles Times that King\u2019s allegations are \u201ccompletely baseless,\u201d since \u201canyone objectively reviewing Ms. King\u2019s claims will have no doubt that they are without merit.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, with Sterling out of the NBA, Steve Ballmer, former CEO at Microsoft, was recently confirmed to be the new owner of the Clippers. He reportedly paid $2 billion for the throne.\n\nAccording to Barron\u2019s, the price easily sets the record for any professional sports deal ever made:\n\nThe $2 billion bid from Ballmer also topped the highest price tag for an NBA team, the $550 million paid recently for the Milwaukee Bucks, admittedly in a far smaller market than Los Angeles. Indeed, the bid for the Clippers is only eclipsed in North America by the $2.1 billion paid two years ago for the L.A. Dodgers, perennially strong contenders in the National League West and with a rich television deal. The Clippers have never have made it to the NBA finals, let alone won a championship.\n\nThough some wonder if Ballmer will be able to make a profit with such a sizable sticker price, others are quick to note that with a net worth of about $20 billion, Ballmer doesn\u2019t really need to think about profit at all.\n\nHe\u2019s already got the support of legendary basketball great Magic Johnson, who Sterling openly slammed for being HIV positive. After all this Sterling nonsense, Johnson tweeted that Clippers fans were bound to \u201clove Steve Ballmer.\u201d\n\n[Image courtesy of Uptown Magazine]", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you've never heard of Maiko Maya King, that's soon to change.
