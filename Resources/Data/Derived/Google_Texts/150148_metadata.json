And as he thinks ahead to voting for the first time in a presidential election, he expects to follow the lead of the union that has negotiated job security, healthcare benefits and a paycheck far above the state\u2019s minimum wage.\n\nTRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>\n\n\u201cWe really are a family,\u201d he said on a recent afternoon, seated in the arid garden of his stepmother\u2019s single-story house. \u201cAnd the union has taken care of me like my family.\u201d\n\nNo wonder that as Democratic presidential hopefuls arrived here this week for their first debate, they also had their eyes on the Culinary Union.\n\nNot only does the union boast the largest membership of any labor organization in Nevada -- 55,000 workers who wax corridors, serve cocktails and prepare food for the roughly 50 million tourists who come to the state each year -- but more than half of its members are Latinos, whose support is critical to a Democrat vying to win the state\u2019s caucuses or to carry the state in a general election.\n\nThe union has sometimes endorsed Republicans, as it did last year when it backed Gov. Brian Sandoval for reelection, but it is typically on the Democrats\u2019 side, often to great effect.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a group of that size willing to put resources into a campaign, it\u2019s powerful,\u201d said David Damore, an associate professor of political science at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. Unlike in some states, \u201cthere is no need for a new mobilization effort of Latino voters here in Nevada,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat they have is consistent and will be there.\u201d\n\nSee the most-read stories this hour >>\n\nSo far this cycle, the Culinary Union, which is affiliated with the national labor group Unite Here, has not offered an endorsement, although officials say one might come in January, in advance of the Nevada caucuses, scheduled for February. Behind the scenes, campaign aides to Hillary Rodham Clinton, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley are vying for its support.\n\nClinton showed up Monday at a union picket line in front of the Trump International Hotel, offering her support for the union. O'Malley joined a similar picket line during the summer. While in Nevada earlier this year, Sanders held a town-hall meeting focused on economics at the union\u2019s headquarters. And Vice President Joe Biden, who is considering a presidential run, met privately in Los Angeles last month with the Culinary Union president.\n\nThe quest for union support already appears to have had an impact on the candidates\u2019 positions on at least one issue. Clinton, Sanders and O\u2019Malley have all called for repeal of the \u201cCadillac tax\u201d in the Affordable Care Act, a 40% levy on certain generous employer-sponsored health coverage plans, which is set to take effect in 2018.\n\nGetting rid of that tax is a prime issue for the Culinary Union and other labor organizations that have negotiated substantial benefit plans for their members. The Culinary Union has been running Spanish-language radio ads in Las Vegas urging Democratic candidates to help push legislation in Congress to repeal the tax.\n\nPassing comprehensive immigration reform is another key issue for the union, whose membership includes workers from more than 160 countries.\n\n\u201cWe are no doubt an immigrant union,\u201d said Yvanna Cancela, the union\u2019s political director. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about the Latino vote and immigrant vote in Nevada, you\u2019re really talking about our members and their families.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP for the free Essential Politics newsletter >>\n\nBrenda Flores is from one of those families. She works alongside her mother, Maria, a union member for 21 years, at the Flamingo hotel, where she\u2019s a food and beverage cashier.\n\nMany union members, like Flores and Montano, have family members who they say have been seeking legal status for decades but have been bogged down by an inefficient system.\n\n\u201cYou know people who just want to feel secure and safe,\u201d Flores said. \u201cYou know, go to work and know that they\u2019ll be able to come home to their families and not be split up.\u201d\n\nMontano has an uncle in Michigan who has been in the country illegally for more than 20 years.\n\n\u201cHe works, he wants to contribute to society,\u201d Montano said. \u201cIn many ways, he\u2019s an American, he\u2019s lived here so long.\u201d\n\nOn a recent weekday, Montano huddled in an air-conditioned office at the union\u2019s headquarters making phone calls with colleagues in an effort to boost turnout for a rally at the Trump hotel. Their mission: target Donald Trump, the billionaire businessman and GOP presidential front-runner, over his immigration policies and his opposition to collective bargaining. None of the workers at the Trump hotel here are unionized.\n\n\u201cThey are not serious about where this country is headed,\u201d Montano said of Republicans, dismissing proposals from Trump such as building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nBoth Flores and Montano said they were likely to back whomever the union endorses in the Democratic primary.\n\nIn 2008, Flores voted for then-Sen. Barack Obama after he won the union's endorsement.\n\nThat year, a bitter dispute ensued after the union announced its support. Accusations of voter intimidation led to a lawsuit -- supported by some Clinton allies -- that would have banned caucus sites inside some casinos. Some Obama allies assailed the Clinton campaign, accusing it of trying to disenfranchise Latino voters.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Democratic candidates court Culinary Union, the kingmaker of Nevada", "Description": "When Edgar Montano first moved here two years ago, his work at a carwash offered sporadic hours, dismal pay and no job security.
