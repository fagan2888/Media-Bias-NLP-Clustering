Arne for governor?

ARNE FOR GOVERNOR? Is Education Secretary Arne Duncan’s next move going head-to-head with Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner, a Republican, in 2018? A source familiar with Prairie State politics says Duncan has been pitched on the idea before. And while he listened, Duncan decided it wasn’t the right move. Should he change his mind, it would be the first time Duncan has ever run for elected office. But after Duncan recently announced his resignation, saying he’d like to spend more time with his family, it’s unlikely that he’d put his family through the wringer of a gubernatorial race, the source said.

— Speaking of former Chicago school district leaders: After pleading guilty [ http://politico.pro/1GdIMY7 ] earlier this week to charges that she steered multimillion dollar no-bid contracts to two education firms in exchange for kickbacks and perks, former Chicago Public Schools CEO Barbara Byrd-Bennett is now being scrutinized for her tenure in Detroit. Byrd-Bennett was the chief academic and accountability auditor for Detroit Public Schools from 2009 to 2011. One of the firms involved in the Chicago scandal was also awarded contracts with Detroit Public Schools while Byrd-Bennett was on the job. More from The Detroit News: http://detne.ws/1QtXQ4g .

EX SITES AND ACCESS: The Education Department published plans for its latest experimental site in the Federal Register today [ http://bit.ly/1hEF3ag ], getting into the nitty-gritty of what colleges need to do to partner with non-traditional education providers, such as MOOCs and coding boot camps, to create new, cohesive programs eligible for federal financial aid. Among the highlights that Allie Grasgreen Ciaramella reported for Pros are details on the “quality assurance entity”, the independent monitor colleges will select to make sure their experimental programs are up to department standards. Officials noted that employer associations, accreditors and accounting firms could all be contenders for the role: http://politico.pro/1NHH2sZ .

— The new monitoring bodies will focus primarily on student outcomes, and the role could be an opportunity for accreditors, said Judith Eaton, president of the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. But the new position will also be a challenge to the current system, she said: “These could be a new type of quality review body to which the federal government is turning — unprecedented for many decades.”

— New America Policy Analyst Alexander Holt is underwhelmed by the proposal, however, noting in a blog post that the programs the department wants to boost have thrived without the agency’s involvement, and their innovative spirit could be squelched by the interference. “There once was another highly innovative industry that federal aid ruined. For-profit companies using online distance learning tools were seen as a brand new way to educate students at lower costs,” Holt writes. “What we failed to understand was that online programs were only innovative when they had to survive in a real market. In 2006, schools were no longer required to teach at least 50 percent of the program on campus, thus opening up the crazy online degrees we have now with little or no evidence they lead to positive outcomes for students. So too would the boot camps.” More: http://bit.ly/1LuwJWQ .

— The department is especially interested in programs that make a difference for low-income students, and programs can opt to accept students who only receive Pell grants, or open up to those with other aid, as well. But when it comes to measuring success among the less wealthy, looking at Pell may be misleading, CollegeNET says. Its annual Social Mobility Index, which ranks colleges based on how well they advance low-income students through to well-paying careers, found that at least half of Pell grants at 20 colleges are going to students from the upper half of the population: http://bit.ly/1jAgI6U .

— We reported a few weeks back on the growing number of colleges using MOOCs to offer “Freshman Year For Free” through a Modern States Education Alliance initiative [ http://politi.co/1NdjNUB ]. This fall, the University of Texas System became the largest state institution in the country to start down that path, offering four courses (with a fifth on the way) that let high school students earn college credit through the edX platform. The courses aren’t part of the MSEA initiative, but they will be available on the alliance’s website. The average first-time student attending UT-Austin comes in with 15 credits already under her belt, said Steven Mintz, executive director of the UT System’s Institute for Transformational Learning. “We’re going to try to play an active role in this area,” he said. “We’re also trying to break through the iron triangle of affordability, access and student success, and we see this as a step in the right direction.” More: http://bit.ly/1jAgI6U .

— In another effort to plug the high-school-to-college pipeline, the American Association of Community Colleges and the Association of Community College Trustees signed on to Higher Ed for Higher Standards, promising to work with their institutions and K-12 districts to increase college readiness. Over the next year the groups will run advocacy and educational programs designed to raise expectations starting in K-12 and support student success in higher education. About half of the coalition’s 350 members are community colleges. AACC and ACCT have a joint statement here: http://bit.ly/1K9LoRU .

COLLEGE GRADUATION GAPS: Students who attend low-income, urban schools serving a high concentration of minority students enroll in and graduate from college at disproportionately lower rates than students attending predominantly white urban and suburban schools. That’s according to an annual report released today by the National Student Clearinghouse. About a fifth of high school graduates from low-income, high minority schools graduated from college within six years, compared to about half of students who graduated from higher income urban and suburban schools serving fewer minority students.

— On a related note: Arizona, Massachusetts and Minnesota are splitting $600,000 in grants from America’s Promise Alliance and Pearson to increase high school graduation rates. Massachusetts plans to use the money to create a state coalition of 10 school districts that will work to improve graduation rates for English language learners. More: http://bit.ly/1X4BgTJ .

DISTRICT BLAMES OBAMACARE FOR CLOSING SCHOOLS: A small school district in northern Tennessee says it has canceled [ http://tnne.ws/1jAxFye ] classes because of Obamacare. Clay County Director of Schools Jerry Strong said [ http://slate.me/1RIG6Dh ] the district has been struggling financially for the last three years and just can’t come up with the money to pay for the “totally unfunded mandate.” "The straw that broke the camel's back was really the Affordable Care Act for us and it has made it very difficult for us to have our employees properly covered and meet the mandates of the law,” he said. “That was going to require new revenue and the commission felt like they couldn't do that through a tax increase." While the county won’t raise property taxes to fund the schools, a proposed wheel tax referendum vote in March might ease the financial burden.

— If the referendum doesn’t pass, school officials still have time to address the issue, County Commissioner Parrish Wright said, noting that there’s enough money to get through the end of the school year. But Strong said he wants to address the revenue issue now because the district’s finances could tank by the end of the school year. He and others decided to close schools to bring the issue to the forefront. Two parents are suing to keep the schools open: http://bit.ly/1QtUmyO .

SUPES STRESS LIFELINE OVERHAUL: Nearly 200 school district superintendents have written the Federal Communications Commission pushing for an update to the Lifeline program. Modernizing the program could provide more low-income students with high-speed broadband at home and help solve what’s called the “Homework Gap,” they write. The letter: http://bit.ly/1hEWlEg .

CHARTER GRANT CONTROVERSY CONTINUES IN OHIO: The pushback over a federal charter schools grant awarded to Ohio continues: The Cincinnati Educational Justice Coalition has written Education Secretary Arne Duncan to say the group is extremely disappointed with the grant — the largest awarded to any state in the latest round of funding through the Charter Schools Program — adding that the money should go to traditional public schools instead. “The most affected by these failures are Ohio’s public school children, but few consequences are ever seen by those who profited,” the group writes. “Yet, once again the charter school model is rewarded.” The Education Department has contended that special conditions were placed on Ohio’s grant and federal officials are monitoring the state.

WHITE HOUSE UNVEILS TARGETED ANTI-BULLYING INITIATIVE: In the midst of National Bullying Prevention Month, the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders announced today a new public awareness campaign to tackle bullying, particularly in the AAPI community. The “Act to Change” campaign will seek to help students, families and educators prevent and end bullying through an organizing toolkit, video testimonials and music playlists. The campaign website, ActToChange.org , also offers a pledge visitors can sign in support of this effort. Resources are available in Chinese, Hindi, Korean, Punjabi, Urdu, and Vietnamese. “Bullying is a major civil rights issue for the Asian American and Pacific Islander community in particular,” Initiative Executive Director Kiran Ahuja explained. [ http://bit.ly/1Mrh47b ] “We’ve seen too often AAPI groups, including Sikh, Muslim, Micronesian, LGBT, and limited English proficient youth, targeted for bullying and harassment.”

— The AAPI Bullying Prevention Task Force was announced in November 2014 alongside several White House initiatives designed to combat hate crimes and hate incidents. The group focuses on identifying what keeps people from reporting bullying and harassment, analyzing data on bullying cases, and developing ways to boost federal government outreach.
