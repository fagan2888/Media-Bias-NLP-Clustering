GREENSBORO, N.C. -- Greensboro resident Larry Holmquist has entered the 2016 U.S. Senate primary to challenge incumbent Richard Burr.

"We need a good, strong conservative in the United States Senate," Holmquist said. "And that's why I decided to run against Mr. Burr."

Holmquist, 61, was born in Illinois and moved to the Triad in 1988, where he worked in advertising until his retirement in 2001.

Holmquist said he decided to run because he felt Burr does not vote along conservative lines.

"I can tell you the exact day I decided to do this. It was on Sept. 27, 2013. That was the day that Mr. Burr voted to approve Obamacare. And I said, 'That's it, I'm going to run against Mr. Burr.'"

Holmquist has never held political office but said he is running to provide a conservative voice for North Carolinians.

"I think we've got too many men and women in D.C. who are there for the wrong reasons. They're there for money, or power or ego. And I don't care about any of those three. I'm going because I love my country," he said.

Holmquist said his top priority, if elected, would be national defense.

"If we're either unable or unwilling to defend our nation against terrorism or God forbid some kind of nuclear attack, then nothing else matters. Health care, education, energy, nothing else matters if we can't defend this country."
