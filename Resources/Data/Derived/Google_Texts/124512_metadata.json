It includes $523.9 billion in base discretionary spending, a $2.2 billion boost, and $58.8 billion for the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) account, commonly referred to as the war fund, a $200 million increase.\n\nThe agency also laid out a five-year fiscal roadmap that anticipates the Pentagon\u2019s expected base budgets through 2021. The amount jumps to $556.7 billion in 2018, then goes to $564.8 billion, $570.4 billion and finally $585.2 billion.\n\nSince this blueprint will be the last one produced before a new administration takes over, those numbers will likely change.\n\n\u201cPresidential budget requests are just that: requests. They are the starting point for negotiation but typically a decent indicator of general trend lines,\u201d said Mackenzie Eaglen, a defense analyst at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nBut, she noted, the the five-year plan exceeds the spending caps enacted by both Obama and a Republican Congress by $113 billion, making it a less reliable future indicator. And unlike other federal agencies, the Pentagon has never accounted for what it spends--it's never had an audit.\n\nRelated: As National Debt Hits $19 Trillion, a Spending Showdown Looms in Congress\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not unlikely that the numbers will grow, considering the tough talk that has dominated the 2016 campaign trail and the willingness by Congress to raise spending ceilings.\n\nFor example, all of the top-tier Republicans contenders have charged that the military has been \u201cgutted\u201d by Obama and needs a major cash infusion to combat threats such as ISIS and compete with technological rivals including Russia and China.\n\nThe candidates have promised to grow the Army and Marine Corps by the thousands, build more ships for the Navy and deliver more jets for the Air Force all the while revamping the country\u2019s nuclear deterrent and investing in new technologies.\n\nThe promises add up to hundreds of millions if not billions in new spending that would likely sail through a Republican-controlled Congress that has long chided Obama for short-changing efforts to confront the threats facing the country.\n\nIt\u2019s less clear how the numbers might grow under a Democratic presidency. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has avoided getting into specifics when it comes to the U.S. military, other than saying he wants to avoid sending troops into another \u201cquagmire\u201d in the Middle East. In a town hall event last week, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton wouldn\u2019t rule out the use of military force around the globe, which could impose new costs on the Pentagon.\n\nRelated: CBO Predicts First Deficit Spike Since 2009\n\nIn the meantime, there is already pressure to increase spending. Congressional defense hawks argue the war fund amount, the minimum set by the two-year budget accord, isn\u2019t enough.\n\nOn Monday, 33 members of the influential House Armed Services Committee, led by chair Mac Thornberry (R-TX), sent a \u201cviews and estimates\u201d letter to the head of the House Budget Committee asking for another $23 billion for the war fund in the GOP\u2019s budget blueprint, which will be unveiled later this month.\n\n\"We believe that an adequate national defense requires significantly more funding,\" the letter said.\n\nWhile congressional budgets don\u2019t become law, they do serve as a guide for appropriators who hammer out the 12 annual spending bills that fund the federal government.\n\nThe war funding number for 2017 is likely to rise anyway, regardless of congressional meddling.\n\nFor instance, the proposed $200 million increase for OCO is for \u201ctransregional\u201d threats in Africa, Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work said Tuesday at a Pentagon briefing.\n\nThat\u2019s an allusion to Libya, a nation where the Islamic State is on the rise and where Obama is considering opening a third front against the terror group. Should the president decide to send troops there, the OCO coffers would need more cash. Overall, anti-ISIS efforts receive a 50 percent bump in the proposed budget, rising from $5 billion to $7.5 billion.\n\nIn addition, right now $41.7 billion in OCO funds are for the Afghanistan war. That amount fully funds the president\u2019s plan to cut the U.S. military footprint from around 9,800 troops to 5,500 around the end of the calendar year, according to Work.\n\nHowever, the president is reportedly considering ditching his drawdown plans and leaving the current force level in place for his successor. Keeping 4,300 troops in Afghanistan would inevitably add to the price tag of a war that has already cost the U.S. nearly $65 billion.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "President Obama\u2019s final Defense Department budget request shows that no matter who succeeds him in the Oval Office next year, Democrat or Republican, the Pentagon\u2019s coffers will likely continue to get more and more taxpayer money.", "title": "Half a Trillion for the Pentagon?
