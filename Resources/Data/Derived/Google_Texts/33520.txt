NEW YORK (MainStreet) â€” If you're one of the estimated 6 million Americans expected to be hit with a tax penalty for not signing up for mandatory health insurance in 2014, Uncle Sam is offering a lifeline of sorts.

The federal government is offering a special enrollment period around tax filing season for those who have to pay the penalty for 2014, who didn't know about the penalty and who live in any of the 37 states served by healthcare.gov, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

The sign-up extension runs through April 30.

"At least for this year, tax season will bring many Americans a last-minute chance to get enrolled, and that's great news," says Egon Smola, senior vice president and general manager of consumer business at GetInsured, a cloud-based health insurance exchange platform. "This doesn't take the sting out of having to pay a penalty for 2014, but it does allow those consumers to get coverage for 2015."

Under the Affordable Care Act, adults have to sign up for health insurance or pay a tax penalty. But the Urban Institute says that 40% of Americans don't know they're about to get hit with the ACA tax, payable when filing their 2014 taxes.

The penalty is $95 per uninsured adult ($47.50 per uninsured child), or 1% of household income, whichever is higher. The tax rises significantly in 2015 to a $325 fine or 2% of your annual income, whichever is higher.Signing up late also doesn't mean you avoid a 2015 tax penalty, Smola notes. "You may still owe a partial penalty based on the number of months [you] were uninsured," he says.
