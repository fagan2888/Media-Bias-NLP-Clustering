(Photo: Melissa Lyttle / for USA TODAY)\n\nPhysician Praveen Arla is witnessing a reversal of health care fortunes: Poor, long-uninsured patients are getting Medicaid through Obamacare and finally coming to his office for care. But middle-class workers are increasingly staying away.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s flip-flopped,\u201d says Arla, who helps his father run a family practice in Hillview, Ky. Patients with job-based plans, he says, will say, \u201cMy deductible is so high. I\u2019m trying to come to the doctor as little as possible. \u2026 What is the minimum I can get done? They\u2019re really worried about cost.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a deep and common concern across the USA, where employer plans cover 60 percent of working-age Americans, or about 150 million people. Coverage long considered the gold standard of health insurance often requires workers to pay so much out-of-pocket that many skip doctor visits, put off medical procedures and ration pills, much as the uninsured have done.\n\nA recent Commonwealth Fund survey found that four in 10 working-age adults skipped some kind of care because of cost. The portion of workers with annual deductibles \u2014 what consumers must pay before insurance kicks in \u2014 rose from 55 percent eight years ago to 80 percent today, according to research by the Kaiser Family Foundation. A Mercer study showed that 2014 saw the largest one-year increase in enrollment in \u201chigh-deductible plans\u201d \u2014 from 18 percent to 23 percent of all covered employees.\n\nThe size of the average deductible more than doubled in eight years, from $584 to $1,217 for individual coverage. Add this to co-pays, co-insurance and the price of drugs or procedures not covered, and it\u2019s all too much for many Americans.\n\nLocally, prices have risen, but at a much smaller rate than nationally, according to Dr. Chris Jones, CEO of Vantage Health Plan in Monroe.\n\n\u201cLouisiana has been pretty good in the exchange plans,\u201d he said. \u201cDeductibles are a little higher than what you\u2019d find in Medicare or large group, but deductibles as a whole are not nearly as high as other states.\u201d\n\nLaRita Jacobs of Seminole, Fla., who gets insurance through her husband\u2019s job and has an annual family income of $70,000, says $7,500 a year in out-of-pocket costs kept her from dealing with an arthritis-related neck problem until it got so bad she couldn\u2019t lift a fork. She finally got treatment in October, but she\u2019s putting off shoulder surgery, opting for less expensive physical therapy and planning to \u201ctough out the pain.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did we get to this crazy life?\u201d asks Jacobs, 54. \u201cWe\u2019re struggling to pay our bills like we were struggling when we first got started.\u201d\n\nWhy is this happening? Many patients and doctors blame corporate greed \u2014 a view insurers and business leaders reject. Some employers in turn blame the Affordable Care Act, saying it has forced them to pare down generous plans so they don\u2019t have to pay a \u201cCadillac tax\u201d on high-cost coverage in 2018.\n\nHealth care researchers point to a convergence of trends building for years: the steep rise in deductibles even as premiums stabilize, corporate belt-tightening and stagnant middle-class wages.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a case of companies trying to offer workers health insurance and still generate profit,\u201d said Eric Wright, a professor of sociology and public health at Georgia State University. \u201cBut whenever costs go up for the consumers \u2026 it promotes a delay in care.\u201d\n\nOthers disagree, saying that when people pay for their care, they shop more intelligently. Chris Riedl, Aetna\u2019s head of product strategy for its national accounts, says Aetna\u2019s research does not indicate that insured patients are showing up sick in emergency rooms with long-neglected illnesses \u2014 which to her means, \u201cintuitively, they\u2019re not avoiding care.\u201d\n\nMany doctors contend it\u2019s only a matter of time before the middle class begins crowding ERs. They say putting off care can be dangerous, exponentially more costly and, if it continues, can threaten the nation\u2019s health.\n\nMonitor the trend\n\nPraveen\u2019s father, Mohana Arla, says being forced to pay so much out-of-pocket \u201cis as good as not having insurance\u201d in an era of ever-rising health care costs. Out-of-pocket maximums can easily exceed $10,000 a year for families, and median household income is about $53,000.\n\n\u201cHealth expenses tend to come up unexpectedly, or if you have a chronic condition, they come up relentlessly,\u201d says Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at Kaiser. \u201cPeople put off care or they split their pills. They do without.\u201d\n\nResearch backs that up: Nearly 30 percent of privately insured, working-age Americans with deductibles of at least 5 percent of their income had a medical problem but didn\u2019t go to the doctor, a 2014 survey by the Commonwealth Fund found. About the same percentage skipped medical tests, treatments or follow-ups.\n\nNearly half of middle-class workers skipped health care services or fell into financial hardship because of health expenses, according to a survey by the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nPatients often do a sort of medical and financial triage when they get sick. Jacobs says every time a doctor suggests a new test or medication for her arthritis, she asks herself, \u201cIs it critical? You\u2019re always playing the odds.\u201d\n\nThough all out-of-pocket expenses play a role in such decisions, experts say the driving factor is the deductible, which averages $2,000 or more for single coverage for nearly one in five workers and from $2,000 to $4,500 for families, depending on the type of plan. Companies may help fund health savings accounts to pay some of these costs.\n\n\u201cI can remember when $1,000 was considered a high-deductible plan. Now that\u2019s become kind of the norm,\u201d Pollitz says.\n\nObamacare to blame?\n\nSince the ACA took effect, \u201cthere\u2019s been an accelerated movement\u201d to these types of plans, says Brian Marcotte, president of the Washington-based Business Group on Health.\n\nMarcotte, whose group represents 400 large employers, says the looming Cadillac tax is a factor but acknowledges that managing health care costs is another.\n\nDeAnn Friedholm of Consumers Union says she\u2019s skeptical when employers point to the ACA. \u201cThis isn\u2019t new,\u201d she says. \u201cCompanies have been cutting back on benefits and cutting costs for decades.\u201d\n\nPollitz says the ACA holds down the consumer burden by capping out-of-pocket expenses at $6,300 a person \u2014 which, although that amount is \u201cmore than most people have in the bank,\u201d is better than no cap at all.\n\nThe ACA requires preventive care to be covered fully and exempt from deductibles. Jones said that requirement is beneficial.\n\n\u201cI think people are more inclined to go get their wellness exams now that it\u2019s not going to cost them anything, and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he said.\n\nUgly side effects\n\nWhen consumers skip care, they enter a downward spiral that imperils their physical and financial health, especially for problems that could have been caught early with an annual checkup.\n\n\u201cPeople with diabetes may go for several years and not know they have it because they don\u2019t feel particularly bad,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThose first few years when they have it, that\u2019s the best opportunity. It may be treated with dietary changes (if caught early). Where if you wait two or three years, you\u2019re going to have to take some medicine.\u201d\n\nInsurers, employers and others say that high deductibles generally encourage people to seek the best value for their dollar.\n\nTime heals all?\n\nThere are no signs high deductibles are going away. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services last month cited these plans as one of the reasons health care spending hit a record low in 2013.\n\nAmericans will need to take further steps to control their health costs.\n\nAt home in Louisiana, Jones, the CEO of Vantage, said the future may look a bit brighter.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll see in the next year or two that deductibles will get smaller in Louisiana,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a lot of options in Louisiana that they don\u2019t have in some states.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnsne.ws/1BfDiHa", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Rather than pay so much out-of-pocket, many skip checkups, scrimp on care", "og": {"site_name": "thenewsstar.com", "description": "Rather than pay so much out-of-pocket, many skip checkups, scrimp on care", "title": "Deductible costs cripple the middle class", "url": "http://www.thenewsstar.com/story/news/local/2015/01/02/deductible-costs-cripple-middle-class/21214329/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/thenewsstar.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rather than pay so much out-of-pocket, many skip checkups, scrimp on care", "title": "Deductible costs cripple the middle class", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f783f76a7f9922eb00bf6fdfece3cb2a69f097db/c=665-0-3335-2670&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Monroe/2015/01/02/B9315720377Z.1_20150102210240_000_G7T9IQIO9.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@thenewsstar", "site": "@thenewsstar", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=820377811", "fb": {"app_id": 174541472579431}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Marcotte, whose group represents 400 large employers, says the looming Cadillac tax is a factor but acknowledges that managing health care costs is another.\nAmericans will need to take further steps to control their health costs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a case of companies trying to offer workers health insurance and still generate profit,\u201d said Eric Wright, a professor of sociology and public health at Georgia State University.\n(Photo: Melissa Lyttle / for USA TODAY)Physician Praveen Arla is witnessing a reversal of health care fortunes: Poor, long-uninsured patients are getting Medicaid through Obamacare and finally coming to his office for care.\nMonitor the trendPraveen\u2019s father, Mohana Arla, says being forced to pay so much out-of-pocket \u201cis as good as not having insurance\u201d in an era of ever-rising health care costs."}
