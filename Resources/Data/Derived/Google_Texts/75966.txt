On the heels of the now Oscar-nominated film "The Wolf of Wall Street," tonight, the man whose autobiography inspired the film joins "Piers Morgan Live" for a live, hour-long, face to face interview.

Depicted on screen by legendary Hollywood icon Leonardo DiCaprio, Jordan Belfort is made to be a man who employs unethical stockbroking tactics as a way to bilk investors out of hundreds of thousand of dollars.

And while the 51-year-old has no trouble admitting his shady business practices, he does take exception to the way the movie portrays the relationship with his family. In fact, he went so far as to take his eldest child to the theater so as to point out any inaccuracies:

"I took my son to the movie – he was 18 – with my ex-wife,” Belfort tells Piers Morgan. “Together, because we wanted to show him what was true.”

Belfort is particularly defensive of a controversial scene in which DiCaprio’s character kicks his wife down the stairs of their mansion home, while the couple's small daughter looked on:

“That moment was the highest I'd ever been in my life,” Belfort says of the incident. “I hadn't slept in probably two months because of all the cocaine.”

While the drug-induced high resulted in an all-time low, Belfort claims that overall he was and is a good father:

“At first ... they don't even remember because I got sober when they were still, you know, babies,” Belfort tells Morgan. “But my children are obviously proud of me and they know me for the man I am today.”

Tune in to CNN tonight at 9 for the full, exclusive interview.
