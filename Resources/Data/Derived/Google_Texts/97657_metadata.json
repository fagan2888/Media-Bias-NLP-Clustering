It\u2019s an idea that\u2019s been rolling around in Poulos\u2019 cluttered but razor-sharp brain for a while now, and he finally got it out in long form.\n\nIn short, the Pink Police State is a cultural schism that began in the late 1990s resulting in an alternating maternal nanny state and dangerously permissive personal life.\n\nWhat we have today then is something quite \u201cneo,\u201d historically speaking: a robust regulatory state that pursues health and safety at the expense of liberty in the context of a culture that demands robust interpersonal freedom. Rather than stamping out hedonistic pursuits and pleasure-centered living, 1984 style, the new statism creates a \u201csafe\u201d space for their \u201chealthy\u201d experience. Yet, rather than expanding the project limitlessly, Brave New World style, so as to make all pleasure official, the new statism tacitly acknowledges that our most potent appetites can never be fully domesticated, even with all the tools of force, surveillance, and coercion at the government\u2019s disposal.\n\nThe term Pink Police State itself is a brilliant derivation of a scene in Marilyn Manson\u2019s iconoclastic 1998 video, \u201cDope Show,\u201d in which police officers in pink riot gear alternately hold back a screaming public, dance on top of cars, and make out with each other.\n\nAlthough most political commentators identify the terrorist attacks of 9/11/01 as the formative event of our generation, Poulos instead uses the WTO protests in Seattle in 1999 (the \u201cBattle in Seattle\u201d) as the first skirmish in the battle of the Pink Police State, a much more important modern \u201cwar\u201d.\n\nA media sensation, the unrest seemed to confirm that the progress of Western democracy toward the post-communist political economy was threatened by a new, domestic adversary\u2014one quite unlike the external foe whose defeat had brought a sudden end to the Cold War. To be sure, some enemies remained abroad. In a handful of \u201crogue\u201d or \u201cfailed\u201d states, Western strategists faced a growing assortment of what Hans Magnus Enzensberger would later term \u201cradical losers\u201d\u2014terrorists, guerillas, and criminals acting beyond the reach or the view of sovereign powers. In certain troubling instances, these problem actors worked together, or even converged. But from North Korea to Afghanistan, these perils appeared mainly to be remainders and aftereffects of the Cold War. No new vision had seized power in a way that challenged the primacy of the West.\n\nSo while the War on Terror is on the decline, and 9/11 likely its last gasp, the war on global corporatism was just declared, and Seattle its first nascent cry.\n\nOver the four-story series, Poulos weaves an intricate and fascinating tapestry of pop culture references, philosophical concepts, and political arguments from Fight Club, Bridget Jones, Nietzsche, Fifty Shades of Grey, Tocqueville, Plato, Obamacare, and the Matrix. To many (read the comments at your own peril), his dense prose is nothing more than pseudointellectual psychobabble. But upon close inspection, Poulos has crafted a fascinating new lens through which people are viewing our cultural panorama.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "James Poulos,Pink Police State,political discourse,Politics,News,Blog,Current,Alternative,Libertarian,Freedom,Election,Nonpartisan,Ron Paul", "DC.Title": "The Pink Police State: James Poulos diagnoses what ails American society", "robots": "index,follow", "copyright": "(c) 2005-2013 United Liberty", "description": "PPS One month ago, James Poulos, the self-described &#8220;radicaltarian&#8221; blogger, podcaster, scholar, and musician, dropped a bomb on the political discourse with the beginning of a short (but long) series at The Federalist called the Pink"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfd1f\"", "article_summary": "In short, the Pink Police State is a cultural schism that began in the late 1990s resulting in an alternating maternal nanny state and dangerously permissive personal life.\nBut upon close inspection, Poulos has crafted a fascinating new lens through which people are viewing our cultural panorama.\nOne month ago, James Poulos, the self-described \u201cradicaltarian\u201d blogger, podcaster, scholar, and musician, dropped a bomb on the political discourse with the beginning of a short (but long) series at The Federalist called the Pink Police State.\nRather than stamping out hedonistic pursuits and pleasure-centered living, 1984 style, the new statism creates a \u201csafe\u201d space for their \u201chealthy\u201d experience.\nIt\u2019s an idea that\u2019s been rolling around in Poulos\u2019 cluttered but razor-sharp brain for a while now, and he finally got it out in long form."}
