People stood in hushed groups trying to figure out what was going wrong.\n\n\u201cIf we could catch a (darn) ball we would be good,\u201d one man said.\n\nRECAP: Broncos punch ticket to AFC championship game\n\n\u201cWe need to step it up,\u201d said a woman.\n\nBut near the end of the fourth quarter, a crowd of nearly 77,000 that had been silenced by several successful Pittsburgh drives sprung back to life with roars that shook the stadium\u2019s seats.\n\nRunning back C.J. Anderson\u2019s plow into the end zone to give the Broncos the lead with just over 3 minutes left in the game set off a wild chorus of cheers that came minutes after angry boos. It was as if a switch had flipped.\n\n\u201cI was a little worried there for a bit,\u201d said Lance Waite,Windsor.\n\nWaite said coming into the game, like others he thought the Broncos would roll over the Steelers in a quick rout to the AFC championship game. From Steelers\u2019 quarterback Ben Roethlisberger\u2019s first throw, however, Waite realized that wasn\u2019t going to be the case.\n\n\u201cHe sent a message to everyone,\u201d he said.\n\nSteelers fans were expected to come out in full force, but by game time Terrible Towel-waving supporters were scant in the seats and their cheers drowned out by a sea of tens of thousands donning orange.\n\n\u201cThank you season-ticket holders for not selling (tickets) to fans for the other team,\u201d Denver Mayor Michael Hancock said in a tweet during the game.\n\nCorina Moya, a Pittsburgh fan who drove eight hours from Artesia, N.M., to watch the battle, said she was disappointed by the lack of black and gold in the stands. She said she was expecting there to be a much larger presence.\n\nNevertheless, Moya had a positive outlook after the loss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m cool about it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe (always) support our Steelers.\u201d\n\nOther Pittsburgh supporters said they were at least proud their team gave the Broncos a run for their money. Pittsburgh had more overall yards \u2014 396 \u2014 than Denver.\n\n\u201cThe whole city of Denver really didn\u2019t think this was going to be a game,\u201d said Brian Severson, a black and gold fan who came from Chicago to watch the game.\n\nBOX SCORE: Statistics from the Broncos vs. Steelers playoff game\n\nThe Broncos say 76,877 people \u2014 a sell-out crowd \u2014 attended the game. Just 79 people with tickets did not show up.\n\nFans say they plan to be even louder next week when the Broncos take on the Patriots for a ticket to the Super Bowl.\n\n\u201cWe got this,\u201d said Brittany Koklich of Centennial. \u201cIt\u2019s in the bag, no problem.\u201d\n\nJesse Paul: 303-954-1733, jpaul@denverpost.com or @JesseAPaul", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Broncos fans ecstatic after wild win over Pittsburgh Steelers", "title": "Denver Broncos fans ecstatic after wild win over Pittsburgh Steelers", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/17/denver-broncos-fans-ecstatic-after-wild-win-over-pittsburgh-steelers/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160117__Broncos-fansp1.jpg", "height": 455}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160117__Broncos-fansp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-17T13:20:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T00:38:03+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Denver Broncos fans were screaming with joy Sunday night after their team won a wild, up and down contest with the Pittsburgh Steelers that at times left the orange faithful frustrated and anxious.\nBOX SCORE: Statistics from the Broncos vs. Steelers playoff gameThe Broncos say 76,877 people \u2014 a sell-out crowd \u2014 attended the game.\n\u201cWe (always) support our Steelers.\u201dOther Pittsburgh supporters said they were at least proud their team gave the Broncos a run for their money.\n\u201cWe took care of business.\u201dPHOTOS: Broncos vs. Steelers AFC divisional game\u201cI never doubted my boys,\u201d said Denverite Jackie Eiland of the 23-16 victory.\n\u201cThank you season-ticket holders for not selling (tickets) to fans for the other team,\u201d Denver Mayor Michael Hancock said in a tweet during the game."}
