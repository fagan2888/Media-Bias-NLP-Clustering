Nick Ut \u2014 The associated press\n\nWe\u2019ve seen the future, and it is frightening.\n\nOn Thursday, students at some of America\u2019s most prestigious colleges and universities staged a Million Student March to protest ballooning student debt, demand tuition-free higher education and call for a nationwide minimum wage of $15 an hour.\n\nThe Million Student March was also an expression of solidarity with their peers at the University of Missouri, who managed to force the resignation of school president Timothy M. Wolfe for his allegedly inadequate response to racially insensitive incidents in and around campus.\n\nThe Mizzou campus has been a hotbed of anger and agitation since the death of Michael Brown in nearby Ferguson, Missouri. A series of unrelated incidents snowballed into a major protest movement culminating in last week\u2019s toppling of president Wolfe and the stepping down of Chancellor R. Bowen Loftin.\n\nIn his letter announcing the start of a hunger strike, UM student protester Jonathan Butler alluded to incidents he claims \u201cdynamically disrupted the learning experience for marginalized (and) underrepresented students.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the past 90 days alone we have seen the MSA (Missouri Students Association) President Payton Head being called the N-word on campus, graduate students being robbed of their health insurance, Planned Parenthood services being stripped from campus, #ConcernedStudent1950 peaceful demonstrators being threatened with pepper spray, and a matter of days ago a vile and disgusting act of hatred where a MU student drew a swastika in the Gateway residential hall with their own feces.\u201d\n\nThe 1950 in Concerned Students 1950 is a reference to the year segregation ended at UM and the name of the group principally responsible for organizing the UM protests.\n\nEarlier this year MU made headlines when students circulated a petition demanding the removal of a statue of Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson, of course, was an 18th century slave owner and that makes him persona non grata on a 21st century American university campus.\n\nWhile the student debt crisis is as real as gridlock in the Sepulveda Pass and the minimum wage is always fair game for debate, the blatant racial demagoguery and class warfare that lead to the exits of President Wolfe and Chancellor Loftin should send a chill down the spine of every American.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe rhetoric and actions of UM students and faculty members make a mockery of every American value and the idea of higher education itself.\n\nMelissa Klick, a journalism professor, actually shouted for \u201cmuscle\u201d to prevent a student newspaper reporter from photographing protesters. Klick has subsequently resigned her journalism title but still teaches mass media courses, including a class on Lady Gaga.\n\nI wonder if UM offers a degree in Kardashian?\n\nHunger-striker Butler launched his protest when UM dropped health care coverage for graduate students, a real problem for Jonathan because last year his dad only earned $8 million as an executive with the Union Pacific Railroad.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, Mizzou dropped health insurance for grad students to comply with mandates under the Affordable Health Care Act, aka, Obamacare. So it appears the UM protesters toppled the wrong president.\n\nStudent Government President Payton Head didn\u2019t help the cause when he tweeted that the Ku Klux Klan had infiltrated the UM campus with the intent of gunning down students in their dorm rooms, a complete fiction. Head has since apologized.\n\nThat the majority white student body at the University of Missouri elected Head, an African-American and gay to boot, as its leader counts for nothing. Head sees himself and fellow students of color as victims of systemic racism while engaging in the very racism they claim to deplore.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, KOMU-TV reported Concerned Student 1950 segregated protesters by race, banishing white protesters \u2014 who agreed with them \u2014 so black protesters could have a \u201csafe space\u201d to themselves.\n\nMeanwhile, student government vice president Brenda Smith-Lezama appeared on MSNBC claiming, \u201cThe First Amendment creates a hostile and unsafe learning environment\u201d for students at UM.\n\nIf this craziness doesn\u2019t end UM officials won\u2019t have to remove Thomas Jefferson\u2019s statue; Jefferson will climb down from his pedestal and walk away in disgust.\n\nDoug McIntyre\u2019s column appears Sundays.
