The Little Sisters of the Poor have bigger things to worry about than Jeb Bush’s presidential announcement.

The group of nuns has been in the news for resisting a requirement that employers offer insurance covering contraception.

The former governor gave the Catholic charity a shoutout during his speech earlier today at Miami-Dade College, saying he would side with the Sisters over their Affordable Care Act objections:

“The most galling example is the shabby treatment of the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Christian charity that dared to voice objections of conscience to Obamacare. The next president needs to make it clear that great charities like the Little Sisters of the Poor need no federal instruction in doing the right thing. It comes down to a choice between the Little Sisters and Big Brother, and I’m going with the Sisters.”

But just because the Florida Republican and other politicians have made it a habit to mention the Sisters during their campaign speeches, doesn’t mean they’re all watching from Little Sisters HQ.

During the day, the sisters are too busy taking care of the elderly to sit down and watch presidential announcements, Sister Constance Veit, Communications Director for the group, told IJReview.

“We decide to watch it online later or when we have time.” she said.
