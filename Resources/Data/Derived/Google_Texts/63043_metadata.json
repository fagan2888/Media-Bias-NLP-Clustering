Nick Crafts documents this at greater length, and adds a provocative analysis of debt dynamics.\n\nFirst, his chart:\n\nPhoto\n\nHe also notes that while many European countries had lower debt ratios in the 30s than they do today, the UK actually had a substantially higher ratio \u2014 and even more so after World War II. How did it deal with this debt? Not through the recipe currently being imposed in Europe, of fiscal austerity and internal devaluation. Instead, the UK relied on a cheap-money policy that produced low interest rates and moderate inflation \u2014 \u201cfinancial repression\u201d \u2014 with the central bank \u201csubservient\u201d not just to the government, but to government debt-management policies.\n\nIn an earlier paper Crafts argued, in effect, that high government debt levels may even have been a sort of advantage, in that they made it possible to credibly commit to inflationary policies. More than a decade ago Gauti Eggertsson made a similar argument for Japan in the 1930s.\n\nSo how does the current position of Europe fit into all this? Not well. The central bank isn\u2019t subservient, least of all to debt-management concerns, and the ideology of austerity rules. The result is a continuing slump \u2014 despite occasional quarters of growth \u2014 and a very bleak outlook.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131215085010, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "December 15, 2013", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/If Only It Were the 1930s ( 20131215 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "Europe does worse.", "title": "If Only It Were the 1930s", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/if-only-it-were-the-1930s/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "Europe does worse.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "December 15, 2013", "article": {"published_time": 1387115410, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2013-12-15T13:50:10-05:00"}, "utime": 20131215135010, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20131215, "pdate": 20131215, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "Europe does worse.", "title": "If Only It Were the 1930s", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/if-only-it-were-the-1930s/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/if-only-it-were-the-1930s/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "If Only It Were the 1930s", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8d00\"", "article_summary": "More than a decade ago Gauti Eggertsson made a similar argument for Japan in the 1930s.\nThe central bank isn\u2019t subservient, least of all to debt-management concerns, and the ideology of austerity rules.\nI\u2019ve mentioned before that at this point Europe is actually doing worse in the aftermath of the 2007 crisis than it did in the Great Depression.\nNick Crafts documents this at greater length, and adds a provocative analysis of debt dynamics.\nInstead, the UK relied on a cheap-money policy that produced low interest rates and moderate inflation \u2014 \u201cfinancial repression\u201d \u2014 with the central bank \u201csubservient\u201d not just to the government, but to government debt-management policies."}
