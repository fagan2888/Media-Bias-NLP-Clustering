That\u2019s in line with the roughly 30 percent figures seen in recent years, but still among the highest readings in the 14-year history of Gallup asking the question.\n\n\u201cLast year, many hoped that the opening of the government health care exchanges and the resulting increase in the number of Americans with health insurance would enable more people to seek medical treatment,\u201d the pollsters said. \u201cBut, despite a drop in the uninsured rate, a slightly higher percentage of Americans than in previous years report having put off medical treatment, suggesting that the Affordable Care Act has not immediately affected this measure.\u201d\n\nThe increase in delayed treatment because it\u2019s seen as too expensive could reflect high deductibles or copays that are part of the newly insured\u2019s plans, although separate research has shown that most of the newly insured in 2014 are satisfied with their health plans coverage, said Gallup.\n\n\u201cVariation in the pricing for medical treatments, not to mention differences in how much insurance plans cover, could be confusing Americans or making them fear a needed treatment is too expensive. And while the costs of medical procedures aren\u2019t rising as rapidly as they once were, it is still too early to tell if that is an effect of the Affordable Care Act and how prices may change in the future,\u201d said the pollsters.\n\nUninsured Americans are still the most likely to have delayed medical treatment because of cost, with 57 percent saying they put off treatment, compared with 34 percent with private insurance and 22 percent with Medicare or Medicaid.\n\nBut the number of Americans with private health plans who put off medical treatment because of cost jumped from 25 percent in 2013 to 34 percent in 2014, according to the poll.\n\nMore upper-income Americans also delayed treatment this year, up to 28 percent from 17 percent last year, showed the poll.\n\nHowever, the percentage of lower-income Americans \u2014 those with annual household incomes under $30,000 \u2014 who put off treatment in the past 12 months dropped from 43 percent in 2013 to 35 percent in 2014.\n\nThe percentage of middle-income Americans who have put off medical treatment remains roughly the same as last year, at 38 percent.\n\nAsked to rate the seriousness of their medical condition of illness, 22 percent of Americans who delayed treatment due to cost said they had \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat serious\u201d conditions.\n\n\u201cThis is double the 11% who say they have put off treatment for a non-serious condition. Furthermore, the percentage who have put off treatment for a serious condition has increased slightly since 2013,\u201d Gallup said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite a drop in number of uninsured Americans under Obamacare, more put off medical treatment this year because they can't afford it, said a new poll released Friday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Despite a drop in number of uninsured Americans under Obamacare, more put off medical treatment this year because they can\u2019t afford it, said a new poll released Friday.", "title": "Obamacare hasn\u2019t stopped more Americans from avoiding medical treatment because of high costs: poll", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/28/obamacare-hasnt-stopped-more-americans-from-avoidi/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/20/health-overhauljpeg-04948.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/20/health-overhauljpeg-04948.jpg", "description": "Despite a drop in number of uninsured Americans under Obamacare, more put off medical treatment this year because they can't afford it, said a new poll released Friday.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare hasn\u2019t stopped more Americans from avoiding medical tr"}, "Author": "S.A.
