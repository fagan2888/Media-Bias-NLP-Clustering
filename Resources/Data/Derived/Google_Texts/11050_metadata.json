In fact, they\u2019re getting bigger.\n\nSomething\u2019s coming. Something big. And it can\u2019t be good.\n\nGeorge isn\u2019t alone. All but a handful of his NCAA Division I cohorts are having similar Jurassic Park moments. Those who aren\u2019t \u2026 well, they\u2019re just not paying attention.\n\nThe threat, however, is no bipedal carnivore. It\u2019s a growing movement to mandate that big-time college football and men\u2019s basketball programs pay hefty salaries to scholarship players. Should this come to pass, CU will find itself on the bottom floor of a two-tiered caste system with no means of improving its lot.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with a top football player receiving an extra $50,000 a year?\u201d asked Pulitzer Prize-winning author Taylor Branch at a panel discussion at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. \u201cOr a top basketball player receiving an extra $200,000?\u201d\n\nBranch has been a central figure and movement crusader since publishing his essay, \u201cThe Shame of College Sports,\u201d in The Atlantic in 2011. But more on that later.\n\nUsing figures compiled on 225 public universities by USA Today, only 22 athletic departments generate enough revenue to cover their expenditures without extra help. CU is not among them. Of these, only 14 could afford to pay the kind of extra money Branch suggests, roughly $7 million per year.\n\nGiven that students are already swamped with debt and facing 8 percent tuition inflation, it would be unconscionable to force them to pony up the difference. That leaves two options: additional state subsidies or bigger athletic booster contributions. Otherwise, CU would have no choice but to accept its lot and settle in among the other untouchables.\n\nAs it currently stands, CU can (and does) find ways to woo top talent. But give one class of competitor the ability to sweeten the pie with monthly paychecks and no recruit will don a Buffalo jersey until he\u2019s exhausted all options to play-for-pay. The chasm between paying and non-paying schools will be deep, wide and impossible to cross. Any aspiration of building a program and competing at the highest levels will be a relic of the past.\n\nNotwithstanding the impact on CU athletics, there is a bigger question: Is professionalization the right thing to do? After all, New York Times columnist Joe Nocera and other media figures have likened the current system to plantation era slavery.\n\nSlavery? Perhaps they haven\u2019t seen the lavish facilities created for athletes who play for the big-time programs; they\u2019re not exactly slave quarters. And last I checked, college athletes \u2014 black, white and otherwise \u2014 are free to pack their bags and call it quits anytime they choose. That wasn\u2019t an option back on the plantation.\n\nBottom line, the provocative reference is shamelessly absurd, and while it may unnerve some would-be dissenters, it should offend the senses of every African-American who hears it.\n\nIronically, professionalizing the big-time programs could actually result in fewer scholarship opportunities for minority players. There\u2019s no denying that administrations are routinely asked to lower academic standards in order to admit desired recruits. Make no mistake, this draws the ire of administrators, professors and more than a few alumni and students. But whatever you think of the practice, it\u2019s given many athletes entrance into institutions they could never otherwise have attended.\n\nIn a two-caste system, this practice will likely come under greater scrutiny and criticism at non-paying schools. With fewer television dollars at stake for motivation, it could well come to a screeching halt.\n\nMeanwhile, among paying programs, academic expectations will diminish \u2014 if not disappear \u2014 as athletes morph into full-time W-2 employees and part-time students. \u201cOnce players become university employees,\u201d argues Richard Southall, director of the College Sport Research Institute, \u201cthey shouldn\u2019t even be required to be students.\u201d\n\nAll this raises an important question: How will fans respond? They\u2019re the wildcard. No one can say for sure whether fans will derive the same satisfaction following an NFL-lite team with little more than a licensing relationship with the university. If not, we\u2019ll have killed the goose that laid the golden egg \u2014 in which case, everyone loses.\n\nFor those who think this could never happen, think again. The movement has numerous high-profile supporters with substantial followings, and they\u2019re having an impact. The cover story in the Sept. 26 Time magazine (\u201cIt\u2019s Time to Pay College Athletes\u201d) confirms it.\n\nMovement crusaders like Branch, Nocera and even famed sportscaster Frank Deford frequently claim that professionalization will solve all manner of ills, from sports agent indiscretions to NCAA overreaching. Which brings me back to our panel discussion in Chapel Hill.\n\nIf I didn\u2019t know better, I would have sworn Branch was channeling Keyrock, the silver-tongued \u201cUnfrozen Caveman Lawyer\u201d from \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d who bamboozled his juries into paying big sums.\n\n\u201cYour lucrative television deals, complicated NCAA rules, and arbitrary procedures frighten and confuse me,\u201d I could almost hear him say before delivering his signature close. \u201cBut there\u2019s one thing I do know: These big time college athletes deserve big-time money.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s too much at stake here to be bamboozled. Even so, with the Time cover piece, the movement took a giant leap forward, and the ripples in George\u2019s coffee just got bigger.\n\nSomething\u2019s coming, something big, and there\u2019s nothing good about it.\n\nDavid B.
