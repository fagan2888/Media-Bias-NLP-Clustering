Actor Jean-Claude Van Damme made headlines a few weeks ago with his "Epic Split" advertisement for Volvo. The advertisement was immediately hailed and has over 57 million views on YouTube.

So naturally, people began to parody the ad. One of the parodies was congressional candidate Mike Collins, a Republican running for Georgia's 10th District. In his version of the ad, Collins discusses the "ups and downs" of starting a trucking business and his aversion to Obamacare.

Take a look here:

While Collins isn't nearly as limber as Van Damme, I'll give him kudos for an inventive way to raise awareness of the horrors Obmacare will wreak on small businesses.
