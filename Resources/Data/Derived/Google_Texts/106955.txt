A Jeep Cherokee ran into the side of the Lewiston Apartments at 51st and Lewis Monday afternoon.

The driver wasn't in the SUV - he had parked outside Fikes Shopping Center across the street. Somehow the SUV rolled down the embankment into the parking lot.

No one was hurt. There was damage to fencing, the building and the Jeep Cherokee.
