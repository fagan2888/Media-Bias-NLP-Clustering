(The final numbers come out in March)\n\nThe state\u2019s job growth outpaced the rest of the country for the third straight year, though it slowed slightly towards the end of the year.\n\nCalifornia added jobs at a 2.2 percent annual rate last year, outpacing the nation\u2019s 1.8 percent rate.\n\nLos Angeles County fared the worst as far as seasonally adjusted year-to-year job gains among California's major metropolitan areas, according to The Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp.:\n\nSan Jose/Silicon Valley +4 percent\n\nSan Francisco Bay Area + 3.8 percent\n\nSan Diego +3.3 percent\n\nInland Empire +1.9 percent\n\nOrange County +2.3 percent\n\nVentura +2 percent\n\nLos Angeles +1.7 percent\n\nLos Angeles County's unemployment rate is 7.9 percent, down from 9.2 percent a year ago, and once again it was health care that added the most jobs: 22,000.\n\n\"Part of it is demographic, and part of it was the Affordable Care Act, which is helping more individuals take advantage of health care,\" said Robert Kleinhenz, Chief Economist at the L.A. County Economic Development Corp.\n\nAside from an aging population needing more health care, Kleinhenz adds that more people can afford to get medical treatment because of the improvement in the economy.\n\nWith more money in their pockets, more people have also been traveling, which made leisure and hospitality the second-best area for job growth in the county, with 11,300 new jobs.\n\nWhat's not doing well?\n\nManufacturing, especially in non-durable goods \u2013 which includes food and clothing \u2013 lost the most jobs in L.A. County in 2014: 6,700 jobs. The only other sector that shed jobs was the government, which lost almost 3,800 jobs positions last year.\n\nKleinhenz also pointed to wholesale trade, which lost 300 jobs year-to-year in but saw job growth in the Inland Empire.\n\n\"Some parts of the goods movement may be moving into the Inland Empire, where we have seen in recent years quite a bit of warehouse building taking place,\u201d said Kleinhenz.", "article_metadata": {"author": "Southern California Public Radio", "og": {"site_name": "Southern California Public Radio", "description": "Los Angeles fared the worst as far as seasonally adjusted year-to-year job gains among California's major metropolitan areas.", "title": "Want a job in LA?
