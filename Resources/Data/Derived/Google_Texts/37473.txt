Despite the efforts of the bell ringers perched outside of area stores, donations to the Salvation Army's Red Kettles are down in Milwaukee County when compared with last year.

The charity has collected $65,000 less than it had last year at this time, according to a news release. The organization is trying to raise $3.8 million to fund more than 80 programs and services in the area. The Salvation Army has raised nearly $1.8 million so far, according to its website.

The charity notes people can donate $10 by texting "sarmy" to "71777" on their cell phone or by visiting their website.
