Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) and potential challengers Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.). Compared with her rivals, Clinton does not have a coherent message for her purpose in politics, they said.\n\n\u201cWhy is she running for president? This goes back to the question in 1980. Why do you want to be president?\u201d Scarborough asked. The MSNBC anchor also asked \u201cWhat does she stand for? What does she believe?\u201d\n\nJohn Heilemann mocked the Clinton campaign\u2019s authenticity reset as part of the problem. The new strategy to make the candidate more spontaneous has been lambasted by pundits and the public alike. Scarborough noted her apology felt insincere because it was forced and focus group driven.\n\n\u201cNo one has any doubt about who Bernie Sanders is. \u201cI know who that guy is. This guy is who he is. If you watched Joe Biden last week on Colbert, people look at that and say I know that guy, that\u2019s the real deal,\u201d Heilemann said. \u201cAt the same time, you got stories in the paper about how Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign has decided they need to project authenticity and learned that by talking to focus groups.\u201d\n\nScarborough placed the responsibility of the flailing campaign squarely on Clinton\u2019s shoulders.\n\n\u201cShe has the same mistake in \u201916 that she had in \u201908,\u201d Scarborough said. \u201cShe\u2019s the one allowing herself to be over managed. She\u2019s the one that is surrounding herself with a small group of yes men. She\u2019s the one that brought in John [Podesta] and other people to make sure it wasn\u2019t like 2008. She\u2019s the one who is still conducting it like it was 2008.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Despite her decades in the public eye, Hillary Clinton continues to struggle explaining her rationale for running for president, leading the former Democratic frontrunner to appear inauthentic, MSNBC'", "title": "Morning Joe Panel: \u2018Crazy\u2019 That Clinton Has Never Had A Message Or Rationale For Running", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/politics/morning-joe-panel-crazy-that-clinton-has-never-had-a-message-or-rationale-for-running/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/freebeacon.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Despite her decades in the public eye, Hillary Clinton continues to struggle explaining her rational", "creator": "@bassalid", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/freebeacon.png", "title": "Morning Joe Panel: \u2018Crazy\u2019 That Clinton Has Never Had A Message Or Rationale For Running", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Compared with her rivals, Clinton does not have a coherent message for her purpose in politics, they said.\nBY: Follow @bassalidDespite her decades in the public eye, Hillary Clinton continues to struggle explaining her rationale for running for president, leading the former Democratic frontrunner to appear inauthentic, MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe panel said Monday.\nWhy do you want to be president?\u201d Scarborough asked.\n\u201cYou started out by saying the clarity of her message is still sort of lacking, she\u2019s never had one,\u201d Brzezinski said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been asking this question for a year.\u201dThe panel compared Clinton\u2019s genuineness with fellow candidate Sen.
