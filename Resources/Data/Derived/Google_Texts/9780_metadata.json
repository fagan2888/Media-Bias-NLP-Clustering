They fall off curbs and bridges into wet cement and creek beds. They are distracted walkers who, while calling or texting on mobile phones, have suffered cuts and bruises, sustained serious head injuries or even been killed.\n\nAs many cities and states promote walkable neighborhoods, in part to attract more young people, some also are levying fines on distracted walkers and lowering speed limits to make streets gentler for the inattentive.\n\nRelated: The Silent Society - How Americans Have Replaced Words with Clicks\n\nPedestrian injuries due to cell phone use are up 35 percent since 2010, according to federal emergency room data reviewed by Stateline, and some researchers blame at least 10 percent of the 78,000 pedestrian injuries in the U.S. in 2012 on mobile device distraction. The federal Fatality Analysis Reporting system attributes about a half-dozen pedestrians deaths a year to \u201cportable electronic devices,\u201d including phones and music players.\n\nTo reduce the number of injuries and deaths associated with distracted walking, Utah and New Jersey have experimented with fines for texting in dangerous walking situations. And New York state has lowered speed limits in New York City, in part to make traffic less dangerous for distracted walkers.\n\n\u201cThe policy issue is that we have to design streets for the way people actually behave, and behavior is changing,\u201d said Noah Budnick, chief policy officer for Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group based in New York City. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking at a phone when you\u2019re walking around, that shouldn\u2019t mean death. So we have to design forgiving streets.\u201d\n\nRelated: 6 Roadblocks to Worker Productivity\n\nNew York state had to approve lower speed limits for the city, including a new speed limit of 20 mph in Central Park, and a 25-mph speed limit in the rest of the city unless otherwise posted. The city has also been blocking off more streets to make safer pedestrian plazas. A woman in Queens was killed by a bus in 2012 while talking on a phone as she ran across an intersection in downtown Flushing, an area targeted for pedestrian improvements.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx, who has acknowledged that distracted walking is a factor in increased pedestrian deaths and injuries, this year awarded grants totaling $1.6 million to Louisville, New York City and Philadelphia for safety programs. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to encourage people to have an awareness that this problem is a real problem,\u201d Foxx said last year.\n\nFines and Awareness\n\nPedestrian injuries reached 78,000 in 2012, the highest number since 2001, according to the National Highway Traffic Administration. The number of pedestrian deaths, about 4,700 in 2012, has been increasing since 2009, after falling for several years before that.\n\nRelated: 10 Unbelievably Stupid Street Signs\n\nSome jurisdictions are targeting distracted walking. In Utah, the state transit authority approved a $50 fine for distracted walking near commuter rail. Fort Lee, New Jersey, used existing jaywalking laws to crack down on people using phones while walking into traffic.\n\nPhiladelphia tried to publicize the dangers in 2012 by jokingly marking off sidewalk \u201ce-lanes\u201d reserved for texting walkers on April Fools\u2019 Day. \u201cWe know that many, many people are using the sidewalks, looking at their iPhones, Blackberrys, other electronic devices and they\u2019re quite distracted by those devices, bumping into people,\u201d deadpanned Mayor Michael Nutter in a video, as a distracted walker knocked his microphone away.\n\nBut many pedestrians interviewed by the city seemed to like the idea and took it seriously. \u201cAs a user, it\u2019ll keep most of those Bozos out of my way,\u201d one onlooker said. \u201cI\u2019m a severe texter and walker, so I don\u2019t know if I can quit on my own,\u201d another said.\n\nMinnesota, Utah, North Carolina, South Carolina and Washington state have also included pedestrian safety in programs which, like New York City\u2019s, aim to make all traffic deaths a thing of the past. Some of the money comes for these programs from federal sources, like the $25 million in transportation funds for New York City that will, among other things, widen sidewalks near subway stations in Harlem.\n\nRelated: Some Hands-Free Technology Raises Your Risk\n\nSan Francisco is pledging $50 million in local, state and federal funds for its similar Walk First program. The city will scrutinize \u201chigh injury corridors\u201d and proposed improvements such as pedestrian refuge islands and raised crosswalks. The program acknowledges the problem of distracted walkers: \u201cWhether (or not) they are using mobile devices\u2026the City\u2019s goal is to improve safety for all types of road users.\u201d\n\nAccident Causes\n\nThe combination of distracted walking and distracted driving is commonly blamed for the recent increase in pedestrian deaths, according to the Governors Highway Safety Association, which asked states to comment for a recent report. \u201cMany states agree this is an important issue, although supportive data other than occasional anecdotes are sparse,\u201d the report concluded. Some states differed on the causes \u2013 California cited shifting demographics, bringing in new people unfamiliar with traffic patterns, and Nebraska cited warm weather bringing out more pedestrians.\n\nGeorgia discounted the risk of distracted walking. \u201cCompared to speeding, red-light running, illegal turns, and distance between safe crossing facilities, distracted walking is just a minor contributor to risk of pedestrian deaths,\u201d the state told researchers.\n\nHalf of pedestrians admit to talking on the phone while walking across the street, and a quarter say they text or email while crossing the street, even though most realize it\u2019s dangerous, according to a survey last year by Liberty Mutual Insurance.\n\nRelated: Why Younger Americans Are Ditching Cars\n\n\u201cSo much attention has been paid, and rightly so, to distracted driving that we have ignored the fact that distracted walking and crossing can be just as risky,\u201d said David Melton, a driving safety expert with Liberty Mutual.\n\nEmergency Room Visits\n\nEmergency room visit data analyzed by Stateline are published by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and incidents caused by distracted walking are likely to be underreported, since the injured party would have to confess to texting or phoning while walking.\n\nJack Nasar, a researcher at Ohio State University, studied the emergency room data and found a six-fold increase in distracted walking injuries between 2005 and 2010. He said the real number could be thousands of times the 1,506 visits he found in 2013.\n\n\u201cI think it is safe to say that the numbers we have are much lower than what is really happening,\u201d Nasar said in a release about his study. Restricting the search for incidents to streets and public places, Stateline found 813 in 2010 and 1,105 last year.\n\nRelated: How Congress Is \u2018Killing Our Transportation System\u2019\n\nSince his study was published last year, Nasar told Stateline, he\u2019s seen warning signs at crossing points and public-service signs advising against texting and walking. \u201cIn a nutshell, it appears that some places are using low-cost efforts for pedestrian safety,\u201d Nasar said.\n\nAnother researcher at the University of Buffalo, Dr. Dietrich Jehle, estimated that one in 10 pedestrian injuries is now related to distracted walking, and that it causes more accidents than distracted driving, even if the severity of injuries is lower.\n\nJehle, who based his estimate on his own experience as an emergency room physician, said texting is the most dangerous thing to do on foot \u2013 more dangerous than listening to music or talking on the phone. A Stony Brook University study in 2011 documented the effect of texting on navigation while walking, finding it significantly more dangerous than talking on a cell phone, leading to a rate of 61 percent navigation errors in simulated situations. \u201cWhile talking on the phone is a distraction, texting is much more dangerous because you can\u2019t see the path in front of you,\u201d Jehle said.\n\nThis article originally appeared in Stateline, a nonpartisan, nonprofit news service of the Pew Center on the States that provides daily reporting and analysis on trends in state policy.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "They walk in front of cars, and into tree limbs and street signs.", "title": "The High Costs of Distracted Walking", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/12/11/Financial-Consequences-Distracted-Walking", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RTR44IFA.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/12/11/Financial-Consequences-Distracted-Walking", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RTR44IFA.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "They walk in front of cars, and into tree limbs and street signs.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde97c\"", "article_summary": "To reduce the number of injuries and deaths associated with distracted walking, Utah and New Jersey have experimented with fines for texting in dangerous walking situations.\nRelated: 10 Unbelievably Stupid Street SignsSome jurisdictions are targeting distracted walking.\nAnd New York state has lowered speed limits in New York City, in part to make traffic less dangerous for distracted walkers.\nIn Utah, the state transit authority approved a $50 fine for distracted walking near commuter rail.\nJack Nasar, a researcher at Ohio State University, studied the emergency room data and found a six-fold increase in distracted walking injuries between 2005 and 2010."}
