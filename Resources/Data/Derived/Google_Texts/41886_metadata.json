Don\u2019t believe me? Look at a recent Reason-Rupe poll of millennial voters.\n\nNow if you\u2019re a Republican and you\u2019re feeling nervous, let me reassure you that the poll has a lot of good news. For instance, it shows that 57 percent of millennials won\u2019t back larger government if it means their tax bills go up, 78 percent think that debt and deficit spending are major problems, and a majority want access to private retirement accounts, even if it means a few grannies have to take a tumble off a cliff.\n\nNo, seriously. When asked to respond to the question, \u201cWould you favor or oppose allowing younger workers to invest their Social Security taxes in private retirement accounts if doing so required reducing Social Security benefits to current and future seniors,\u201d 51 percent of millennials still said yes, five points more than said no. And when the seniors are left out? Nearly three quarters favor the idea.\n\nBut if you think these conservative tendencies alone are going to be enough to make Republicans competitive with this generation, well, as South Park says, you\u2019re gonna have a bad time. And if you\u2019re a social conservative, whether of the Jerry Falwell variety or of the \u201cFaith and Family Left\u201d variety, then sorry Santorum voters, but you\u2019re not in Iowa anymore. Fully 61 percent of young voters favor keeping online porn legal and 57 percent favor making it legal to use marijuana. Slouching towards Gomorrah with our shirts untucked, the lot of us.\n\nAnd that thing people keep saying about how Republicans can\u2019t win young people if they\u2019re anti-gay? It\u2019s worse than you think. Not only do seven in ten millennials favor legalizing gay marriage, including 54 percent of all Republican millennials, but fully one third of those Republican millennials actually trust Democrats more than Republicans when it comes to gay issues. That\u2019s right, even when you think you\u2019re preaching to the College Republican choir, one third of the choir is shifting uneasily in their seats wondering if Grandpa went off his meds again.\n\n\u201cBut wait!\u201d cry social conservatives. \u201cSure, young people might be druggie gay-loving perverts, but they\u2019re pro-life, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Well, according to the poll, 61 percent favor keeping abortion at least somewhat legal. Being 20 points behind on an issue isn\u2019t winning. Even Brazil was only down 6 against Germany.\n\nSo yeah, social issues have to go, but that\u2019s not all. You\u2019ve got to do more than keep talking about how capitalism will save the young if they just give it time. This generation wants to see results. Literally. When it comes to government spending, they don\u2019t care how they get jobs, so long as something works. If it\u2019s infrastructure spending, fine. If it\u2019s job training programs, cool. And if it\u2019s tax cuts? Well, six in ten of them are fine with those, but they have to actually create job growth. This generation is fed up with waiting for economic opportunity. They want it now, and they don\u2019t care how they get it. If you want to win with them, you need a jobs program that comports with your principles, but that also will work, and you need it yesterday. And if you want to sell them on limited government, here\u2019s a tip: Offer concrete proposals for limiting it. Millennials love them, and they uniformly poll better than empty calls to shrink it.\n\nNow, I know what a lot of you are thinking \u2014 this is a lot to give up. Well, you\u2019re right. It is. But here\u2019s what you get if you do it right: An anti-Obamacare, anti-spending, pro-business, pro-entrepreneurial and meritocratic generation that\u2019s bigger than the Baby Boom generation and whose hearts are already on your side where the economy is concerned, even if their heads need to see the details.\n\nStart with Obamacare. A slim majority of millennials approve of the idea of it. But slightly more than half, 55 percent, also oppose redistributive health care policies that raise costs in order to help the uninsured. But among those who pay for their own insurance? Nearly six in ten oppose this idea. Good luck selling Obamacare, which is fundamentally a redistributive program from the young and insured to the old and uninsured, to a group that hostile. And hey, you know what makes people able to pay for their own insurance? A job.\n\nAs for government spending, the vast majority of millennials agree that it\u2019s a problem; they just aren\u2019t sure if it needs to be solved right now. About a third want to wait for the economy to improve to cut spending. This means that functionally, 82 percent of millennials would be willing to do something about spending if they felt economically secure. And hey, you know what makes people feel economically secure? A job.\n\nNow, I\u2019m going to tell you something a little scary: 54 percent of millennials want the government to guarantee a college degree. That\u2019s right. 54 percent. But you know why they favor that kind of expansive government spending? Because most of them are poor. As their income rises, this generation tends to get a lot less compassionate awfully fast. In fact, their support for socialism and government intervention starts dropping off the instant they graduate college.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Mytheos Holt", "description": "'Millennials aren\u2019t hardline liberals, they\u2019re just desperate, and they\u2019ll vote for whoever looks serious about helping them.'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Memo to Republicans: If you want to build a lasting coalition, spend less time picking fights over gays holding hands, and more time getting the largest generation out of their parents\u2019 basements.
