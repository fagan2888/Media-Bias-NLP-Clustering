Something positive happened Saturday despite another loss, this time a 3-2 extra-inning defeat to the Pirates.\n\nColorado starter, lefty Brett Anderson, finally gave the Rockies something they haven\u2019t seen since May.\n\n(OK, by virtue of his even being back on the mound after missing 81 games with a broken finger suffered in April, Anderson gave the Rockies something again when he returned last week).\n\nAnderson\u2019s seven stellar innings Saturday, one day after Jorge De La Rosa\u2019s six strong innings, gave the Rockies the kind of one-two pitching combo they\u2019ve lacked for most of the season. Since May 7, the Rockies have back-to-back wins from a starting pitcher just once \u2014 when Tyler Matzek and Jhoulys Chacin did it against Atlanta on June 11-12.\n\nThe Rockies got consecutive wins from a starting pitcher just six times this season (including a three-game stretch in May).\n\nColorado lost twice the past two nights, but certainly not on the arms of Anderson and De La Rosa.\n\n\u201cAs far as executing pitches, it was the best I felt in awhile,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nHe threw 110 pitches over seven innings against Pittsburgh. He gave up just four hits and one run. And he struck out eight with just one walk.\n\n\u201cTruthfully, my stuff wasn\u2019t too much better (than his last start),\u201d Anderson said. \u201cI just executed pitches better and was more efficient. I think I threw more pitches tonight than I have in two-plus years. But I feel like I battled well and gave us a chance.\u201d\n\nRockies manager Walt Weiss pegged Anderson\u2019s effectiveness to a breaking ball that got better as the night got longer.\n\n\u201cHis breaking ball was real good,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a great breaking ball and used it well tonight. I think he went to it especially late, when maybe he was getting a little fatigued. Like I say, his second start after being away a long time \u2014 and he got some swings and misses.\u201d\n\nAnderson agreed, saying it was a slider that kept him in the game, even after he got to triple-digit pitches.\n\n\u201cThe last inning I was gonna live or die on the slider,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cI threw six or seven to (Pedro) Alvarez and three or four to (Jordy) Mercer and three or four to the last guy (Ike Davis, all in the seventh).\n\n\u201cI was going hitter by hitter. If I was gonna get beat, I was gonna get beat on my best pitch. Fortunately, it worked out for me.\u201d\n\nAnderson, too, was helped by a Rockies lead, even after pitching from behind for most of the game. After Carlos Gonzalez hit a two-run homer in the seventh, Anderson responded.\n\n\u201cI was determined to go out there and throw a shutdown inning after a big home run,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nAfter that, it was up to the Rockies bullpen. We\u2019ve talked about them already.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Brett Anderson,bullpen,Carlos Gonzalez,Jhoulys Chacin,Jorge De La Rosa,pitching,Tyler Matzek", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Colorado lefty starter Brett Anderson finally gave the Rockies something they haven't seen since May.", "title": "Brett Anderson in pitching form and Rockies have a 1-2 punch", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2014/07/19/brett-anderson-quickly-finally-pitching-form-rockies-1-2-punch/18234/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2014/07/brett-anderson.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Colorado lefty starter Brett Anderson finally gave the Rockies something they haven't seen since May.", "creator": "@nickgroke", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2014/07/19/brett-anderson-quickly-finally-pitching-form-rockies-1-2-punch/18234/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2014/07/brett-anderson.jpg", "title": "Brett Anderson quickly found his pitching form \u2014 and now the Rockies have a 1-2 punch", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Colorado lefty starter Brett Anderson finally gave the Rockies something they haven't seen since May."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd12eb\"", "article_summary": "Colorado starter, lefty Brett Anderson, finally gave the Rockies something they haven\u2019t seen since May.\nAnderson\u2019s seven stellar innings Saturday, one day after Jorge De La Rosa\u2019s six strong innings, gave the Rockies the kind of one-two pitching combo they\u2019ve lacked for most of the season.\n(OK, by virtue of his even being back on the mound after missing 81 games with a broken finger suffered in April, Anderson gave the Rockies something again when he returned last week).\n\u201cI just executed pitches better and was more efficient.\nHe threw 110 pitches over seven innings against Pittsburgh."}
