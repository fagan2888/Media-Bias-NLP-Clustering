Authorities said that was carried out by separatist militants from the western region of Xinjiang.\n\nCiting a spokesman from the Harbin railway police authority, Xinhua said on Saturday that a middle-aged man forcibly prevented passengers passing through the security gate at Qing'an Railway Station in Suihua City at midday.\n\nWhen a patrolling policeman tried to stop him, the man picked up a child and threw him at the police, Xinhua said. The man also tried to grab the policeman's gun and club, and the police opened fire to keep passengers safe, it added.\n\nNo passengers were injured and the suspect, whose identity has not been confirmed, died in the incident, the spokesman said. He said police were still investigating the case.\n\nViolent crime is rare in China compared with many other countries, but there have been a series of knife attacks in recent years, many on school children.\n\nIn March this year, knife-wielding attackers slashed and stabbed people at a railway station in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, wounding at least nine before police shot dead one of the suspected assailants and arrested another.\n\n(Reporting by Brenda Goh;
