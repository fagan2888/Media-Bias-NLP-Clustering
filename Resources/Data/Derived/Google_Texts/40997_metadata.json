(Photo: John T. Greilick / The Detroit News)Buy Photo\n\nTokyo \u2014 Toyota Motor Corp. signed on as a worldwide Olympic sponsor Friday in a landmark deal reportedly worth nearly $1 billion, becoming the first car company to join the IOC\u2019s top-tier marketing program.\n\nThe eight-year deal starts globally in 2017 and runs through the 2024 Olympics. It will cover three consecutive Olympics in Asia, including the 2020 Games in Tokyo.\n\nToyota becomes the first auto manufacturer ever signed up by the International Olympic Committee for its global TOP sponsorship program. It joins as a sponsor in the \u201cmobility category.\u201d\n\nTerms of the deal were not announced, but Japanese media reported Toyota will pay $835 million.\n\nThat would be a record for any IOC sponsorship deal \u2014 by far. Four-year TOP deals are usually worth about $100 million and eight-year agreements $200 million.\n\nIOC President Thomas Bach was in Tokyo to sign the agreement with Toyota president Akio Toyoda.\n\n\u201cThis is a very symbolic day,\u201d Bach said. \u201cIt is the first time in the successful history of the TOP program that we have had a mobility category.\u201d\n\nToyota, the world\u2019s largest automaker, becomes the third Japanese company to become a worldwide Olympic sponsor after Panasonic and Bridgestone. Toyota also becomes the 12th TOP sponsor overall and third committed through 2024. Other TOP sponsors include Coca-Cola and McDonald\u2019s.\n\nThe Toyota deal covers the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, and the 2022 Winter Games and 2024 Summer Olympics. The host cities for the 2022 and 2024 games have not yet been selected.\n\nTwo Asian candidates \u2014 Beijing and Almaty, Kazakhstan \u2014 are bidding for the 2022 Games, with the IOC vote to be held on July 31.\n\nWhile Toyota will join the TOP program in 2017, it will have marketing rights in Japan with immediate effect.\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning of 2017, Toyota is our exclusive worldwide partner for the mobility category,\u201d Bach said. \u201cAnd exclusivity means no other partner can join the program and can support the national Olympic committees.\u201d\n\nThe deal locks Korean car giant Hyundai out of the 2018 Pyeongchang Games on its home turf. If Boston wins the right to host the 2024 Olympics, the U.S. car industry would also be shut out.\n\nThe IOC said Toyota will work with organizing committees to \u201cprovide sustainable mobility solution for the games to help with safer, more efficient mobility, including intelligent transport systems, urban traffic systems and vehicle-to-vehicle communications systems.\u201d\n\nBach said the deal is in line with the Olympic Agenda 2020 reforms approved by the IOC in December.\n\n\u201cWe will do everything possible to fulfill our new role in The Olympic Partner Program and to justify the trust that the IOC has placed in us,\u201d Toyoda said. \u201cThe addition of the mobility category \u2026 is important recognition for our entire industry.\u201d\n\nThe head of the IOC\u2019s marketing commission is Tsunekazu Takeda, who is also president of the Japanese Olympic Committee and vice president of Tokyo\u2019s organizing committee.\n\n\u201cThis agreement is a powerful indication of the strength of the Olympic brand globally and the appeal of an association with the Olympic movement,\u201d Takeda said.\n\nToyota will showcase its products at the Tokyo Games, including the Toyota Mirai, a hydrogen-powered vehicle that is eco-friendly and in line with the Olympic theme of sustainability.\n\n\u201cMr. Toyoda does not wait to promote the Murai in Tokyo 2020,\u201d Bach said. \u201cHe already started this morning. I had an opportunity to drive the Mirai at the exhibition center and it was a great experience.\u201d\n\nOther TOP sponsors are General Electric, Atos, Dow, Omega, Samsung, VISA and Procter and Gamble.\n\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
