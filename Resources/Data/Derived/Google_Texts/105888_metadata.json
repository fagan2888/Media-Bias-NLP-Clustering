I told all of my female friends to consider the option, because it was just so easy; sure, the insertion hurt (okay, it sucked) and the cramping for days afterward wasn\u2019t fun either (it, um, also sucked), but the months of worry-free sex that followed made any pain worth it. Then my IUD fell out and I got pregnant, and I wasn\u2019t quite sure what to make of long-acting reversible contraception.\n\nBut now, like a growing number of young women across the country \u2014 I\u2019m back on the IUD train. I made an appointment to get a second copper IUD this afternoon, in fact, before I had to cancel it \u2014 because I got a call from my doctor\u2019s office alerting me to a problem with my insurance, adding that the insertion procedure would cost $1,300 without coverage.\n\nOf course, with insurance, IUDs and hormonal implants \u2014 which the Guttmacher Institute recently found to be the third most popular forms of birth control \u2014 are free, in accordance with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraceptive coverage mandate. And more and more women are taking advantage of the option, especially when its considered to be one of the most effective forms of birth control on the market. According to Guttmacher\u2019s findings, use of LARCs has risen steadily since 2002, with the rate growing from 2.4 percent that year to 8.5 percent in 2009.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Long-acting contraceptive decides are some of the most effective on the market.
