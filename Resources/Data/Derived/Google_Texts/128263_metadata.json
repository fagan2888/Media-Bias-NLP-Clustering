Hidden in the stolen money was a GPS tracking device that brought officers to the busy intersection but was unable to provide vehicle-by-vehicle location information.\n\nTo surround 19 cars stopped at a light and detain 28 occupants in those vehicles in an attempt to find a robbery suspect violated the motorists\u2019 Fourth Amendment protections against unlawful search and seizure and excessive force, Lane said.\n\n\u201c(Police) brandished ballistic shields and pointed assault rifles directly at innocent citizens, including children under 10 years old,\u201d the lawsuit reads. \u201cOfficers with police dogs were at the ready. No one was free to leave.\u201d\n\nOutgoing Police Chief Dan Oates said Saturday that U.S. District Judge William J. Martinez had already ruled that prosecutors could use evidence that officers gathered during the massive traffic stop, even though the judge acknowledged that \u201cinvasiveness\u201d was the \u201cmost troubling\u201d aspect of the officers\u2019 actions.\n\n\u201cMy officers took a very dangerous person off the street, and he\u2019s in jail today,\u201d Oates said. \u201cAnd nobody got hurt.\u201d\n\nThe chief, who will leave May 30 to head the Miami Beach, Fla., police force, said the court to date has held that his officers acted reasonably given the circumstances.\n\nOates and several Aurora police officers are also named in the suit.\n\nLane said if Aurora police want to use GPS technology to track suspects, they need to use a more accurate hand-held beacon that can home in on a transmitter to within a few feet.\n\n\u201cIf you want to use technology, make sure you know how to use it and plan for contingencies like this so that they won\u2019t involve detaining innocent people for hours and pointing high-powered automatic weapons at children,\u201d he said.\n\nLane said his clients are seeking unspecified monetary damages.\n\nJohn Aguilar: 303-954-1695, jaguilar@denverpost.com or twitter.com/abuvthefold", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Motorists sue Aurora, police in 2012 traffic stop after bank robbery", "title": "Motorists sue Aurora, police in 2012 traffic stop after bank robbery", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/05/17/motorists-sue-aurora-police-in-2012-traffic-stop-after-bank-robbery/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-17T15:28:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-17T15:28:42+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Motorists who were detained at an Aurora intersection nearly two years ago while officers attempted to locate and apprehend an on-the-run bank robber have sued the city for violating their Fourth Amendment right against unlawful search and seizure.\n\u201cThis was overreaching.\u201dHe said police should have used more precise location tracking technology to pinpoint the location of Christian Paetsch, the man eventually convicted and imprisoned in the robbery of a Wells Fargo branch June 2, 2012.\nOates and several Aurora police officers are also named in the suit.\nTo surround 19 cars stopped at a light and detain 28 occupants in those vehicles in an attempt to find a robbery suspect violated the motorists\u2019 Fourth Amendment protections against unlawful search and seizure and excessive force, Lane said.\nHidden in the stolen money was a GPS tracking device that brought officers to the busy intersection but was unable to provide vehicle-by-vehicle location information."}
