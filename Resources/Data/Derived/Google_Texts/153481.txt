Culinary Workers Local 226 and Bartenders Local 165 reached agreement over the weekend on new five-year contracts with the Riviera and the Treasure Island, the second and third independent casinos to settle with the unions.

The contract, which would replace an agreement that expired last June, still must be ratified by workers at the two Strip casinos.

Last week, the Culinary and Bartenders unions reached a new contract agreement with the Tropicana. Previously, the union settled new contracts with casinos owned by MGM Resorts International and Caesars Entertainment Corp.

The unions are continuing to negotiate with the LVH, Stratosphere, Plaza, Las Vegas Club, Binion’s, 4 Queens, The D, Fremont, Main Street Station, Golden Nugget, El Cortez, Golden Gate, Jerry’s Nugget and Brady Laundries.

The union has scheduled a strike authorization vote for the unsettled properties on March 20.

In a statement, the unions said the economic packages, agreed to by the Riviera and Treasure Island, mirror previous agreements with other gaming companies.

Workers will keep their health insurance and changes were negotiated for food and beverage operations to allow for flexibility in closed restaurants with the goal of reopening and allowing employees to gain back the jobs.

Culinary Secretary-Treasurer Geoconda Arguello-Kline called the agreement with Riviera “mutually beneficial” to the casino and the workers.
