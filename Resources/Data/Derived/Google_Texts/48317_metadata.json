So Barnes has a keen sense of the justices and the law.\n\nBecause the justices wait until the end of their term to hand down the most momentous blockbusters, June is the busiest month of the year for a SCOTUS reporter. On Tuesday afternoon, Barnes answered a few of our questions about what to expect in the newsy next few days.\n\nWhat are the most consequential Supreme Court decisions we\u2019re still awaiting?\n\nThe term will really be known for two cases: King v. Burwell, about whether subsidies for Obamacare will continue to be available to people in states that did not set up their own exchanges, and Obergefell v. Hodges, which asks if the Constitution requires states to offer marriage licenses to same-sex couples. But there is also a challenge to the EPA\u2019s plan to limit emissions of toxic pollutants from coal and oil-fired power plants (Michigan v. EPA); whether anti-discrimination protections in the Fair Housing Act extend to policies with a so-called disparate impact (Texas Dept. of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project); and a challenge to one of the drugs used in lethal injections (Glossip v. Gross).\n\nWashington Post Supreme Court reporter Bob Barnes\n\nThere is buzz around town that the justices will side with the government in King v. Burwell. What do you make of that?\n\nAnyone who feels confident predicting what\u2019s going on inside the Supreme Court as the justices write this opinion is probably wrong. The oral argument showed a divided court, and it will probably come down to Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court\u2019s most influential justices. I will say that Obamacare proponents have done an effective job of pointing out the real-life consequences of an adverse ruling. I was a little surprised President Obama weighed in again this week, saying the court probably should not have taken the case. But he is right that if the court rules against the government, the remedy is a one-sentence bill by Congress (although no one expects that to happen).\n\nAnthony Kennedy is widely seen as the swing vote on the gay marriage case. If SCOTUS recognizes a Constitutional right to same-sex marriage, what are the chances that the majority would be greater than 5-4? Who are the conservative justices most likely to join such a majority?\n\nIt would seem from the dissents conservatives wrote two years ago in the Proposition 8 and the federal Defense of Marriage Act cases that only Roberts could be in play. Although Roberts would have upheld DOMA, he made a point of noting that the court was not deciding whether state laws restricting marriage only to a man and a woman are unconstitutional. At oral argument, he raised an intriguing question about whether bans on same-sex marriage might violate protections against sex discrimination. He also seemed to be the only justice very interested in the second question in the case: whether states that do not offer same-sex marriage must recognize those unions performed in states that do.\n\nYour story on the Court\u2019s Jerusalem ruling led the paper Tuesday. Looking beyond the facts of the case, how big of a deal do you think this will be for executive power long-term?\n\nHard to know. It was a decisive victory for the executive branch, but pretty cautious in limiting the question to recognition of foreign nations and their boundaries. The majority opinion written by Kennedy seemed to make clear that the president takes the lead in foreign policy, but that there is plenty of room for Congress to act. Kennedy went out of his way to say the administration\u2019s position that the executive branch has \u201cexclusive authority to conduct diplomatic relations\u201d was asking for too much.\n\nWhat\u2019s been the biggest surprise for you so far this term?\n\nTwo things:\n\nThe interaction among the justices during the lethal injection oral arguments was as tendentious as I\u2019ve ever seen. There was such infighting that Roberts granted the advocates additional time to make their arguments without interruption. The court spends an outsized portion of its time on death penalty cases, and there is clearly some bad blood between the justices.\n\nThe other is that Roberts wrote the court\u2019s opinion (Williams-Yulee v. Florida Bar) upholding a Florida prohibition on judicial candidates personally asking for campaign contributions. Just about every question and comment he made during oral arguments pointed in the other direction. It is a good reminder that those sessions are not always predictive.\n\nIf you\u2019re not following Barnes on Twitter, you should.
