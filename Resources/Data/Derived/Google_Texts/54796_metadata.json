Here's a look at the projects just a few of them are pursuing. See the full list of honorees here.\n\nEd Pershing, the 2012 Health Care Hero: Lifetime Achievement, has been named an Outstanding Alumnus by the University of Tennessee Department of Accounting and Information Management. Pershing Yoakley & Associates, the firm he co-founded, is now the nation\u2019s 10th largest privately held health care consulting firm. PYA opened a Nashville office last year.\n\nDr. Lynn Massingale, executive chairman of TeamHealth, was named this year\u2019s EY Entrepreneur of the Year for the Southeast region in the services sector. The award recognizes entrepreneurs who demonstrate excellence and extraordinary success in innovation, financial performance and personal commitment to their businesses and communities.\n\nTeamHealth, which Massingale co-founded, has made 13 acquisitions within the past year, and had revenues of $2.54 billion at the end of 2013.\n\nThe hospital system leaders who judge the Business Journal\u2019s Health Care Heros program invited Massingale, the 2010 Health Care Hero: Administrative Excellence, to join the panel this year.\n\nDr. Richard Briggs, a 2009 Health Care Hero: Physician and a Knox County commissioner, made another leap in public service by defeating incumbent Stacey Campfield for a seat in the Tennessee Senate. Briggs faces Democrat Cheri Siler in the November general election.\n\nJanell Cecil, senior vice president of UT Medical Center, lead the hospital to achieving magnet recognition from the American Nurses Credentialing Center, which led, in part, to her recognition as the 2011 Health Care Hero: Administrative Excellence.\n\nCecil\u2019s leadership has since been tapped by Gov. Bill Haslam, who named her to the Tennessee Board of Nursing in January.\n\nKnoxville Area Project Access, the 2009 Health Care Hero: Community Outreach, has become even more vital in linking struggling individuals with medical care with the advent of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe organization serves as the federal health exchange\u2019s navigator for Knox and surrounding counties, helping individuals and small businesses enroll. The organization also coordinates patient referrals electronically through its DIRECT Project with the state of Tennessee.\n\nSince 2006, Project Access has coordinated more than $130 million dollars in donated health care to more than 18,000 low-income East Tennesseans without access to health insurance or government-sponsored programs.\n\nBen Harrington, 2010 Health Care Hero: Community Outreach, continues to expand the Mental Health Association of East Tennessee\u2019s signature program, Mental Health 101. It helped more than 16,000 children last year and sessions are scheduled in 55 schools so far this year.\n\nIn 2013, MHAET opened a new call center that employs those in recovery to help callers in need of mental health services. The center received more than 2,000 calls in its first year \u2014 an increase of 38 percent for the organization \u2014 and workers placed more than 4,000 follow-up support calls, numbers it is on track to exceed this year. The call center can be reached at 865-584-9125.\n\nBoth programs have been selected for Innovation Nation, a best practice programs registry of Mental Health America, the national organization with which MHAET is affiliated.\n\nDr. Tom Kim, 2012 Health Care Hero: Community Outreach, celebrated in 2013 the 20th anniversary of the first Free Medical Clinic of America, which he founded.\n\nKim\u2019s care for the working poor was celebrated by several organizations this year, as he received the following awards: Directors Community Leadership Award from the FBI; Service Above Self Award, West Knoxville Rotary Club; and the Outstanding American Award, National Wrestling Hall of Fame, Tennessee Chapter\n\nDr. Masoud Panjehpour received the 2013 Health Care Hero: Innovation for his leadership of the Center of Excellence for Treatment of Barrett\u2019s Esophagus at Fort Sanders Regional Medical Center.\n\nHe recently started a new clinical study of patients who have been cured of their Barrett\u2019s esophagus, which seeks to optimize dosing of a new acid reflux medication that is necessary to keep their Barrett\u2019s esophagus from recurring.\n\nAl Kaye, the 2010 Health Care Hero: Non-physician, continues his public service efforts with the Tennessee Department of Health\u2019s Traumatic Brain Injury Program.\n\nKaye, program coordinator for the Patricia Neal Rehabilitation Center\u2019s Innovative Recreation Cooperative, has been inducted into the National Academy of Recreational Therapists as a Fellow, Distinguished in Recreational Therapy and will be recognized as a founding member of the American Therapeutic Recreation Association in September. The Patricia Neal Innovative Recreation Cooperative has been assisting Catalyst Sports out of Atlanta to expand adaptive climbing in the Knoxville area.\n\nJeanne Ezell of Blount Memorial Hospital, 2012 Health Care Hero: Nonphysician, has received the Preceptor of the Year, East Region award from the University of Tennessee\u2019s College of Pharmacy.
