The law also imposes new requirements on insurance plans on what they must cover, and says they must price coverage equally regardless of people\u2019s medical history, and these affect everyone who gets insurance on their own.\n\nSen. John Thune of South Dakota spoke at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council on Tuesday. Ralph Alswang for The Wall Street Journal\n\nIt\u2019s true that the law has made a significant dent in the number of people without insurance, and made sweeping changes to the way coverage operates in America. For critics, the issue isn\u2019t how many people it\u2019s covered \u2013 it\u2019s how many have been left behind.\n\nRepublican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, speaking after Mr. Dach, pointed to Congressional Budget Office estimates suggesting that as many as 35 million people are still without coverage, and 27 million will be uninsured five years from now, to argue the health law has required too much to do too little.\n\n\u201cIt is an incredible amount of disruption to still have that many people uncovered when all is said and done,\u201d he said. Mr. Thune said that Republican replacements for the law all aim to find some way of providing insurance for people with pre-existing conditions that once could have barred them from buying insurance on their own, but with relaxed requirements on what coverage must include, as a way of bringing the price down.\n\nMORE FROM WSJ CEO COUNCIL:\n\nTop Clinton Adviser Says Wealthy Should Pay More in Taxes\n\nObama Adviser Furman Sees Limited Economic Impact From Paris Attacks\n\nDefense Chief Ash Carter Calls on Europe to Do More to Confront ISIS\n\nMarco Rubio Says GOP Rivals Tried to Weaken U.S. Intelligence Efforts", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "[wsj-video guid=\"12EB059C-813A-4771-9B1C-24CDBFDA055C\"] Leslie Dach, Senior Counselor of U.S.", "title": "At WSJ CEO Council, Health Law\u2019s Success Depends on Which Number You Prefer", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/11/17/at-wsj-ceo-council-glass-is-half-full-or-half-empty-on-health-law/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-LH593_DACH_P_20151117105531.jpg"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "At WSJ CEO Council, Health Law\u2019s Success Depends on Which Number You Prefer", "description": "[wsj-video guid=\"12EB059C-813A-4771-9B1C-24CDBFDA055C\"] Leslie Dach, Senior Counselor of U.S.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Louise Radnofsky", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "[wsj-video guid=\"12EB059C-813A-4771-9B1C-24CDBFDA055C\"] Leslie Dach, Senior Counselor of U.S.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-11-17T17:01:38-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-160", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/11/17/at-wsj-ceo-council-glass-is-half-full-or-half-empty-on-health-law/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-59299", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "[wsj-video guid=\"12EB059C-813A-4771-9B1C-24CDBFDA055C\"] Leslie Dach, Senior Counselor of U.S.", "title": "At WSJ CEO Council, Health Law\u2019s Success Depends on Which Number You Prefer", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/11/17/at-wsj-ceo-council-glass-is-half-full-or-half-empty-on-health-law/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-LH593_DACH_P_20151117105531.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-59299", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-11-17T17:05:37-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2084\"", "article_summary": "Sen.
