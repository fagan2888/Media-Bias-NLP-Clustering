The move is retroactive to Thursday.\n\nHundley had hoped to skip a trip to the DL, and tested himself in the batting cage and by doing some sprints Friday. But he made it through only four of his 10 scheduled sprints before stopping his workout.\n\n\u201cI started feeling a little bit woozy,\u201d he said. \u201cI just shut it down and said, \u2018Let\u2019s take it back a notch.\u2019 So now I\u2019m resting and making sure everything gets back to normal as soon as it can.\u201d\n\nHundley said he hadn\u2019t suffered a concussion since 2012, when he was with San Diego.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s been a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cFortunately, I haven\u2019t taken shots like that before. This one was different. I couldn\u2019t shake it off. I\u2019m usually good to go. But this one, even after the game, it wouldn\u2019t go away.\u201d\n\nRight-handed pitcher David Hale took Hundley\u2019s spot on the roster, getting called up from Triple-A Albuquerque to provide bullpen depth. He pitched 1 innings Saturday in Colorado\u2019s 6-2 loss to the Cubs, giving up a three-run homer to former Rockies center fielder Dexter Fowler in the seventh inning.\n\nTime for Trevor Story to have a rest?\n\nRookie shortstop Trevor Story, who began the season in historic fashion by hitting six home runs in his first four games, has struck out 20 times in 48 at-bats this season. He has walked only twice.\n\nStory hit a double off reliever Travis Wood in the ninth inning Saturday and scored on Carlos Gonzalez\u2019s homer. But he is struggling, and a day off in the near future is a possibility.\n\nAsked if he was pleased to see Story produce a solid hit in the ninth, manager Walt Weiss said, \u201cIt\u2019s a long season. There are ups and downs, but I haven\u2019t seen Trevor get away from his approach at all. He stayed on that ball and shot it down the right-field line. It was a nice piece of hitting.\u201d\n\nDay off for DJ LeMahieu\n\nSecond baseman DJ LeMahieu was stretching intently on the infield just before the ninth inning of Colorado\u2019s 6-1 victory over the Cubs on Friday. He was not in the lineup Saturday because of groin tightness. Weiss said it\u2019s considered a minor problem, but he gave LeMahieu the day off and started Cristhian Adames at second base and in the leadoff spot.\n\nJon Gray update\n\nRight-handed starter Jon Gray, on the 15-day disabled list because of an abdominal strain, pitched four innings, gave up three runs and four hits and struck out eight Friday for Single-A Modesto against Stockton. Gray is expected to rejoin the Rockies soon, most likely for an April 22 start against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Coors Field. However, it\u2019s possible he will make one more minor-league rehab start.\n\n\n\nPatrick Saunders, The Denver Post\n\nRockies RHP Tyler Chatwood (1-1, 4.38 ERA) at Cubs LHP Jon Lester (1-0, 2.77)\n\nWhen: 12:20 p.m. Sunday\n\nTV/Radio: ROOT; 850 AM\n\nChatwood was just so-so in his last start, losing to the Giants at Coors Field. He gave up five runs on 11 hits in six innings. He might have come out of it OK had he not served up two costly home runs. Chatwood has never pitched at Wrigley Field. Rockies fans might remember Lester as the pitcher who earned the win in Game 4 of the World Series in 2007. He has made two regular-season starts against the Rockies, going 1-1 with a 1.93 ERA. Last season, on July 29, he struck out 14 Rockies and allowed two runs on five hits over eight innings.\n\nMonday: Rockies RHP Jordan Lyles (0-1, 11.25 ERA) at Reds RHP Alfredo Simon (0-1, 12.15), 5:10 p.m., ROOT\n\nTuesday: Rockies LHP Jorge De La Rosa (1-1, 8.80) at Reds RHP Raisel Iglesias (1-1, 3.24), 5:10 p.m., ROOT\n\nWednesday: Rockies RHP Chad Bettis (2-0, 2.95) at Reds RHP Tim Melville (0-1, 9.00), 10:35 a.m., no TV; 850 AM\n\nThursday: Off", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies catcher Nick Hundley placed on seven-day concussion disabled list", "title": "Rockies catcher Nick Hundley placed on seven-day concussion disabled list", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/16/rockies-catcher-nick-hundley-placed-on-seven-day-concussion-disabled-list/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160416__SP13BBNROCKIES_BL19533xp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160416__SP13BBNROCKIES_BL19533xp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-16T20:06:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T03:43:57+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "CHICAGO \u2014 Catcher Nick Hundley, shaken up on a foul tip Wednesday night at Coors Field, landed on the seven-day concussion disabled list Saturday.\nMonday: Rockies RHP Jordan Lyles (0-1, 11.25 ERA) at Reds RHP Alfredo Simon (0-1, 12.15), 5:10 p.m., ROOTTuesday: Rockies LHP Jorge De La Rosa (1-1, 8.80) at Reds RHP Raisel Iglesias (1-1, 3.24), 5:10 p.m., ROOTWednesday: Rockies RHP Chad Bettis (2-0, 2.95) at Reds RHP Tim Melville (0-1, 9.00), 10:35 a.m., no TV; 850 AMThursday: Off\nLast season, on July 29, he struck out 14 Rockies and allowed two runs on five hits over eight innings.\nHe has made two regular-season starts against the Rockies, going 1-1 with a 1.93 ERA.\nRockies fans might remember Lester as the pitcher who earned the win in Game 4 of the World Series in 2007."}
