(KOIN 6 News)\n\nPORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN 6) \u2014 When Alta Lund was born, Roosevelt was president. Teddy Roosevelt.\n\nAlta Lund was born in Colton on Christmas Day in 1906. She celebrated her 108th birthday with her daughter, Dolores Crawford, and grandson, Bill Crawford at the facility where she lives.\n\nShe\u2019s lived her whole life in Oregon \u2013 mostly in Roseburg, Eugene and Tillamook. She married Fred Lund, who at one time was the mayor of Glendale, Oregon.\n\n\u201cShe really is a treasure. She only came here (to the Nehalem Valley Care Center) two years ago. She lived alone all that time, did her own cooking and everything,\u201d said her daughter, Dolores Crawford.\n\n\u201cEverytime I tell my friends that my grandmother is 108 years old, their mouths drop open. It is just amazing,\u201d said Bill Crawford. \u201cStill has all of her memory. The only thing she has a problem with right now, basically, is her hearing.\u201d\n\nHer daughter said she\u2019s \u201cstill got her tonsils and everything.\u201d She\u2019s always been healthy, always worked outside and loved to garden, Dolores said.\n\nNow she plays Bingo and takes part in the field activities at the center.\n\nSometimes they visit and \u201cshare her love of watching TV westerns,\u201d Bill said. That may be in part because when she was born most people still had horses.\n\n\u201cThat was the only way to get around,\u201d Alta Lund said.\n\nBill said the family has \u201cfond memories of my grandmother and my grandpa Fred. She was an incredible lady back then and moreso now, and I\u2019m thankful she is still with us.\u201d\n\nThe only drawback is she said she\u2019s never gotten any presents on her birthday \u2014 just Christmas presents.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.", "article_metadata": {"norton-safeweb-site-verification": "46bykeo2i0s-akw2xw95c4niny8dm8q2hq2q--p6sq9m44il5276m4e6zl3aewxb9eje2k-8ahjwqf4l2xznzs7ryf88y3cugtu9sy16hu69onbc-aftcwjs4pwj7f74", "zipcodes": "97201, 97203, 97204, 97205, 97206, 97207, 97208, 97209, 97210, 97211, 97212, 97213, 97214, 97215, 97216, 97227, 97266, 97005, 97225, 97015, 98661, 97030", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=411685184", "og": {"site_name": "KOIN 6", "description": "When Alta Lund was born, Roosevelt was president.
