Americans want safety, stability and sustainability.\u201d\n\nHe said the country needed \u201cfresh ideas.\u201d\n\n\u201cCampaigns are the time for debates about the vision of our future and for voters to assess the character and experience of those offering ideas,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Chafee, who in the course of his political career has switched parties from Republican to independent to Democrat, slammed Republicans under former President George W. Bush for leaving the economy \u201cin a shambles.\u201d He then praised President Obama, saying he \u201cled admirably\u201d and \u201chas revived our economy.\u201d\n\nMr. Chafee served as Republican senator from 1999 to 2007, but because of some of his liberal policy positions, he was dismissed by some conservatives as a \u201cRINO\u201d (\u201cRepublican in Name only\u201d).\n\nHe switched to independent and became governor of Rhode Island. Facing a tough re-election contest for governor in 2013, he switched to Democrat but then dropped out of the race.\n\n\u201cThroughout my career, I exercised good judgment on a wide range of high-pressure decisions \u2014 decisions that require levelheadedness and careful foresight,\u201d Mr. Chafee said in the video. \u201cOften these decisions came in the face of political adversity. During the next weeks and months I look forward to sharing with you my thoughts about the future of our great country.\u201d\n\nMost polls so far have not included Mr. Chafee.\n\nHe joins a handful of long shot Democratic candidates eyeing the race, including Vice President Joseph R. Biden, former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont and former Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia.\n\nThey would be taking on former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is expected to announce her run within weeks and remains the odds-on favorite to win the Democratic nomination.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lincoln Chafee, a former governor and senator from Rhode Island, announced Thursday that he is considering a 2016 presidential run as a Democrat.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Lincoln Chafee, a former governor and senator from Rhode Island, announced Thursday that he is considering a 2016 presidential run as a Democrat.", "title": "Lincoln Chafee explores 2016 presidential run as Democrat", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/9/lincoln-chafee-explores-2016-presidential-run-demo/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/09/DEM_2016_Chafee.JPEG-0b682.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/09/DEM_2016_Chafee.JPEG-0b682.jpg", "description": "Lincoln Chafee, a former governor and senator from Rhode Island, announced Thursday that he is considering a 2016 presidential run as a Democrat.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Lincoln Chafee explores 2016 presidential run as Democrat"}, "Author": "S.A.
