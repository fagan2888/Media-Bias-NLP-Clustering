Support for Romney was particularly strong among white residents in that region.\n\n\n\nAnd, \"most whites in general, but particularly whites from the South, have unfavorable views toward [Obamacare], and that goes for the middle-income group as well,\" said Mollyann Brodie, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, citing recent public polling by that health-care policy research organization.\n\nEvery state in the South with the exception of Kentucky is served by the federal Obamacare exchange HealthCare.gov, since their governments rejected the option of running their own ACA marketplace. Thirteen states and the District of Columbia are operating their own health insurance marketplaces.\n\nThe Supreme Court case hinges on a purported legal distinction between a federally run exchange and one operated by a state. The high court is set to hear arguments in the case on March 4.\n\nThe ACA explicitly says that subsidies or tax credits to help pay for premiums as well as for out-of-pocket health costs can be issued to customers of a state-established exchange. Although the ACA talks about the creation of a federal exchange in states that choose not to run their own marketplace, it doesn't say anything explicitly about such subsidies being issued to customers of such an exchange.\n\nRead MoreHealthCare.gov hits 7.1M sign-ups\n\n\n\nThe Obama administration nonetheless claims the HealthCare.gov subsidies are legal because the ACA contemplates the need for HealthCare.gov, and that the ACA's goal of significantly reducing the number of uninsured implicitly means that tax credits have to be available to customers nationally, regardless of the particular flavor of exchange.\n\nThe tax credits are worth billions of dollars, and helped to lower premium costs for a large majority of enrollees of HealthCare.gov. Such tax credits issued to customers of state-run exchanges are not at risk from the Supreme Court challenge.\n\n\n\nThe administration filed a brief Wednesday night with the high court outlining its position in defense of the subsidies.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Obamacare customers who are white, live in the South and have modest incomes would be the biggest losers if the Supreme Court kills HealthCare.gov subsidies.", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, HealthCare.gov, who's hit, supreme court, subsidies end", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Obamacare customers who are white, live in the South and have modest incomes would be the big losers if the Supreme Court kills HealthCare.gov subsidies.", "title": "Guess who's hit if Obamacare subsidies go away", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/01/22/who-suffers-if-obamacare-subsidies-go-away-surprise.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/11/12/102179014-RTR4DLHN.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obamacare customers who are white, live in the South and have modest incomes would be the big losers if the Supreme Court kills HealthCare.gov subsidies.", "creator": "@_DanMangan", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/01/22/who-suffers-if-obamacare-subsidies-go-away-surprise.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/11/12/102179014-RTR4DLHN.1910x1000.jpg"}, "title": "Who suffers if Obamacare subsidies go away?
