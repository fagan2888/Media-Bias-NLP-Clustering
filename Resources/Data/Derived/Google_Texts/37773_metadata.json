We\u2019ve heard the reports. The \u201ccrisis at the border.\u201d Refugee kids \u201cstreaming\u201d into our country, portending \u201ccalamitous\u201d consequences.\n\nAnd I agree. Thousands of kids showing up at our doorstep without parents to take care of them is a crisis, though I think of it as one of humanitarian dimensions. What do we do with these children? What\u2019s our responsibility to them, their undocumented status notwithstanding? What response is most consistent with our values as a country and a people? That\u2019s a complicated question, and one that reasonable people can disagree about.\n\nBut to get the full measure of what\u2019s transpiring at the border, I think you have to look at both sides of the line. The angry protestors, waving signs and flags, intent on driving these children back to where they came from without delay \u2014 they illustrate a second crisis in this country, only this one is of a political or ideological nature. Here\u2019s what I mean.\n\n[SEE: Cartoons on Immigration]\n\nThink about the kinds of issues that affect you everyday. Maybe they have to do with your job. Or your paycheck. Maybe they have to do with health care or your mortgage costs. Or the school your kids go to. Or your car, and how it keeps breaking down.\n\nThese are immediate and at least to some extent economic concerns that impact the things you have to do to get through your day. And they\u2019re the kinds of things that lots of us think about when we consider who to vote for. Is this candidate someone I can trust to, for example, focus on creating good jobs for people like me? Is this someone who believes families like mine should have health care they can afford? Will he or she take an interest in improving our schools, or are they more focused on other things?\n\nNow think about those who are showing up at the border. Getting up, making a sign, getting in your car, joining a protest \u2026 those are things that take time and effort. That\u2019s more than most of us do about any issue, no matter how important. But for these folks, making sure children don\u2019t get into our country is so animating they\u2019re out there on the ground, literally turning buses around.\n\n[ READ: Time for Legislating, Not Race Baiting]\n\nAre their values consistent with yours? Do you share their sense of urgency and priority? I think for most of us, whether we are Democrats or Republicans, the answer is clearly: no. Or there would be a lot more of us standing with them.\n\nBut because a small group of hard-right conservatives have taken it upon themselves to become a de facto border patrol, they are getting a massive amount of media coverage. And because they hail from the same pool of activists who are exercising a disproportionate amount of influence over the Republican party these days, they are also exerting a disproportionate amount of influence over national policy.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the second crisis I\u2019m talking about. Because a small, vocal, angry, minority is doing more than just holding signs at the border. They\u2019re blocking any effort to reduce gun violence. Defending policies that benefit the wealthy at the expense of the middle class and those lower down the socioeconomic ladder. Pushing to dismantle basic safety net programs. Trying to narrow the basic freedoms women, African-Americans and Latinos, and the LGBTQ community have fought long and hard to gain. And they\u2019re the engine that drives us towards, and over, the fiscal cliff every few months, flirting with actual calamity.\n\n[SEE: Cartoons about the Republican Party]\n\nIn a few months we have another election. By all accounts, Democrats have ground to make up to win back the House, and control of the Senate hangs in the balance. If more Republicans win campaigns, it is very likely we\u2019ll have more representatives of the radical fringe arriving in Washington. And if that happens, our national policy will get pushed even further right, and even further away from the values that guide most Americans of both parties.\n\nSo it seems to me that while the solution to crisis number one at the border \u2014 how best to respond to the arrival of thousands of refugee children \u2014 is one well worth debating, the solution to crisis number two couldn\u2019t be clearer.
