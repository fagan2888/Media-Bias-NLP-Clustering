(The mutts only get the chance to compete in agility, not in the breed judging on Monday and Tuesday.)\n\nHailey\u2019s owner, Karen Profenna of New City, N.Y., was excited about the competition but circumspect about Hailey\u2019s chances. The energetic 8-year-old \u201cBoggle,\u201d as the mix is called, is an experienced competitor and practices in the winter months in indoor training facilities.\n\n\u201cJust like people, everybody has a good day, everybody has a bad day, we\u2019re going to give it our best,\u201d Ms. Profenna said.\n\nAlfie, a mixed breed, demonstrates his mastery of an agility test during a news conference on January 15. Associated Press\n\nThe array of 15 mixed-breed dogs competing Saturday includes a handful of local dogs. Panda, a likely mix of Australian Shepherd or Australian Cattle Dog and Border Collie, according to her owner, Stacy Eastman, took her first agility course at about 12 weeks old; she is now 8. Ms. Eastman, who lives in Chester, N.J., adopted her through Petfinder.com.\n\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d get to go to Westminster with the dogs, because I have the mixes,\u201d she said. (Ms. Eastman\u2019s other dog, Barley, will not be competing.)\n\nFor Alfie, a 7-year-old poodle-terrier, agility was a way to harness his energy.\n\n\u201cThe terrier in him, he was just bounding all over the place,\u201d said his owner, Irene Palmerini of Toms River, N.J. \u201cAgility was a way to focus that energy into something positive.\u201d\n\nTo get her dog Crime used to a see-saw, Debra Lazaro of Jackson, N.J., trained him to close drawers, which got him comfortable with the feeling of things moving under his paws.\n\nMs. Lazaro said Crime, a Staffordshire bull terrier-Border Collie mix, was bred specifically for sports and performance.\n\n\u201cHe has the musculature of the Staffie bull and the speed of a Border Collie and the brain of both,\u201d she said. She credits his good looks with helping him land two film roles.\n\nShe said she has to stay in shape to keep up with him because he is so fast.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mentally and physically challenging,\u201d Ms. Lazaro said of the agility course. \u201cWhen it all comes together and it\u2019s a great run, it\u2019s like a runner\u2019s high.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "15 mixed-breed dogs will be competing in the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show\u2019s inaugural Masters Agility Championship Saturday, a rare chance for the non-purebred set to take part in the esteemed show.", "title": "Mixed-Breed Dogs To Show Their Chops at Westminster Dog Show", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/02/07/mixed-breed-dogs-to-show-their-chops-at-westminster-dog-show/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/PJ-BT026_mixedb_P_20140203183507.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "Mixed-Breed Dogs To Show Their Chops at Westminster Dog Show", "description": "15 mixed-breed dogs will be competing in the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show\u2019s inaugural Masters Agility Championship Saturday, a rare chance for the non-purebred set to take part in the esteemed show.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Jennifer Weiss", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "15 mixed-breed dogs will be competing in the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show\u2019s inaugural Masters Agility Championship Saturday, a rare chance for the non-purebred set to take part in the esteemed show.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-02-07T15:00:42-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/02/07/mixed-breed-dogs-to-show-their-chops-at-westminster-dog-show/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-19804", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "15 mixed-breed dogs will be competing in the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show\u2019s inaugural Masters Agility Championship Saturday, a rare chance for the non-purebred set to take part in the esteemed show.", "title": "Mixed-Breed Dogs To Show Their Chops at Westminster Dog Show", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/02/07/mixed-breed-dogs-to-show-their-chops-at-westminster-dog-show/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/PJ-BT026_mixedb_P_20140203183507.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-19804", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-02-10T18:21:01-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd9dc\"", "article_summary": "Associated PressThe array of 15 mixed-breed dogs competing Saturday includes a handful of local dogs.\nMs. Lazaro said Crime, a Staffordshire bull terrier-Border Collie mix, was bred specifically for sports and performance.\nHailey is one of 15 mixed-breed dogs out of the 225 canines competing in the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show\u2019s inaugural Masters Agility Championship Saturday, a rare chance for the non-purebred set to take part in the esteemed show.\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d get to go to Westminster with the dogs, because I have the mixes,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s mentally and physically challenging,\u201d Ms. Lazaro said of the agility course."}
