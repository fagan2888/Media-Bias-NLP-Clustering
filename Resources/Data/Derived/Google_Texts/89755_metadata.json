One official likened the danger to users playing Russian roulette each time they buy a pill on the street.\n\nIn San Francisco, the health department blamed several overdoses last summer on lookalike Xanax containing fentanyl, while Canada has issued warnings about multiple recent cases of lookalike oxycodone pills containing fentanyl.\n\nAnd in suburban Cleveland, federal agents arrested a man this month after seizing more than 900 fentanyl pills marked like oxycodone tablets.\n\n\u201cThese pills are truly a fatal overdose waiting to happen,\u201d said Carole Rendon, acting U.S. attorney in Cleveland.\n\nBecause fentanyl is cheap to manufacture illicitly, dealers see a chance to make more money by disguising it as oxycodone, which typically can sell for more, she said.\n\nLookalike pills were likely to blame for some of the county\u2019s 19 fentanyl-related overdose deaths that came just in January alone, said Dr. Thomas Gilson, the Cuyahoga County medical examiner.\n\n\u201cPeople might otherwise say, \u2018I know I can abuse this much of oxycodone,\u2019 and they may be in for a really, really bad surprise when they find out that\u2019s fentanyl and not oxycodone,\u201d Gilson said.\n\nThe drug, typically used for treatment of chronic pain in end-stage cancer patients, is 25 to 40 times more powerful than heroin. Properly prescribed, it\u2019s often applied through a skin patch. Fentanyl produced for the illegal street market comes from Mexico, while chemically similar components have been traced to China, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nIn a second Ohio indictment, federal authorities have charged a man with obtaining fentanyl from China that killed an addict to whom it was sold in Akron.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New twist in addiction crisis: Deadly painkiller impostors", "author": "Andrew Welsh-huggins", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "New twist in addiction crisis: Deadly painkiller impostors", "title": "New twist in addiction crisis: Deadly painkiller impostors", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/02/29/new_twist_in_addiction_crisis_deadly_painkiller_impostors/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/fentanyl-lookalike-pills.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New twist in addiction crisis: Deadly painkiller impostors", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/fentanyl-lookalike-pills.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "New twist in addiction crisis: Deadly painkiller impostors", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "New twist in addiction crisis: Deadly painkiller impostors", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "And in suburban Cleveland, federal agents arrested a man this month after seizing more than 900 fentanyl pills marked like oxycodone tablets.\nThe drug, typically used for treatment of chronic pain in end-stage cancer patients, is 25 to 40 times more powerful than heroin.\nTopics: From the Wires, Life News, NewsCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Authorities are sounding the alarm about a new and deadly twist in the country\u2019s drug-addiction crisis in the form of a potent painkiller disguised as other medications.\nIn San Francisco, the health department blamed several overdoses last summer on lookalike Xanax containing fentanyl, while Canada has issued warnings about multiple recent cases of lookalike oxycodone pills containing fentanyl.\nOne official likened the danger to users playing Russian roulette each time they buy a pill on the street."}
