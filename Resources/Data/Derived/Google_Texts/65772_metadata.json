But the answer is not to throw out of work and deport the 11 million immigrants who are contributing already to our economy. The answer is to grow our economy to create more jobs.\"\n\nClinton made the comments at a Chicago Ideas Week event during which she was interviewed by Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who knows Clinton from his time working in her husband's administration and serving as President Barack Obama's first chief of staff.\n\nBrat told NBC's Chuck Todd on Wednesday that \"amnesty at the end was a clear differentiator between myself and Eric Cantor ... it also fits into the narrative that Eric just has not been present in the district, and he was out of touch and supporting, you know, the Chamber [of Commerce] agenda on that one instead of -- I was door knocking, I know what -- what's on the mind of the folks.\"\n\nBrat will face fellow Randolph-Macon College professor Jack Trammell (D) in the general election.\n\nClinton is continuing on her book tour while speculation swirls about her potential 2016 presidential run.\n\n(h/t BuzzFeed)\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Eric Cantor Eric Cantor\n\n1 of 27 Eric Cantor WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 28: House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA) speaks to the media after attending the weekly House Republican conference at the U.S. Capitol January 28, 2014 in Washington, DC.
