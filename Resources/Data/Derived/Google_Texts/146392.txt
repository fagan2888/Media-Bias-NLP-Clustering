Billboards and a police YouTube video are warning parents to be on the lookout for marijuana-infused candies in their children’s trick-or-treat bags.

But this year should be no different for parents, who should always employ common sense on Halloween. Throw out any unwrapped candy and inspect all packaging before letting your kids gorge on treats.

If the package looks suspicious, tampered with, torn, unwrapped or in unfamiliar packaging, throw out the candy. That should be the same message every year.

Edible candies infused with marijuana must be packaged in a way that clearly identifies them as containing marijuana.

Yes, as the billboards and video point out, there are edible marijuana candies that look exactly like normal candies, and that’s not good. And edibles make up a significant portion of retail marijuana sales.

But they’re not cheap, either. A 10-piece package of pot-infused gummy bears, for example, retails for about $27 before taxes. So perhaps that will be a deterrent to anyone sick enough to want to give such candy to unsuspecting children.

Anyone who hands out pot-laced candy could face felony criminal charges.

Parents, beware, but this Halloween shouldn’t be scarier than any other.
