Sitting in a tall chair increased a person\u2019s sense of self and led to higher levels of frugality and saving, compared to sitting on a low ottoman.\n\nInability to save money can stem from various issues \u2014 such as self-control, family background, and even education. But what are the psychological reasons behind it? While collecting money can often increase feelings of power, researchers wanted to see if exhibiting a sense of power could in turn boost incentive to save funds. \u201cWe were interested in knowing whether the decision to save or not save money was affected by how someone was feeling during the time they were making a savings decision,\u201d Emily N. Garbinsky and Jennifer Aaker, authors of the study from Stanford University, wrote in a press release.\n\nThe participants were placed in either a tall chair or low ottoman, asked to respond to questions, and then given the option to take their study compensation in cash or place it in a lab savings account. Those who sat in the tall chair saved more than those who sat in the ottoman. \u201cWe show that individuals who feel powerful save more because it enables them to maintain their current state,\u201d the authors wrote in their study.\n\n\u201cPeople who feel powerful use saving money as a means to maintain their current state of power,\u201d the authors concluded. \u201cWhen saving no longer affords individuals the opportunity to maintain power, the effect of power on saving disappears.\u201d They hope their research can aid in creating future intervention programs to help people save money. They also aim to extend their research to better investigate the relationship between power, saving, and income level: \u201cparticularly how income level interacts with feelings of power to affect saving,\u201d they wrote.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "saving money, psychology, feeling powerful", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "People who sat in a tall chair were more likely to save money compared to individuals sitting in a low ottoman, a study found.", "title": "The Best Way To Save Money Is To Make Yourself Feel Powerful", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/boosting-self-esteem-and-feeling-powerful-can-help-you-save-money-290144", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/26/piggy-bank.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "People who sat in a tall chair were more likely to save money compared to individuals sitting in a low ottoman, a study found.", "title": "The Best Way To Save Money Is To Make Yourself Feel Powerful", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/boosting-self-esteem-and-feeling-powerful-can-help-you-save-money-290144", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/26/piggy-bank.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/26/piggy-bank.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-06-26T15:20:10-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-26T15:20:09-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "People who sat in a tall chair were more likely to save money compared to individuals sitting in a low ottoman, a study found."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca986\"", "article_summary": "Inability to save money can stem from various issues \u2014 such as self-control, family background, and even education.\n\u201cPeople who feel powerful use saving money as a means to maintain their current state of power,\u201d the authors concluded.\nA boost in self-esteem and sense of power can assist in saving money, according to a new study out of Stanford University and Tilburg University.\n\u201cWhen saving no longer affords individuals the opportunity to maintain power, the effect of power on saving disappears.\u201d They hope their research can aid in creating future intervention programs to help people save money.\n\u201cWe show that individuals who feel powerful save more because it enables them to maintain their current state,\u201d the authors wrote in their study."}
