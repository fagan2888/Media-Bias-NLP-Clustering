Leoneda Inge reports Sen. Kay Hagan wants extended sign-up for Affordable Care.

North Carolina Senator Kay Hagan can be added to the list of Obama allies who is also critical of healthcare.gov, the federal government's health care exchange website.

Senator Kay Hagan has not been afraid to speak her mind about the rocky roll-out of the Affordable Care Act. She’s voiced her concerns on Twitter and during a visit to N.C. State yesterday.

“You know, I’m just as frustrated as my constituents are. We’ve got to be assured that we get a website that works," said Hagan.

Hagan wants the Obama administration to delay the health insurance sign-up period by two months.

Open enrollment for the marketplace to link uninsured Americans with private health insurers began on October 1 and runs through March 31. Hagan is calling for open enrollment to go until May 31, and for the penalty to be waived.
