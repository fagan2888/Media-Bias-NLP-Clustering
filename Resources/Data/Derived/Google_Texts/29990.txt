Sioux Falls, SD

A Sioux Falls family is mourning the loss of a loved one New Year's Day while a 20-year-old sits in jail following a deadly crash early Wednesday morning.

The crash happened around 1:30 a.m. Wednesday at the intersection of 10th Street and Sycamore Avenue.

Sioux Falls Police say Oscar Madrigal is charged with vehicular homicide and his second DWI after he drove through a flashing red stop light and hit a minivan, killing the female passenger.

"I've seen three or four crashes. I think this is one of the worst ones I have seen, yes," Elite Limousine owner Glenn Fenwick said.

Fenwick was driving home New Year's partiers when he drove up to the scene of the deadly crash at 10th and Sycamore.

"I think it happened minutes before I got there, if not seconds," Fenwick said.

Fenwick says it’s frustrating that people still drink and drive.

"There's so many ways to get a ride home. There are taxi companies, there are limo companies such as myself, there's free rides home last night (New Year’s Eve). No one is saying to not party just to get a ride home; a safe ride home," Fenwick said.

And according to police if a 20-year-old Sioux Falls man would have followed that advice on New Year's Eve a deadly crash could have been prevented.

"If he would have just got a ride home everything would have been fine today and unfortunately things like this happen and today he's paying the consequences," Fenwick said.

Consequences that are being felt by two families on the first day of 2014.

The name of the victim has not been released.
