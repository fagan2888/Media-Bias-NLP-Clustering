"article_text": "A federal effort to sweep up records about Americans\u2019 emails was secretly replaced before it came to light in 2013, according to an inspector general report revealed through a public records lawsuit on Friday.\n\nAccording to the National Security Agency\u2019s (NSA) watchdog report, the email records program was destroyed by December of 2011, but had been replaced with other systems that \u201ccan satisfy certain foreign intelligence requirements\u201d that the original program \u201cwas designed to meet.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s report was obtained by The New York Times following a lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nThe disclosure appeared to confirm the suspicions of privacy advocates, who have warned that the NSA has taken advantage of a range of intelligence laws to conduct broad surveillance.\n\nAfter the report was published on Friday, American Civil Liberties Union legislative counsel Neema Singh Guliani called it \u201cyet another piece of evidence demonstrating the need for more comprehensive surveillance reform.\u201d\n\nThe NSA\u2019s email records program is separate from its collection of metadata about Americans\u2019 phone calls, which is set to expire later this month under legislation passed by Congress this summer.\n\nAfter the email records program came to light in 2013, the government said that it had been shut down in 2011.\n\nHowever, the NSA merely switched to other legal authorities to get similar information, the inspector general report indicated, including a controversial legal section that critics have called \u201cbackdoor\u201d surveillance on Americans.\n\nThe law \u2014 known as Section 702 of the 2008 update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \u2014 is targeted at foreigners, but lets the NSA sweep up information about Americans as long as it is \u201cincidental.\u201d Because of the global nature of Internet cable systems, however, critics warn that the spy agency\u2019s ability to gather Americans\u2019 information is virtually limitless.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Other legal powers replaced the NSA's
