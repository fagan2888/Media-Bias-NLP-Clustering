I wish the major events of 2013 provided evidence to pierce the darkness, but all I can find is one ray of hope.\n\nThe political year was certainly gloomy. In January, hope sprung eternal concerning President Barack Obama: Fresh off an electoral victory, might he move from first-term agitator to second-term statesman? By the fall, it was clear that ideology once again had trumped prudence.\n\nNowhere was that more evident than in the Obamacare debate. The president had pushed through a centralization of medical power by the thinnest of margins in the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the Supreme Court. It turned out that to win he had made false claims, stating repeatedly that forced equality would not violate the liberty of individuals to choose their own doctors. In 2013, millions of Americans learned differently, and Obamacare failures became fodder for bitter comedians.\n\nWe see you\u2019ve been enjoying the content on our exclusive member website.

Analysts debated which was the larger factor, but late in the year good economic news tended to bring market declines because investors feared that a true recovery would force the Fed to halt its dangerous artifices.\n\nThe foreign policy year brought one disaster after another. Syria\u2019s fratricide went on and on, with President Obama abandoning a pledge to push back against chemical warfare. Iran continued to pursue nuclear weapons, with signatures on a piece of paper looking like those in Munich 75 years ago. China, Russia, and even North Korea flexed as the United States fluttered.\n\nNowhere was Obama diplomacy more in need of a reset than in the administration\u2019s cultural imperialism. In one small but poignant example, Croatia (a 90 percent Catholic country grown out of the former Yugoslavia) in 2013 decided to vote on a constitutional amendment to affirm traditional marriage. The U.S. State Department dispatched diplomats to push gay rights there and elsewhere. Outcome: Croatians in December voted 2-1 against same-sex nuptials.\n\nIN ALL THESE AREAS our mainstream press failed America by presenting stories almost always based in secular liberal assumptions. Maybe this becomes clearer if we look at an Associated Press story from 70 years ago:\n\n\u201cGestapo head Heinrich Himmler has stared down protesters, laughed off those who call him \u2018gypsy killer,\u2019 and smiled through clenched teeth while bantering with people who want to close his concentration camps. He\u2019s facing some of the biggest pressure he has ever seen. \u2026 \u2018If they think they\u2019re going to make me feel badly about what I do\u2014not gonna happen.\u2019 Just as protesters say they are following God\u2019s will by praying outside concentration camps, Himmler said he, too, is led by divine guidance to provide a place to terminate gypsies: \u2018I feel like God wants me to do this job.\u2019 Concentration camp supporters said Himmler is doing important work: \u2018It really matters tremendously\u2014the courage, the bravery, the self-sacrifice to keep defending our right to improve Europe.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s outrageous, you might think: AP wouldn\u2019t have praised a Nazi mass murderer. You\u2019re right. That story never happened, back then. But if you change \u201cconcentration camp\u201d to \u201cabortion clinic,\u201d \u201cgypsy\u201d to \u201cbaby,\u201d and Himmler to an abortionist, you\u2019ll have the essence of an Associated Press story from 2013 that ran in many newspapers under the headline, \u201cAbortion clinic owner stays committed despite pressure.\u201d (See, for example, charlotteobserver.com/2013/11/23/4491614/abortion-clinic-owner-committed.html.) AP nowhere argued that unborn children are not human beings, but such an assumption underlay the story, making abortion seem a reasonable procedure rather than an atrocity God hates.\n\nIN THE FACE OF political, economic, and foreign policy gloom-inducers, along with press failure to tell the truth, it would be great to hold up Christian institutions as beacons of light rather than beakers containing more toxic chemicals. But 2013 was a troubling year for leadership in many long-respected Christian groups. Examples: Vision Forum and Exodus died as their leaders faltered, while the Council of Christian Colleges and Universities and the American Bible Society (ABS) chewed up and spat out presidents.\n\nThe ABS story in some ways shows in microcosm what Christianity in America faces. ABS began in 1816, a year after the United States survived a war with Britain begun when the U.S. Department of State protested not only British impressment of American sailors but also British harassment of American missionaries in India and elsewhere. The first ABS president was Elias Boudinot, who had been president of the Continental Congress in the 1780s. The second was John Jay, who had been chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. The ABS vice president from 1817 until his death in 1843 was Francis Scott Key, who had seen bombs bursting in the air and then written what became the national anthem.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "WORLD", "description": "\u2018DARK GLOOMINESS.\u2019 That\u2019s how Joel Belz in our last issue characterized the expectations of many WORLD readers who wrote to him about the cultural challenges", "title": "WORLD | 2013 news of the year | Marvin Olasky | Jan. 11, 2014", "url": "http://www.worldmag.com/2013/12/2013_news_of_the_year", "image": "http://www.worldmag.com/media/images/content/inauguration_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "world magazine, christian world news magazine, christian views, christian perspectives, god's world magazine", "description": "\u2018DARK GLOOMINESS.\u2019 That\u2019s how Joel Belz in our last issue characterized the expectations of many WORLD readers who wrote to him about the cultural challenges"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc96d6\"", "article_summary": "The first ABS president was Elias Boudinot, who had been president of the Continental Congress in the 1780s.\nSyria\u2019s fratricide went on and on, with President Obama abandoning a pledge to push back against chemical warfare.\nIn January, hope sprung eternal concerning President Barack Obama: Fresh off an electoral victory, might he move from first-term agitator to second-term statesman?\nIN ALL THESE AREAS our mainstream press failed America by presenting stories almost always based in secular liberal assumptions.\nI wish the major events of 2013 provided evidence to pierce the darkness, but all I can find is one ray of hope."}
