(Photo by Charley Gallay/Getty Images for Jumpstart)\n\n4279773\n\nThe White House tried to get Bill Nye (of Science Guy fame) to promote Obamacare to \u201cgeeks,\u201d according to White House emails obtained by Buzzfeed.\n\nBill Nye\u2019s gotten increasingly involved in liberal politics since his 90\u2019s heyday hosting a children\u2019s science show on PBS. The White House emailed Nye on the (original) last day of Obamacare\u2019s open enrollment period, asking Nye and apparently several others to encourage \u201cgeeks\u201d to sign up for Obamacare coverage on Twitter.\n\n\u201cThanks for all your help in the past month for #GeeksGetCovered,\u201d the email from White House senior advisor Phil Larson began. \u201cLet\u2019s make sure on this last day of enrollment our future scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs and other geeks know where to get covered. Below are some ideas for tweets and retweets. Would love you to put out a few today with healthcare.gov and #geeksgetcovered in them.\u201d\n\nOne so-called recommended geek tweet read, \u201cIt\u2019s finals day \u2014 final day to #GetCovered that is. #GeeksGetCovered at healthcare.gov before midnight tonight!\u201d\n\nAnother stereotypical suggestion was \u201cHey procrastigeeks\u2013finish that paper or 3rd trial of your double-blind experiment and go to healthcare.gov b4 clock strikes midnight.\u201d\n\nSadly enough, it looks like Nye didn\u2019t end up tweeting in support of Obamacare on deadline day, potentially leaving thousands of \u201cprocrastigeeks\u201d without a final push. Nye did tweet several days before the final email a picture of himself with President Obama and Neil deGrasse Tyson, a fellow liberal and PBS children\u2019s science phenomenon.\n\nThese 3 Geeks are covered. Let\u2019s pull the US into the 21st Century.
