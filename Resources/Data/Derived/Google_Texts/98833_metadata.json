Now, the fragrance industry\u2019s leading trade association, the International Fragrance Association (IFRA), opposes the creation of the fragrance-free label claiming that the Safer Choice fragrance-free label would be misleading.\n\nThe reason the EPA created the fragrance-free label is that there are many consumers who want a fragrance-free product because they have found that they experience adverse health effects from products that contain \u201cfragrance\u201d in the list of ingredients. The well-documented health effects from fragrance exposure include rashes and skin conditions, headaches, eye irritation, exacerbation of asthma and other breathing problems.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCertain individuals with extreme chemical sensitivities can also experience much more serious adverse effects to fragrance exposure. IFRA is opposing Safer Choice\u2019s definition of \u201cfragrance-free\u201d because it differs from the industry standard definition, stating:\n\n\u201c\u2026 in general the industry defines fragrance-free products as those that do not contain fragrance compounds to impart or change the scent of the final product and its ingredients. Some materials used in perfumery might still be present in a \u201cfragrance free\u201d product because these are present for purposes other than scenting or malodor coverage. These are called dual use materials. In contrast, EPA would not permit the use of dual use materials in a \u201cfragrance-free\u201d product, even if they are present as a solvent or surfactant.\"\n\nIFRA makes the argument that these \u201cdual-use\u201d materials should be allowed in \u201cfragrance-free\u201d products because they aren\u2019t actually imparting a scent to the product. But that argument makes the assumption that we know that it is only the ingredients in fragrance that impart a scent that lead to the adverse health effects experienced by some people.\n\nUnfortunately, due to the long held tradition of trade secrets for fragrance ingredients, we have no such knowledge. All that consumers, scientists and health professionals have access to currently is that fragranced products contain a mystery compound called \u201cfragrance\u201d, and that these products are causing problems for certain individuals. Without ingredient disclosure, it is impossible to distinguish if the problems are associated solely with the scent-imparting fragrance ingredients or also with the surfactants or solvents that are included in fragrance with them. In the name of \u201ctrade secrets\u201d the fragrance industry has intentionally created and maintained this state of ignorance on the behalf of consumers.\n\nThe only logical option Safer Choice has to provide meaningful information to consumers who do not want to be affected by \u201cfragrance\u201d is to certify that a product does not contain ANY of the ingredients used in fragrances.\n\nSwitalski is executive director and Scranton is director of Science and Research of Women's Voices for the Earth.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Fragranced products contain a mystery compound called \u201cfragrance.\"", "description": "Fragranced products contain a mystery compound called \u201cfragrance.\"", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Fragranced products contain a mystery compound called \u201cfragrance.\"", "title": "Fragrance industry \u2018trade secrets\u2019 brought about EPA label", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/244759-fragrance-industry-trade-secrets-brought-about-epa-label", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/244759-fragrance-industry-trade-secrets-brought-about-epa-label", "dcterms.date": "2015-06-12T16:30-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Erin Switalski and Alexandra Scranton", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-12T16:30:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/244759-fragrance-industry-trade-secrets-brought-about-epa-label", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Fragranced products contain a mystery compound called \u201cfragrance.\"", "card": "summary", "title": "Fragrance industry \u2018trade secrets\u2019 brought about EPA label"}, "dcterms.title": "Fragrance industry \u2018trade secrets\u2019 brought about EPA label"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfee1\"", "article_summary": "Now, the fragrance industry\u2019s leading trade association, the International Fragrance Association (IFRA), opposes the creation of the fragrance-free label claiming that the Safer Choice fragrance-free label would be misleading.\nUnfortunately, due to the long held tradition of trade secrets for fragrance ingredients, we have no such knowledge.\nWithout ingredient disclosure, it is impossible to distinguish if the problems are associated solely with the scent-imparting fragrance ingredients or also with the surfactants or solvents that are included in fragrance with them.\nIn the name of \u201ctrade secrets\u201d the fragrance industry has intentionally created and maintained this state of ignorance on the behalf of consumers.\nIn contrast, EPA would not permit the use of dual use materials in a \u201cfragrance-free\u201d product, even if they are present as a solvent or surfactant.\""}
