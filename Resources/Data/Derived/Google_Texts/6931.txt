HARRISBURG — Democratic Gov.-elect Tom Wolf is close to rounding out his Cabinet and picking other top administrators to run two dozen major state agencies.

On Thursday, Wolf announced his selections for state police commissioner, Col. Marcus L. Brown, the superintendent of the Maryland State Police. This week, Wolf also named his picks to run PennDOT, the state prison system and to oversee the state budget.

Still to be named are his secretaries for the Department of Education and Department of Human Services, formerly known as Welfare. Wolf's inauguration is Tuesday.

Many of Wolf's picks served on his transition team, helping him prepare for being the state's top executive, or worked in former Gov. Ed Rendell's administration. Wolf has kept two of Republican Tom Corbett's Cabinet secretaries.

Corbett's PennDOT secretary, Barry Schoch, credited with spearheading a $2.3 billion transportation funding bill through the Legislature, will become Wolf's senior adviser on transportation and infrastructure, chiefly responsible with continued oversight of the bill known as Act 89.

Schoch's replacement at PennDOT is Montgomery County Commissioner Leslie Richards, who also chairs the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission and is a SEPTA board member. She worked as a project manager at an engineering firm.

Wolf also has retained Corbett's corrections secretary, John Wetzel. He is credited with overseeing the largest prison population decline since 1971 due to sentencing changes. The count has fallen by 1,100 inmates.

The Senate must approve Wolf's Cabinet secretaries on a simple majority vote.
