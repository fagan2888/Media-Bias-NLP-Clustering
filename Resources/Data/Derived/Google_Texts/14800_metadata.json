Trumka, who was paid $322,131, was not even one of the nation\u2019s 100 highest-paid union bosses.\n\nRELATED: America\u2019s top labor union bosses raked in millions in 2014\n\nTo be sure, executives at many of America\u2019s largest companies are paid more than the union officers and employees who run the labor unions in Missouri and other states.\n\nBut does it make sense to compare union bosses \u2014 whose pay is taken from the workers they claim to represent \u2014 to the CEOs who pay workers\u2019 salaries?\n\nTim Jones, chairman of the Missouri Club for Growth and former speaker of the Missouri House of Representatives, told Watchdog it\u2019s an \u201capples and oranges\u201d comparison meant to distract from \u201cmassive\u201d union boss salaries.\n\n\u201cMost people would be amazed at how much labor bosses actually do make,\u201d Jones said. \u201cPeople need to know there are labor bosses that are multimillionaires.\u201d\n\nUnlike CEOs who \u201cbelieve people should be paid for the actual value of the labor they provide\u201d and whose businesses create the profits that keep workers employed, Jones said, union leaders espouse a \u201cflattening of everyone\u2019s wages\u201d that clashes with their own plump paychecks.\n\nHe called it hypocritical for union bosses to make a living selling \u201csolidarity\u201d to workers who are forced to pay them.\n\n\u201cHow much solidarity is there when the labor bosses are taking home six-figure paychecks?\u201d Jones asked.\n\nJones, who sponsored a right-to-work bill in the past legislative session, expects the Missouri General Assembly to hold an override vote Wednesday on Gov. Jay Nixon\u2019s veto of the right-to-work bill passed this spring.\n\nWhatever the outcome, Jones said Missouri Club for Growth will continue supporting lawmakers who vote to let workers choose whether to pay union dues.\n\nAs Watchdog reported last week, two of the union officials leading the \u201cPreserve Middle Class Missouri\u201d push against right-to-work are paid $177,000 each, more than triple the average Missouri household income.\n\nStaff of the Carpenters union behind \u201cThe Committee to Protect MO Families\u201d are paid an average of $94,834, while Missouri carpenters are paid an average of $50,120.\n\nThe gulf between Missouri workers and the union bosses paid with workers\u2019 dues widens when union leaders are compared to inexperienced workers the same way AFL-CIO compares S&P 500 CEOs to entry-level workers.\n\nMissourians who graduated from state colleges with associate degrees in 2012 were paid an average of $42,477 in heavily unionized construction trades last year, according to Missouri Department of Economic Development records.\n\nWorkers with annual wages at the tenth percentile in several major sectors of Missouri\u2019s economy were paid roughly one-tenth as much as the union bosses running Preserve Middle Class Missouri.\n\nBased on federal data, wages at the tenth percentile for sales and related jobs were $16,770 in Missouri last year. Transportation and material moving jobs paid $17,600 at the tenth percentile, while office and administrative support jobs paid $18,940 and production jobs paid $19,000.\n\nUnion bosses typically refuse to comment on their own pay, especially in the midst of campaigns like their fight to sustain Nixon\u2019s right-to-work veto in Missouri. Multiple Teamsters union locals, United Food & Commercial Workers Local 655 and the Missouri AFL-CIO failed to respond to questions from Watchdog.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fans of mandatory union dues say workers shouldn\u2019t mind that union bosses are paid six figures, because executives at huge corporations are paid more.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Fans of mandatory union dues say workers shouldn\u2019t mind that union bosses are paid six figures, because executives at huge corporations are paid more.", "title": "Union bosses benefit from the income inequality they bash - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/09/aflcio-rich-trumka-youtube.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-14T06:21:47+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/237906/union-boss-income-inequality/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Fans of mandatory union dues say workers shouldn\u2019t mind that union bosses are paid six figures, because executives at huge corporations are paid more.", "title": "Union bosses benefit from the income inequality they bash - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/09/aflcio-rich-trumka-youtube.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Labor", "published_time": "2015-09-14T04:00:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-14T06:21:47+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "afl-cio, richard trumka, missouri rtw, right-to-work, right to work, forced unionism, union pay, union boss pay, tim jones"}, "article_summary": "The gulf between Missouri workers and the union bosses paid with workers\u2019 dues widens when union leaders are compared to inexperienced workers the same way AFL-CIO compares S&P 500 CEOs to entry-level workers.\nBut does it make sense to compare union bosses \u2014 whose pay is taken from the workers they claim to represent \u2014 to the CEOs who pay workers\u2019 salaries?\nTrumka, who was paid $322,131, was not even one of the nation\u2019s 100 highest-paid union bosses.\nResponding (here and here, for example) to Watchdog investigations into pay inequality between union leaders and rank-and-file members, union supporters insist workers shouldn\u2019t care that union bosses are paid six figures \u2014 because executives at huge corporations are paid more.\nHe called it hypocritical for union bosses to make a living selling \u201csolidarity\u201d to workers who are forced to pay them."}
