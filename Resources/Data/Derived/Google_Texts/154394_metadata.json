Until recently \u2014 like, say, two weeks ago \u2014 the Department of Defense used the term unlawful combatant as the label for terrorists captured by American military and intelligence forces as a way to distinguish them from uniformed soldiers of a recognized state authority in a straight-up fight. Their new manual dispenses with that term, the Federation of American Scientists noticed today (via Steven Aftergood and Olivier Knox):\n\nWhen it comes to Department of Defense doctrine on military treatment of detained persons, \u201cunlawful enemy combatants\u201d are a thing of the past. That term has been retired and replaced by \u201cunprivileged enemy belligerents\u201d in a new revision of Joint Publication 3-13 on Detainee Operations, dated November 13, 2014.\n\nThe manual even has this helpful chart for readers:\n\nThe only actual mention of the previous term comes in the Summary of Changes on page iii, which notes that the revision \u201c[r]evises terminology, taxonomy, and definitions for unlawful enemy combatant, unprivileged belligerent, detainee, and detainee operations.\u201d There is no particular explanation for why unlawful combatant no longer suffices, or why \u201cunprivileged\u201d makes for a clearer understanding between the categories of legitimate POW and everyone else.\n\nSo what\u2019s going on here? Political correctness run amok, like saying there\u2019s no such thing as an unlawful person? A way to reinforce the idea of \u201cprivilege\u201d? No, not really \u2014 or at least not on the DoD\u2019s behalf. If anyone\u2019s to blame for the blandification of nomenclature \u2026 it\u2019s Congress. The new revision to the DoD manual brings the terminology in line with 10 U.S. Code \u00a7 948a, which provides definitions for detainee policies rewritten by Congress to refine the military-commission process. It provides a very precise definition of the two classes of belligerents:\n\n(6) Privileged belligerent.\u2014 The term \u201cprivileged belligerent\u201d means an individual belonging to one of the eight categories enumerated in Article 4 of the Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War. (7) Unprivileged enemy belligerent.\u2014 The term \u201cunprivileged enemy belligerent\u201d means an individual (other than a privileged belligerent) who\u2014 (A) has engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners;\n\n(B) has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners; or\n\n(C) was a part of al Qaeda at the time of the alleged offense under this chapter.\n\nThis section goes back to the Military Commissions Act of 2006, sponsored by Mitch McConnell, but the new terms were introduced in the 111th Congress in the NDAA for 2009. It passed in October 2009 and was signed a few days later by President Obama. The only contemporaneous discussion of this change I could find in a quick search was by Joanne Mariner at Findlaw, who dismissed it as \u201ccosmetic.\u201d Another change was somewhat more substantial:\n\nThe new law begins by tweaking the definition of individuals eligible for trial before military commissions \u2014 most obviously by scrapping the phrase \u201cunlawful enemy combatant,\u201d and replacing it with \u201cunprivileged enemy belligerent.\u201d This is a cosmetic change, not a real improvement, which mirrors the administration\u2019s decision to drop the enemy combatant formula in habeas litigation at Guantanamo Bay. In addition, the new definition sets out three separate grounds on which a person might be deemed an \u201cunprivileged enemy belligerent,\u201d which vary somewhat from the grounds for eligibility included in the previous definition. The third ground, now separate from the previous two, is membership in Al Qaeda, whether or not the member has engaged in or supported hostilities against the US. (Under the previous definition, membership in \u201cAl Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces\u201d was relevant to the determination of whether a person had engaged in or supported hostilities, but was not itself a distinct ground for eligibility.) Notably, the Taliban is no longer specifically named in the new definition. This suggests, perhaps, that the administration is acknowledging a meaningful difference between the Taliban and Al Qaeda, and wants to leave open, at least for the future, the possibility that the Taliban is not the enemy.\n\nThat might seem a little more notable in the wake of the Bowe Bergdahl swap. It\u2019s possible that this could provide the White House a way to press for the release of more Taliban detainees from Guantanamo Bay, but it would be a tendentious and silly argument. Publicly, the administration has argued that the risk from their release has disappeared by now, which is their main and most effective argument, even if experience has clearly proven it to be untrue \u2014 which we\u2019ve known for years.\n\nAt any rate, the new nomenclature seems pretty silly, and the need to change from unlawful combatant non-existent. Don\u2019t blame the Department of Defense for it, although we can certainly wonder why it took them five years to catch up to the changes (and what may have prompted the recent action). That silliness comes from one of America\u2019s great resources of silliness and meaningless redefinitions of perfectly suitable language \u2014 from your elected officials on Capitol Hill. On the plus side, we can now ask terrorists to check their unprivilege as they enter the detention system, or something.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Check your unprivilege.", "title": "DoD renames \u201cunlawful combatants\u201d in detainee manual to \u2026", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/11/26/dod-renames-unlawful-combatants-in-detainee-manual-to/", "image": {"width": 560, "identifier": "http://media.hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/dod-belligerent.jpg", "height": 376}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@EdMorrissey"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-27T00:01:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-27T15:46:26+00:00"}, "keywords": "Congress, Department of Defense, enemy combatant, Ike Skelton, military commissions, unprivileged enemy combatant,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "At any rate, the new nomenclature seems pretty silly, and the need to change from unlawful combatant non-existent.\nDoD renames \u201cunlawful combatants\u201d in detainee manual to \u2026posted at 7:01 pm on November 26, 2014 by Ed MorrisseyIn fact, captured terrorists went out of style a long time ago, so that\u2019s not the actual change.\nThat term has been retired and replaced by \u201cunprivileged enemy belligerents\u201d in a new revision of Joint Publication 3-13 on Detainee Operations, dated November 13, 2014.\nTheir new manual dispenses with that term, the Federation of American Scientists noticed today (via Steven Aftergood and Olivier Knox):When it comes to Department of Defense doctrine on military treatment of detained persons, \u201cunlawful enemy combatants\u201d are a thing of the past.\nIn addition, the new definition sets out three separate grounds on which a person might be deemed an \u201cunprivileged enemy belligerent,\u201d which vary somewhat from the grounds for eligibility included in the previous definition."}
