My format gives me much less space, but I\u2019m going to try to take up his major points here. Then we can move on, which most of you have probably already done. Ad Policy\n\n1) Illegal abortion. What would happen if the United States made abortion a crime? Experts cite very high rates of unsafe clandestine procedures in parts of the world where abortion is banned, but Douthat dismissed my example of Brazil\u2014where, despite a virtually total ban, the abortion rate is higher than in the United States, and more than 200,000 women end up in the hospital each year\u2014on the grounds that it\u2019s in the developing world. I\u2019m not sure that makes Brazil irrelevant. There are places in the United States where poverty is rampant and healthcare for the poor inadequate\u2014large swaths of Texas and the Deep South, for example.\n\nBut OK, forget Brazil. Douthat likens Ireland\u2014a country with low abortion rates and a ban so strict that women must travel outside the country to end a pregnancy, unless it\u2019s absolutely sure to kill them\u2014to its neighbor, the United Kingdom, where abortion is legal and widely practiced except in North Ireland. Ergo, bans work. But how similar are these nations? The UK is large, industrialized, urban, multiethnic, and one of the most secularized countries in the world, while Ireland is tiny, homogeneous, deeply shaped by a long history of colonialism, poverty, rural traditions, and the pervasive patriarchal power of the Roman Catholic Church. Moreover, as the recent referendum approving same-sex marriage showed, Ireland is changing fast. Its people are wealthier, better educated, and more cosmopolitan; and, as elsewhere, sexual scandals and their cover-ups have weakened the moral authority of the church. The use of contraception is widespread; emergency contraception can be purchased without a prescription; and an unknown but not trivial number of women obtain abortion pills through pro-choice networks. To Douthat, it may look as if the ban works reasonably well, but the Irish don\u2019t seem to think so: Polls show majority support for liberalizing abortion laws, even among Mass-attending farmers. If pro-choice advocates succeed in putting a referendum on the ballot to overturn the constitutional ban on abortion, chances are good that it will pass. I doubt that, in a decade or two from now, Irish women will be risking 14 years in prison for taking a pill that is available online and legal almost everywhere else in Europe.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/pro-choice_protest_abortion_ss_img-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Katha Pollitt", "description": "Ross Douthat, the New York Times columnist and anti-choice conservative Catholic, has responded at some length on his blog (parts one and two) to my postelection column, in which I posed some pointed questions for pro-lifers.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "Ross Douthat, the New York Times columnist and anti-choice conservative Catholic, has responded at some length on his blog (parts one and two) to my postelection column, in which I posed some pointed questions for pro-lifers.", "title": "Illegal Abortion Is Dangerous, Birth Control Works, and Other Inconvenient Truths for Pro-Lifers", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/illegal-abortion-is-dangerous-birth-control-works-and-other-inconvenient-truths-for-pro-lifers/", "image": {"width": 1440, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/pro-choice_protest_abortion_ss_img.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 907}, "updated_time": "2015-09-23T15:19:56+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ross Douthat, the New York Times columnist and anti-choice conservative Catholic, has responded at some length on his blog (parts one and two) to my postelection column, in which I posed some pointed questions for pro-lifers.", "title": "Illegal Abortion Is Dangerous, Birth Control Works, and Other Inconvenient Truths for Pro-Lifers", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/illegal-abortion-is-dangerous-birth-control-works-and-other-inconvenient-truths-for-pro-lifers/", "image": {"height": 907, "src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/pro-choice_protest_abortion_ss_img.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/pro-choice_protest_abortion_ss_img-1440x756.jpg", "width": 1440}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "September 24th, 2015", "sailthru.title": "Illegal Abortion Is Dangerous, Birth Control Works, and Other Inconvenient Truths for Pro-Lifers", "keywords": "column, subject to debate, feminism, gender and sexuality, health and disease, law, reproductive rights, science and health, society", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 187892, "sailthru.tags": "Feminism,Gender and Sexuality,Health and Disease,Law,Reproductive Rights,Science and Health,Society,Column,Subject to Debate", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "society", "published_time": "2015-09-24T09:45:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-23T15:19:56+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/matthew-grace/"}, "sailthru.description": "Ross Douthat thinks abortion could be criminalized without sacrificing women\u2019s equality or well-being.
