Kathleen Sebelius is back, and she has figured out why the Affordable Care Act is so unpopular.\n\nNo, it\u2019s not the law\u2019s imposition of new taxes on those who have health insurance, or the \u201cfines\u201d levied on individuals who are now forced to purchase insurance whether they want it or not. It\u2019s not the limits the law places on access to preferred health care providers. It\u2019s not the fact that millions in the individual market lost the plans with which they were happy with but did not comport with new ACA coverage standards, nor the fact that millions more are set to lose their policies when the law is eventually fully implemented. It\u2019s not the law\u2019s deleterious impact on the labor participation rate, which remains at its lowest point since the Carter administration.\n\nNope. The reason why \u201cObamacare\u201d is so persistently unpopular is the fact that the law bears the name of a president who is also unpopular.\n\n\u201cI think we may need to call it something in the future different, but it is working,\u201d Sebelius said at an event sponsored by Politico. \u201cObamacare, no question, has a very bad brand that has been driven intentionally by a lot of misinformation and a lot of paid advertising.\u201d\n\nMaybe it\u2019s the sudden onset of \u201cGruber syndrome\u201d that prompted Sebelius to suggest the public has been led by the nose by disreputable propagandists and only views the law unfavorably because they lack the cognitive abilities to think for themselves. Maybe the ACA covers that as a preexisting condition.\n\n\u201cNot only are people getting coverage, [but also] the largest drop in uninsured rates in this country, the lowest healthcare cost growth in this country ever recorded,\u201d Sebelius said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s actually doing what it\u2019s supposed to do and creating a competitive market for people who had no choice.\u201d\n\nThis insult to the American public is only compounded by the epistemic closure which prompted it. Sebelius is essentially echoing an embarrassing assertion issued by Vox.com founder Ezra Klein in November. \u201cIn conservative media, ObamaCare is a disaster. In the real world, it\u2019s working,\u201d he wrote. Only outside the intellectually cloistered world in which progressive writers reinforce each other\u2019s biases was this statement not met with hearty guffaws.\n\nGuy Benson performed a lengthy dissection of Klein\u2019s claim and found it wanting.\n\n\u201cObamacare has shattered virtually every major promise its supporters advanced during the public debate of 2009 and 2010,\u201d he wrote.\n\nPremiums are still rising (sharply, in many cases), out-of-pocket costs are increasing, access to care is receding, millions have been unable to retain their preferred plans and physicians (with many more cancellation letters to come), the national health spending trajectory is still pointed upward, the enrollment process is still plagued by technical problems, major components of Obamacare\u2019s less-than-secure website still aren\u2019t built, nonpartisan experts agree that the law is harming the economy, a supermajority of Americans directly impacted by the law thus far say they\u2019ve been hurt by it, and its overall approval rating has languished underwater by double digits for years on end.\n\nThe Federalist\u2019s David Hogberg also issued a response to Klein\u2019s assertion. \u201cDespite what Klein suggests, Obamacare is becoming an even bigger mess,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cApparently, a person can get the most biased view of Obamacare if he pays attention only to liberal websites such as Vox,\u201d Hogberg concluded after detailing 14 methodically researched points which disprove Klein\u2019s, and Sebelius\u2019s, claims.\n\nIt is the height of arrogance for those who have closed themselves off to inconvenient facts to accuse others of engaging in that same practice, but that is the present state of affairs. Sebelius\u2019s dime store political analysis does not even account for the fact that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s favorability rating has remained virtually static since its passage while the president\u2019s job approval has steadily declined \u2013 an association which suggests the health care reform law\u2019s fate is not perfectly linked to the president\u2019s political fortunes.\n\nBut even making this point confers too much legitimacy on Sebelius\u2019s comments that are deserving only of mockery when they are not ignored entirely. Maybe the Democratic Party\u2019s allies should invest a little intellectual energy in determining the real reasons for Obamacare\u2019s unpopularity rather than assuring each other that this majority point of view is illegitimate.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Epistemic closure.", "title": "Sebelius has figured out why Obamacare is unpopular: The \u2018Obama\u2019 part", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/12/10/sebelius-has-figured-out-why-obamacare-is-unpopular-the-obama-part/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "Ezra Klein, Guy Benson, Kathleen Sebelius, ObamaCare,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-10T21:41:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-10T17:55:42+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde421\"", "article_summary": "Sebelius has figured out why Obamacare is unpopular: The \u2018Obama\u2019 partposted at 4:41 pm on December 10, 2014 by Noah RothmanFormer Health and Human Services Sec.\nKathleen Sebelius is back, and she has figured out why the Affordable Care Act is so unpopular.\nThe reason why \u201cObamacare\u201d is so persistently unpopular is the fact that the law bears the name of a president who is also unpopular.\nIt\u2019s not the limits the law places on access to preferred health care providers.\n\u201cObamacare has shattered virtually every major promise its supporters advanced during the public debate of 2009 and 2010,\u201d he wrote."}
