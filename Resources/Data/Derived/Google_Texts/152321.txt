Engineers don't use the term "hurricane-proof" opting instead for '"battleship grade" for the new nuts-and-bolts stuff.

"Hardened" is the word they use in civil engineering circles.

"Stronger" is what regular folks say.

But nobody with a hand in rebuilding New Jersey’s Sandy-bashed infrastructure ever says "hurricane-proof."

"You can only do so much," said Jim Elliott, the construction supervisor at Jenkinson’s Boardwalk in Point Pleasant Beach and Casino Pier in Seaside Heights. "Then you hope it holds."

Hope, fortified with galvanized steel, high-density plastic, thicker concrete, heavier lumber or new technology.

This is the stuff nobody sees. Below the streets or under the boardwalk. Buried deep in the earth or sequestered in a control room.

"Every single town we work for is renewing their investment in the infrastructure, to keep their essential services in operation," said Francis Mullan, a civil engineer and vice president of T&M Associates of Middletown, which is doing about 50 projects in the bayshore alone.

Mullan won’t use the term "hurricane-proof," opting instead for "battleship-grade" for the new nuts-and-bolts stuff.

Storm drainage systems blown out by the Sandy tidal surge are being replaced with thicker pipes or retention basins. Some are made of hard plastics that salt water cannot corrode. Weathered or broken wood bulkheads are being replaced by thicker, impervious vinyl.

Electrical transformers are being "hardened" as Mullan says, encased in watertight metal and put up higher on concrete pedestals.

"This protects them not only from the surge of water, but from being damaged by debris," Mullan said.

The carnival lights and rides on Casino Pier this summer were powered by four large encased generators sitting on solid six-foot high concrete blocks, bringing them to slightly above boardwalk level. Before the storm, they were below street level.

"They’re eight or nine above where they were," Elliott said.

Under the new planks of the boardwalk is a new structure that is using at least twice the lumber of the structure Sandy destroyed.

There are 3,000 new pilings holding up the 101,000-square-foot pier.

They are a heavier grade, wider and spaced more closed together and driven deeper into the ground.

"These are 7½-feet apart," Elliott said. "Some of the old ones were 10 or 12 feet apart, depending on when that piece of the boardwalk was built."

The pilings are just one example of more strength. Every piece of lumber going into the boardwalk is wider and thicker than what it replaced.

Rust-proof galvanized bolts fasten the piles to the sub-flooring, known as the pile cap, and there are now two levels of horizontal, stabilizing boards bolted to the pilings where before there was none. Underneath, the water, gas and electric lines are encased in galvanized steel.

"Would it survive another Sandy? Let’s just say it would have a better chance," Elliott said.

A few miles north, the Lord House Lifeguard Station at one of Toms Rivers’ public beaches is under construction. The old shack was scheduled to be replaced before the storm hit.

All the hurricane did was save the town demolition costs. And those savings were sunk, literarily, into fortifying the new design.

The foundation for the new lifeguard station looks like it could support a train station. There are 12 solid concrete stanchions, each 18-inches-by-18-inches.

Those stanchions are anchored to a two-foot thick concrete cap, which cover concrete-encased pilings that go 25 feet below ground. Some of those are vertical, and others are angled for lateral support

Around the foundation are 8-inch-thick concrete walls. All this will be behind replenished 25-foot dunes. The cost: $1.1 million.

"Pre-Sandy, this might have seemed excessive," said Robert Chankalian, the township engineer. "Post-Sandy, it seems reasonable."

Reasonable, too, are some other technological advances or ideas.

For instance, the next time there is a Sandy, there will be a new "geographic information system" that will show work crews exactly where to locate the shut-off valves for gas lines, without digging through the sand, so that fires that consumed places like Camp Osborn in Brick Township and Breezy Point, Queens, could be controlled.

Call it smarter than the storm.
