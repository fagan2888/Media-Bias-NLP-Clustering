The proposal was radical from the start, write M. Justin Coffey, M.D, and C. Edward Coffey, M.D., who formerly worked at Henry Ford but now are associated with the Menninger Clinic in Houston. Since the initiative redesigns care with perfection in mind, the clinic's goal was zero suicides.\n\nTo achieve this outcome, leaders drew on the Institute of Medicine's 2001 Quality Chasm report, which identifies six features of perfect care: patient-centeredness, safety, timeliness, equity, effectiveness and efficiency. Initially, zero suicides was only the goal under the effectiveness heading, but it soon became the overarching goal for the entire project. This involved a multi-pronged strategy which includes improving care access and removing access to means of suicide. As part of its care redesign, staff dropped the fundamental notion that all mentally ill patients are at risk of suicide and eliminated screenings that wasted valuable time.\n\nThe most important strategy, however, was developing a \"just culture\" that held staff accountable for improvement. Over a decade, the system cut suicide rates by 80 percent, achieving the goal of zero suicides in 2009, the blog post notes. The initiative achieved these outcomes even as the suicide rate increased among non-psychiatric patients and within Michigan's population at large.\n\nThis February, the Joint Commission issued an alert outlining steps all healthcare providers must take to address suicidal patients, including reviewing medical and family histories and evidence-based screening for all patients. A month later a study was released that found emergency physicians often fail to ask suicidal patients about their access to firearms.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the post\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nJoint Commission releases action alert for suicide prevention\n\nER docs don't ask half of suicidal patients about gun access\n\nDallas hospital becomes first to conduct universal suicide-risk screenings\n\nHospitals can play a more active role in suicide prevention\n\nHospital intervention cuts readmissions for patients at risk for delirium, suicide\n\nVA researching natural language processing in EHRs to prevent suicide\n\nArmy applies data to improve suicide prevention\n\nUniversity of Iowa hospitals consider barriers on parking ramps to prevent suicides", "article_metadata": {"description": "A program at Henry Ford Health System's Behavioral Health Services Department drastically reduced suicide rates by applying a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation care redesign initiative to target depression,\u00a0according to\u00a0a case study published on the\u00a0NEJM\u00a0Catalyst\u00a0blog.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "A program at Henry Ford Health System's Behavioral Health Services Department drastically reduced suicide rates by applying a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation care redesign initiative to target depression,\u00a0according to\u00a0a case study published on the\u00a0NEJM\u00a0Catalyst\u00a0blog.", "title": "Henry Ford program slashes patient suicide rates by 80%", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/henry-ford-program-slashes-patient-suicide-rates-80/2016-04-21", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Behavioral Health,henry ford health system,mental health,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Suicide", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "Over a decade, the system cut suicide rates by 80 percent, achieving the goal of zero suicides in 2009, the blog post notes.\nA month later a study was released that found emergency physicians often fail to ask suicidal patients about their access to firearms.\nA program at Henry Ford Health System's Behavioral Health Services Department drastically reduced suicide rates by applying a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) care redesign initiative to target depression, according to a case study published on the NEJM Catalyst blog.\nInitially, zero suicides was only the goal under the effectiveness heading, but it soon became the overarching goal for the entire project.\nSince the initiative redesigns care with perfection in mind, the clinic's goal was zero suicides."}
