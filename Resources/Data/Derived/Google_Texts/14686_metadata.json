Considering that the federal government allotted a whole bunch of cash toward the states that elected to build their own exchanges, these state-exchange screw-ups taken together mean quite a bit of wasted taxpayer money, via Politico:\n\nNearly half a billion dollars in federal money has been spent developing four state Obamacare exchanges that are now in shambles \u2014 and the final price tag for salvaging them may go sharply higher. Each of the states \u2014 Massachusetts, Oregon, Nevada and Maryland \u2014 embraced Obamacare, and each underperformed. All have come under scathing criticism and now face months of uncertainty as they rush to rebuild their systems or transition to the federal exchange. The federal government is caught between writing still more exorbitant checks to give them a second chance at creating viable exchanges of their own or, for a lesser although not inexpensive sum, adding still more states to HealthCare.gov. The federal system is already serving 36 states, far more than originally anticipated.\n\nBesides those four states, Politico notes, Hawaii and Minnesota could soon add their dysfunctional websites to that ignominious scrap heap, which could hike the price up even further \u2014 and that $474 million figure is only the amount that states have already spent and that officials have publicly detailed. As Phil Kerpen argues at The Federalist, that figure is liable to be much higher; although states like Oregon and Massachusetts have yet to run through the entire budget that the federal government so generously allotted to them, they aren\u2019t likely to give the remaining balance of their federal marketplace-building grants back to the national coffers, either. Kerpen calculates that the cost of just Oregon, Massachusetts, and Maryland have already put us back by more like $655 million, and the total amount given away in federal grants is almost a whopping 5 billion smackers.\n\nI know Democrats like to claim that they are totally on board with legislation that sincerely attempts to \u201cfix\u201d what they admit are ObamaCare\u2019s obvious flaws, but we\u2019ll see how they react to this latest offering from Senate Republicans Hatch and Barrasso, via National Journal:\n\nToday, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) joined Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY) to introduce The State Exchange Accountability Act. The bill will force states that wasted hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars on failed Obamacare exchanges to repay the federal government. If a state chooses to no longer operate their own individual exchange, they will have to repay Washington for all of the taxpayer funding they received for their failed exchange. Specifically, the state will have to repay ten percent of their wasted federal grant funding each year over a ten year period. \u201cThe American people are sick and tired of writing a blank check for the health care law\u2019s complete failures. After forcing taxpayers to pay hundreds of millions of dollars for the failed website, the Obama Administration now expects Americans to pay hundreds of millions of dollars for failed state exchanges,\u201d said Barrasso. \u201cEnough is enough. States that scrap their state-run Obamacare exchanges are admitting they\u2019ve wasted millions of dollars in federal grants. It\u2019s only fair that states have to pay American taxpayers and the federal government back for their total incompetence.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m thinking that critics will likely frame this as mere petty squabbling over small potatoes to keep ObamaCare in a bad public light before the midterms, and that Republicans really need to just stop because the law is totally working \u2014 and as Ed already noted this morning, the law actually kind of is working the way it was supposed to\u2026 which is not to be confused with working the way it was advertised.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Kersplat.", "title": "Together, those four failed state ObamaCare exchanges are costing taxpayers at least $474 million", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/05/15/together-those-four-failed-state-obamacare-exchange-are-costing-taxpayers-at-least-474-million/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-15T19:21:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-16T01:28:21+00:00"}, "keywords": "exchanges, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, ObamaCare, Oregon, taxpayers,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "After forcing taxpayers to pay hundreds of millions of dollars for the failed website, the Obama Administration now expects Americans to pay hundreds of millions of dollars for failed state exchanges,\u201d said Barrasso.\nThe bill will force states that wasted hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars on failed Obamacare exchanges to repay the federal government.\nStates that scrap their state-run Obamacare exchanges are admitting they\u2019ve wasted millions of dollars in federal grants.\nAll have come under scathing criticism and now face months of uncertainty as they rush to rebuild their systems or transition to the federal exchange.\nSpecifically, the state will have to repay ten percent of their wasted federal grant funding each year over a ten year period."}
