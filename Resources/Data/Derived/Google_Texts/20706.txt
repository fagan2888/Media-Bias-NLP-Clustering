The Oilers are set to host the Allen Americans Thursday on the day after Christmas, and Tulsa decided to make the game a little more festive.

As you can see in the picture, Tulsa revealed special red-and-green Christmas jerseys covered in Christmas trees, reindeer and other holiday patterns.



The team's official Twitter account tweeted the following Thursday afternoon: "The Christmas jerseys are ready for action! Are you ready for holiday hockey? Oilers vs Americans at 7:05pm #hohoho" and attached the picture.
