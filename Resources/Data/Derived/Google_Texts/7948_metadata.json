Cleveland, a three-day public art lighting project that calls attention to the big changes taking shape in the city\u2019s landscape.\n\n\n\nThe event, produced by LAND studio and supported by Cuyahoga Arts & Culture and Cleveland Public Power, takes place on downtown\u2019s malls and features the dramatic work of international artists. (You can preview their installations here.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s how LAND studio describes what you\u2019ll see:\n\n\n\n\u201dThe artist collective Obscura Digital will use 3D video mapping for this multisensory experience that is sure to amaze and mesmerize audiences.\n\n\n\nWhen you\u2019re not light gazing, you can find sanctuary in Cleveland Public Library\u2019s Eastman Reading Garden and observe artist Iv\u00e1n Ju\u00e1rez\u2019s Drawing Lines, a continuous thread of nearly 15,000 feet of rope that filter natural light and forge new passages and space.\n\n\n\nFinally, as part of the festival of lights, you can take a dip in a figurative pool on the Mall. Jen Lewin\u2019s, The Pool, will create swirling circles of lights and color that people can interact with.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere are free, family-oriented events each night in addition to the installations: Thursday, 8 p.m., PechaKucha Night Cleveland, Volume 23; Friday, 7:30 p.m., Believe in CLE community yoga class; Friday, 8 p.m.: East Meets West Slow Roll Bike Ride.\n\n\n\nFor a sense of what you\u2019ll see, check out this YouTube video:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis and that\n\nBest-laid plans \u2026: Remember high-speed rail? And how it was going to be a big focus of the Obama administration?\n\n\n\nHasn\u2019t really worked out.\n\n\n\n\u201cDespite the administration spending nearly $11 billion since 2009 to develop faster passenger trains, the projects have gone mostly nowhere and the United States still lags far behind Europe and China,\u201d The New York Times reports.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile Republican opposition and community protests have slowed the projects here, transportation policy experts and members of both parties also place blame for the failures on missteps by the Obama administration \u2014 which in July asked Congress for nearly $10 billion more for high-speed initiatives,\u201d the paper says.\n\n\n\nA major bump in the road to high-speed rail came when Florida, Ohio and Wisconsin, all led by Republican governors, \u201ccanceled high-speed rail projects and returned federal funds after deeming the projects too expensive and unnecessary,\u201d the newspaper reports.\n\n\n\nHowever, \u201cThe Obama administration\u2019s management of previously appropriated high-speed rail funding has been as clumsy as its superintending of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s rollout,\u201d says Frank N. Wilner, a former chief of staff at the Surface Transportation Board, a bipartisan body with oversight of the nation\u2019s railroads.\n\n\n\nInstead of putting the $11 billion directly into those projects, critics say, \u201cthe administration made the mistake of parceling out the money to upgrade existing Amtrak service, which will allow trains to go no faster than 110 miles per hour,\u201d according to The Times. \u201cNone of the money originally went to service in the Northeast Corridor, the most likely place for high-speed rail.\u201d\n\n\n\nFingers crossed: With any luck, this will be out of date soon.\n\n\n\nForbes.com runs its annual list of America\u2019s Most Miserable Sports Cities, and of course, Cleveland is on it. We\u2019re No 3, though, behind Atlanta and Phoenix, which both have seen sports teams win championships more recently than the Browns, Cavaliers or Indians.\n\n\n\nHow does that work? From Forbes.com\u2019s explanation:\n\n\n\n\u201dWe grade the misery of major sports cities (only those with 75 cumulative years in the NFL, NBA, Major League Baseball and the NHL are considered) based not so much on sheer futility as the \u201cletdown factor.\u201d That is, which teams have been good enough to build up fans\u2019 hopes only to fall short of the brass ring in the end. Those that probably pop into your mind right away: the Braves (19 postseasons; one championship), the Phoenix Suns (eight trips to at least the Western Conference Finals, no championships), and the Buffalo Bills (one AFL championship in the pre-merger days, then 0-for-4 in Super Bowls). All three of those cities make our top five.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCome 2015, perhaps with the LeBron/Kyrie/KLove-led Cavaliers, this all will be moot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few of her favorite things: Cleveland native and arts patron Agnes Gund shares some of the things she likes best in this short feature in WSJ magazine.\n\n\n\nAmong them: a colorful photo of dogs shot by William Wegman; peppermint-stick flavor ice cream from Graeter\u2019s in Cincinnati, an animal sculpture made by a student at P.S. 139, in Brooklyn, as part of the Studio in a School program; and two books, \u201cThe Rise by Sarah Lewis\u201d and \u201cLetters from London.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe also has a big-time love of flowers.\n\n\n\n\u201cI always have them around me,\u201d Gund says. The feature includes a picture that has flowers from Ronaldo Maia, \u201cwho has a real artist's eye,\u201d she notes. \u201cI love peonies and also lilies of the valley, because they were my father's favorite.\" Her father was George Gund II, president and board chair of the Cleveland Trust Co.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou also can follow me on Twitter for more news about business and Northeast Ohio.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "The public art lighting project will take place on downtown's malls and feature the work of international artists.
