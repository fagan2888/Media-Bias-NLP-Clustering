A man charged with killing his uncle is set to go on trial in October.

The Manhattan Mercury reports that Christopher Michael Arand initially planned to enter a plea during a hearing Thursday in Pottawatomie County District Court. But defense attorney Richard Lake says Arand changed his mind and decided he wanted a trial.

Arand is charged with first-degree murder in the death of 70-year-old Larry Arand, who was found dead in his Belvue home in November. He also is charged with felony cruelty to animals in the death of his uncle's cat.
