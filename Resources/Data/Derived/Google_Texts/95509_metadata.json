Seven supported creating a Laura\u2019s Law program for Ventura County. Other members who abstained work for the Behavioral Health Department, including Janis Gardner, who chairs the Behavioral Health Advisory Board and ran the working group meeting.\n\nLaura\u2019s Law was passed in 2002 and has been implemented by a handful of California counties, including Los Angeles. It was named for Laura Wilcox, a 19-year-old mental health worker in Nevada County who was killed in 2001 by a man who had turned down psychiatric treatment.\n\nThe law allows judges to order outpatient treatment for mentally ill people who have refused treatment, are \u201csubstantially deteriorating\u201d in their conditions, and have a history of involuntary hospitalizations or violent acts. People who are considered dangerous to themselves or others can already be committed for up to 72 hours without their consent, but before Laura\u2019s Law, there was no way to force treatment beyond that.\n\nLaura\u2019s Law has no penalties for noncompliance. Still, mental health professionals say it has been effective in pushing people into treatment.\n\nIn Ventura County, the program would be run by the county Behavioral Health Department and cost about $2.2 million per year\n\nThe working group\u2019s previous chairman, Dave Holmboe, died on May 17. His health problems led to postponing a vote on the issue that had been scheduled for late April. Holmboe was regarded as a county leader in advocating for mental health services.\n\nOn Wednesday, 10 people, including many parents of mentally ill people, spoke in support of Laura\u2019s Law. Ventura Mayor Cheryl Heitmann volunteered her city as the host of a pilot program, if the Board of Supervisors chooses not to implement the law countywide.\n\n\u201cOur contention is that allowing mentally ill and or psychotic individuals to live in a homeless situation due to lack of treatment is simply irresponsible,\u201d Heitmann said. \u201cThe lack of treatment for these people results in jails and hospitals becoming de facto psychiatric centers, staffed by people who are not trained or equipped for that.\u201d\n\nThree working group members who voted against Laura\u2019s Law instead supported a new program with mental health professionals available 24 hours a day to enroll anyone in the county in voluntary treatment.\n\nIf Laura\u2019s Law is implemented, the voluntary treatment program also will be available; state law mandates that the court-ordered treatment under Laura\u2019s Law be the same as what\u2019s given to people who sign up voluntarily.\n\nRod Kodman, Ventura County\u2019s chief deputy public defender, said he voted against Laura\u2019s Law because public defenders, like all attorneys, are duty-bound to represent their clients\u2019 interests. If a mentally ill client does not want to enter treatment, Kodman said, his or her attorney must respect that decision and fight on the client\u2019s behalf.\n\n\u201cWe believe that there must be more help for those that suffer from mental illness in our community, but we cannot support any program that is adversarial to our clients,\u201d he said.\n\nBefore the vote, Elaine Crandall, director of the Ventura County Behavioral Health Department, gave a presentation on how Laura\u2019s Law would be administered and what it might cost.\n\nBased on the demand for services in counties that have already implemented the law, she predicted a caseload of 34 people per year undergoing court-ordered treatment, with another 75 who would enroll in voluntary treatment rather than go before a judge.\n\nTreating those people would require 14 staff members, as well as part-time help from nurses and doctors. The total cost would be about $2.2 million per year. A strictly voluntary program would treat about 20 people, at a cost of about $500,000 per year, Crandall said.\n\nCrandall did not factor in court costs from Laura\u2019s Law hearings, or the savings that might result from having fewer mentally ill people in jails or emergency rooms. The law is so new, she said, that there isn\u2019t reliable data on what those long-term effects might be.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Committee recommends the county adopt Laura's Law", "og": {"url": "http://www.vcstar.com/news/local/county/committee-recommends-the-county-adopt-lauras-law-ep-1107250414-343808902.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/countyseal_18911395_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 480}, "type": "article", "description": "After 10 months of study and deliberation, a special committee voted Wednesday to recommend that Ventura County adopt Laura\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law, which would allow for involuntary outpatient treatment for mentally ill people.", "title": "Committee recommends the county adopt Laura's Law"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/countyseal_18911395_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "After 10 months of study and deliberation, a special committee voted Wednesday to recommend that Ventura County adopt Laura\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law, which would allow for involuntary outpatient treatment for mentally ill people.", "site": "https://twitter.com/vcstar", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Committee recommends the county adopt Laura's Law"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-vcs-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0fd8\"", "article_summary": "If Laura\u2019s Law is implemented, the voluntary treatment program also will be available; state law mandates that the court-ordered treatment under Laura\u2019s Law be the same as what\u2019s given to people who sign up voluntarily.\nSeven supported creating a Laura\u2019s Law program for Ventura County.\nLaura\u2019s Law was passed in 2002 and has been implemented by a handful of California counties, including Los Angeles.\n<p>CONTRIBUTED PHOTO</p>By Tony BiasottiAfter 10 months of study and deliberation, a special committee voted Wednesday to recommend that Ventura County adopt Laura\u2019s Law, which would allow for involuntary outpatient treatment for mentally ill people.\nOn Wednesday, 10 people, including many parents of mentally ill people, spoke in support of Laura\u2019s Law."}
