But could one imagine a world where hospitals reached out to people in their communities to address the deeply rooted social and environmental factors impacting health? While not widespread, this phenomenon is already in play at some hospitals in New York State and across the country.\n\nGuided by growing evidence that most of one\u2019s health can be attributed to non-medical determinants such as social, behavioral, and environmental factors, some hospitals are taking a broad population health stance. They are defining their target population to include not only their patients but also everyone in their geographic communities, and broadening their scope of action to include impacting non-medical determinants of health.\n\nThrough close collaboration with community and government organizations, these hospitals have been successful\u2014even with relatively small financial investments\u2014in creating programs to improve such things as access to housing, availability of healthy food, and improved education in their communities.\n\nAt present, these hospitals are exceptions to the norm. In the future, could more hospitals have the incentives and capabilities to develop sustainable programs that address non-medical determinants of population health in their communities?\n\nThe Case For Hospitals To Engage In Community Health\n\nIncentives for hospitals to invest in community health improvement are increasing. Nationally, the growth of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) and of value-based, risk sharing contracts that make hospitals partly responsible for total patient costs give hospitals an incentive to improve socioeconomic factors that impact the health of people in their community. This is especially true of hospitals with large regional market shares.\n\nIn addition, the Accountable Health Communities program recently introduced by the Innovation Center of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) will invest $157 million to evaluate whether engaging hospitals and other organizations in targeting social determinants of health will reduce health care utilization and costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.\n\nFinally, non-profit hospitals, which receive an estimated $24.6 billion in tax benefits yearly, are required to conduct periodic community health needs assessments and to report their yearly spending on community benefit activities to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Traditionally, most of the reported community benefits involve charity care and unreimbursed patient expenses, but recently the IRS has begun to encourage hospitals to report \u201ccommunity building\u201d activities that affect social determinants of health.\n\nSome states, such as New York, have also initiated programs encouraging collaboration between hospitals and community organizations to improve population health. For example, the New York State Health Improvement Plan mandates that hospitals and local health departments collaborate to create community service plans tackling health and health disparities. The state\u2019s Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (DSRIP) Program will reinvest up to $6.42 billion dollars of Medicaid Redesign Team savings into programs where health care providers and community organizations collaborate to reduce preventable hospitalizations, in part through population health initiatives aimed at multiple health determinants.\n\nWho Is Engaging In Community Population Health, And How Are They Doing It?\n\nWe interviewed leaders at 24 hospitals (18 in New York State and six nationally) and leaders of community organizations working with these hospitals, and found that hospitals\u2019 decisions about whether to engage in community health improvement is idiosyncratic. Participating hospitals covered the spectrum, including hospitals of larger or smaller size, urban or rural location, and public or private governance.\n\nLeadership\u2014especially at the CEO level\u2014that is committed to tackling root causes of health is one of the most important factors. Some leaders are willing to take the risk of investing in programs that are not reimbursable under fee-for service because they believe these programs will lead to cost savings in the emerging value-based payment world \u2014 and that the programs are the right thing to do.\n\nAs noted, hospitals with a large market share in their communities are often interested in improving the non-medical determinants of health, especially if they are located in disadvantaged communities. Hospitals with a deeply rooted community service mission, through philosophical orientation and/or longstanding community ties, also appear more likely to try to improve community health.\n\nExamples of innovative programs that hospitals have implemented include:\n\nImproving the built environment of neighborhoods by creating safe parks and revitalizing crime-ridden, abandoned lots;\n\nAssisting local residents in completing their GED and getting jobs;\n\nDeveloping local regulations to establish smoke-free public areas;\n\nCreating access to healthy foods and produce through community gardens and grocery store partnerships; and,\n\nProviding safe and affordable low-income housing.\n\nResources To Support Community Investment\n\nMany of the hospital leaders we interviewed felt that lack of financial resources was a significant barrier to engaging in community health improvement. They noted lack of both fee-for-service payment and upfront funding for technology and staffing infrastructure. Nevertheless, some hospitals were able to create such programs with relatively small financial investments, using a number of mechanisms.\n\nFirst, it was imperative that hospitals develop strong partnerships with community organizations so they would not need to \u201creinvent the wheel\u201d in learning the lay of the land, developing community trust, and building infrastructure. For example, hospitals partnered with schools and grocery stores to improve access to healthy foods, and with community housing organizations to create access to affordable and safe housing. Hospitals also worked with community organizations with expertise in embedding themselves directly into hospitals\u2019 practices \u2014 such as organizations providing on-site legal services to help patients remediate substandard housing conditions or obtain health insurance coverage.\n\nSecond, funding opportunities such as New York\u2019s DSRIP initiative can help finance these programs. Additionally, DRSIP may enable hospitals to build infrastructure for measurement of health and cost improvements from tackling community-level non-medical health determinants to show return on investment, not only to Medicaid but to payers across the board. To further assess return on investment, some hospitals are enhancing their electronic health records to track social factors and are seeking ways to share such data with community organizations and public health departments.\n\nLooking Forward\n\nThough hospitals\u2019 core mission is to provide medical care, venturing into the uncharted waters of community non-medical health determinants is a challenging, but not impossible, task. Community organizations, foundations, and government agencies providing examples of how hospitals can feasibly engage in this work will promote further hospital participation.\n\nHospitals can have influence through their roles as respected organizations and large employers within their communities. They can use their leadership expertise, as well as limited investment of financial resources, to act as catalysts, working with community organizations and public health departments to improve the health of their communities. This\u2014not simply providing better medical care for the population of ACO patients \u201cattributed\u201d to a hospital\u2014is population health.\n\nAuthors\u2019 Note\n\nOur study was funded by a grant from the New York State Health Foundation.
