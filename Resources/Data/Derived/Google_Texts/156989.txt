New Hampshire’s Medicaid expansion program finally has a launch date. Coverage for an estimated 50,000 low-income recipients will start August 15, with an enrollment period beginning July 1.

“The bipartisan New Hampshire Health Protection Program is a historic step forward for the health and economic well-being of New Hampshire families, businesses and communities,” writes Governor Maggie Hassan in a statement announcing the new timeline.

Residents earning up to 138% of the federal poverty level, or about $16,000 a year, are eligible for the program.

Applicants who already have insurance through their employers will remain on that plan if the state determines it to be cost-effective. All other recipients will select a Medicaid managed care plan.

In 2016, all newly eligible Medicaid recipients will transition into the health insurance exchange, where they will be able to select from private health plans.

New Hampshire became the 26th state to expand its Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act when lawmakers approved a bi-partisan deal in March.
