But then, shit.\u201d\n\nAMMAN, Jordan \u2014 I met Abdullah al-Mazouni in early September, a few weeks after moving to Jordan. The first time I ran into him, he was standing before a crowded classroom of Sudanese refugees in East Amman, teaching them English and explaining the silent \u201cE\u201d in flawless colloquial Arabic. He looked young and I assumed he was like me, fresh out of university, volunteering with refugees to improve his Arabic and learn about the Middle East. \u201cYour accent is amazing!\u201d I said, impressed. Abdullah laughed. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m Syrian.\u201d \u201cIn 2011, I was going out with my friends, studying finance, going to work in a bank. But then, shit.\u201d Later, as we took the bus together, he told me his story. Abdullah (some names in this article have been changed to protect people\u2019s identities) is 22 years old, born and raised in Damascus, where he was studying finance when the Syrian uprising began in 2011. He used to work part time at an Italian menswear store, sweet-talking rich Syrians into buying expensive suits. \u201cI have a lot of charm in Arabic,\u201d he says, smiling. Then the revolution broke out. Abdullah fled with his parents and sisters in August 2012 to Jordan, where he works for a news site focused on the Syrian crisis. He has family abroad but can\u2019t leave for school there, because his transcripts are in Damascus. So he stays here, writing reports, tweeting all things Syria, saving money for the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), and scouring the Internet for scholarships abroad.\n\n\u201cIn 2011, I was going out with my friends, studying finance, going to work in a bank. But then, shit.\u201d Abdullah laughs once, then is quiet. \u201cIt\u2019s OK. It\u2019s good experience. I know how to scramble to live, alhamdullilah (praise be to God), you know? Syrians are like that. Bashar hits us with chemical weapons and all the kids die and we\u2019re like, \u2018alhamdullilah.\u2019\u201d I have nothing to say. What makes an American a millennial? A 20-something from Generation Y, narcissistic and privileged, raised on a diet of Facebook and Instagram, ambitious, image-conscious, convinced that we can be whoever and do whatever we want to, and that anything less than that is some freak accident of circumstance or will. What makes a Syrian a millennial? A 20-something caught up in his country\u2019s sudden whirl into hell, victimized at the prime of his life, forced to live in a world that watches his people burn and leaves him powerless to do anything about it. What happens when you put us together? At a holiday party a few months after meeting Abdullah, I\u2019m sipping eggnog and sangria with the millennials of Amman. We\u2019re a motley crew of Fulbright grantees, Arabic students, NGO interns, and journalist wannabes, mixed with Syrian and Jordanian language partners, roommates, and friends. \u201cI don\u2019t Skype them every day. I don\u2019t like hearing my mother cry. But I call, because I might not hear her again.\u201d The Americans banter about Ohio versus New York, making fun of each other\u2019s accents and football teams. We talk about plans for next year, the uncertain job market, and why our internships are awful. Our millennial selves are quick to self-doubt; we want to prove ourselves and attain the next stamp of affirmation even as we name-drop degrees, Arabic programs, and thesis advisors. A few minutes later, I\u2019m sitting on the floor with Mohammad Rumman, also 22 years old and Syrian. He ran across the Syrian-Jordanian border last year, dropping to his stomach to crawl every few meters. \u201cThey shoot at you until you get into Jordan. Then you go to Zaatari,\u201d Mohammad tells me, referring to what is now the world\u2019s second-largest refugee camp. Syrians can\u2019t leave the camp without a Jordanian sponsor submitting a legal guarantee to bail them out. So, after four days, Mohammad climbed a fence at the camp, asked for directions to Amman, and started walking the 45 miles to the Jordanian capital.\n\nWhen he arrived in Amman, Mohammad knew no one. He spent months working at a bakery, sleeping on the floor of the shop, before getting a journalism job that allows him to scrape enough together for rent. His family is still in Damascus. \u201cI don\u2019t Skype them every day. I don\u2019t like hearing my mother cry,\u201d Mohammad shrugs, adjusting his beanie and grinning through his mustache. \u201cBut I call, because I might not hear her again.\u201d Then Macklemore starts pounding in the background. \u201c\u2018Thrift Shop,\u2019 shit, I love this song!\u201d he shouts. Conversation stops. We get up, join the crowd, and dance. My Syrian friends speak of their country like its very name tastes of honey and fire. They teach me songs that damn Assad\u2019s soul. Americans here often apologize, embarrassed, for our country. \u201cThe State Department gave me a scholarship, but that doesn\u2019t mean I support everything it does!\u201d We make deprecating comments about the government shutdown, Kerry\u2019s \u201cpeace process,\u201d and Tequila Tuesdays, when a local bar offering $2 shots draws a hundreds-strong study abroad crowd. \u201c\u2018Murrika\u2019s finest,\u201d we laugh, sheepishly. My Syrian friends speak of their country like its very name tastes of honey and fire. They teach me songs that damn Assad\u2019s soul in one stanza and cry, \u201cSyria, my country, paradise\u201d in the next. \u201cJordan is nothing like Syria,\u201d Mahmoud al-Brinie, a 27-year-old Syrian refugee, says as we walk down Amman\u2019s neon-lit Rainbow Street. He paints his Syrian hometown of Homs in lilting words, telling me of the water wheels, the morning tea and bread with za\u2019atar, the Khalid ibn al-Walid Mosque. \u201cDon\u2019t Google it now,\u201d Mahmoud warns. \u201cYou\u2019ll cry.\u201d No one remembers Syria, Mahmoud tells me, because the world is driven by money, not heart. \u201cEverything is economics,\u201d he says. \u201cInterests outweigh ideals.\u201d I recognize Mahmoud\u2019s point. I heard it a year ago, while debating realism and liberalism in my international relations class at Princeton University. We\u2019d discussed the world like proprietors, tossing around theories as if we could decide which ones applied on a whim. We talked about Syria back then too, impersonating secretaries of defense and state and treasury, invoking statistics on the number of killed and displaced Syrians as part of our debate for or against intervention. Then class would end and we\u2019d walk down the street to complain about our theses over drinks.\n\nSyria is not so easy to forget here. The civil war crops up in every corner. When Abdullah asks me to help him practice his IELTS interview, I prepare an extemporaneous prompt: You\u2019re having lunch tomorrow with any two people in all of humanity, one from history, already passed away, and one alive today. Who would you choose and why? He paints his Syrian hometown of Homs in lilting words.\u201cDon\u2019t Google it now,\u201d Mahmoud warns. \u201cYou\u2019ll cry.\u201d Abdullah has been preparing for the interview for weeks. He scribbles for a minute and then clears his throat. \u201cFirst, I would choose my friend Anas, who was killed during our revolution in Syria. He was a brave and ambitious person who don\u2019t deserve to die. He should really be in the young Syrians\u2019 generation. Syria needs those kinds of people now.\u201d I break eye contact. Abdullah continues. \u201cThe other would be my brother, who\u2019s not in Jordan. For sure we would talk about the war, but also about how we used to go to college and grew up together. I would love to go out with these two together, even if it\u2019s impossible.\u201d I\u2019ve forgotten what I\u2019m supposed to do. Abdullah raises his eyebrows. \u201cAny grammar mistakes?\u201d \u201cOh, right. Um. You said \u2018don\u2019t deserve to die,\u2019 but it should have been \u2018doesn\u2019t,\u2019 or I mean, \u2018didn\u2019t\u2019\u2026\u201d I swallow. \u201cThat\u2019s all. Your English is great. You\u2019ll be fine.\u201d All my Syrian friends give the same answer when I ask what they hope for: first, that the war will end; and second, that they\u2019ll manage to complete their educations. Moutasem al-Homsi, 26, sells street-side coffee from a stall I pass every day. He left Damascus, where he\u2019d been studying English literature, just one class short of finishing his degree. The missing course? Phonology. \u201cIf I found that course somewhere for free, maybe I could get the diploma,\u201d Moutasem says, emptying a frothy stream of Turkish coffee into a cup. He once wanted to be a translator of classical literature, bringing Umayyad and Abbasid stories to the English-speaking world. But tuition at Jordanian universities costs thousands of dollars, a joke to Moutasem, who works from 6:30 a.m. until night every day to house and feed his parents and siblings, who are also in Amman but can\u2019t work. He hides when the Jordanian police come by his stall to avoid arrest for working illegally\u2014the only way most Syrian refugees survive, since work permits are almost impossible to obtain. \u201cOh, right. Um. You said \u2018don\u2019t deserve to die,\u2019 but it should have been \u2018doesn\u2019t,\u2019 or I mean, \u2018didn\u2019t\u2019\u2026\u201d I swallow. Mohammad is one step behind Moutasem. He completed high school but doesn\u2019t have written certification to prove it. So if he wants to study in the West, where some American and European colleges are offering scholarships for Syrians, he\u2019ll have to prove his capabilities on the SAT.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cIn 2011, I was going out with my friends, studying finance, going to work in a bank.
