Elle magazine hailed the speech as the first feminist State of the Union, rejoicing that Obama took women\u2019s issues out of the \u201cghetto\u201d and into the more serious category of economics.\n\nEven his proposal to make community college free counted as a win for feminists, according to The Feminist Majority Foundation, since a majority of college students are women. \u201cPresident Obama placed an unprecedented emphasis on the central role women play in the economy,\u201d the foundation said in a statement praising the speech Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d Schaeffer told The Daily Caller News Foundation. \u201cThey are defining this as a \u2018feminist\u2019 speech because he laid out a menu of \u2018free\u2019 benefits for working women.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we have a wage gap? Yes, a small one that is not the result of widespread discrimination but of women\u2019s and men\u2019s choices,\u201d she continued. \u201cDo we have a shortage of paid leave? Sort of. More than 80 percent of full-time workers have access to some paid leave, and 20 percent of part-time workers.\u201d\n\nObama wants to guarantee every worker seven days of paid sick leave, and grant government workers a full six weeks of paid parental leave. America is behind the times, Obama said Tuesday, because it\u2019s the only advanced country that does not guarantee paid sick days and maternity leave.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d he told Congress Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nAlthough all workers are guaranteed sick days and maternity leave by law, they are not necessarily paid. In the private sector, 43 million Americans do not currently have access to paid sick days, according to the White House.\n\nSchaeffer argued the added cost to business of a one size fits all requirement will force some to cut wages, reduce hours and layoff workers \u2014 actually hurting some women. \u201cToo often the president and Democrats make mountains out of mole hills when it comes to challenges that face women,\u201d she told TheDCNF.\n\nA real \u201cfeminist\u201d State of the Union would be one that gives women more opportunity across the board and more financial freedom, including rolling back Obamacare, rolling back burdensome EPA regulations, embracing energy exploration, keeping the Internet free of government regulations and allowing women to keep more of their own money, she said.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to women, the president and Democrats recognize that women \u2014 especially unmarried women \u2014 are an extremely valuable voting bloc,\u201d Schaeffer told TheDCNF. \u201cBut the underdog message tells women that life in America is inherently unfair.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president, in effect, tells women that we are failing because the game is rigged,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd he paints a picture of society in which women are the perpetual victims of misogynist forces and predatory men. And that\u2019s not only wrong, it\u2019s terrible leadership.\u201d\n\nFollow Rachel on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
