You know those Planet Aid clothing donation boxes you see on the side of the road? Those clothes and over $130 million in U.S. grant money are supposed to help people in southern Africa.

But when Reveal went to Malawi to find out what actually happened, people told us that some of the projects didn’t pan out.

Our investigation finds that the U.S. government knew an international fugitive was linked to the projects, but kept the money flowing. Reveal goes behind the bin and across an ocean to find out what’s going on.
