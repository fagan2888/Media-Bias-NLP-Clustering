The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published the final rules last week just before the Thanksgiving holiday, arguing the rules are \u201can important step for public health.\u201d\n\nDan Goldbeck, a research analyst for the American Action Forum, documented that the rules are more costly than the administration originally anticipated, after expanding the number of restaurants and vending machine owners who must comply.\n\n\u201cThese rules have always been a curious addition to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), as there\u2019s no clear linkage to the law\u2019s primary goal of health insurance reform,\u201d Goldbeck wrote. \u201cOriginally proposed in April 2011, the final versions have taken more than three years to find their way to the Federal Register.\u201d\n\nThe final rules increased costs by $542 million from the proposed rules, totaling $531.1 million for vending machines, and $1.2 billion for restaurants to change their menus. In addition, paperwork associated with the vending machine rule will take 1,507,788.5 hours to complete.\n\nCosts are likely to be passed onto consumers, but the FDA believes Americans will be happy to pay more for additional nutrition information.\n\n\u201cWe fully expect that some proportion of the costs imposed by the regulation will be passed on to consumers, who are generally willing to accept some degree of price increase in exchange for an increase in the nutrient content information of standard menu items,\u201d the FDA said in their Regulatory Impact Analysis on the menu rule in November.\n\nThe rules will apply to vending machine owners who operate at least 20 machines, and restaurant chains with 20 or more locations. An estimated 5.98 million vending machines, and 298,600 restaurants will be affected.\n\nGoldbeck noted that restaurants and vending machines that do not properly label calorie counts could face a $1,000 fine due to \u201cmisbranding.\u201d\n\nThe restaurant rule, which goes into effect December 2015, gets into lengthy detail about what foods must be labeled. For instance, the FDA concluded that the rules will apply to a \u201cpumpkin spice muffin available only in November,\u201d but not to crushed dried peppers, which are \u201cconsidered a condiment that is exempt.\u201d\n\nAll standard menu items must have the number of \u201cCalories\u201d or \u201cCal\u201d listed on every menu boards and menu, and a \u201csuccinct statement\u201d on calories at the bottom of every menu page.\n\nThe FDA settled on the statement, \u201c2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice, but calorie needs vary,\u201d abiding by their principle that the \u201csuccinct statement should be succinct.\u201d\n\nThe government said the rule is flexible because it orders what size and where the calories must be displayed but \u201cdoes not restrict the font style.\u201d\n\nThe FDA also allows restaurant owners to decide whether they want to use a comma for food items of 1,000 calories or more.\n\nFor fast food chains, the FDA even went into how a company will note calories for soft drinks depending on whether they have a \u201cstandard ice fill\u201d for cups.\n\n\u201cIf the covered establishment usually prepares and offers for sale a beverage using a standard beverage fill or dispenses a standard ice fill, the covered establishment must declare calories based on such standard beverage fill or standard ice fill,\u201d the final rule concluded.\n\nThough initially exempt in the proposed rule, alcoholic beverages and condiments will have to have calories listed, unless the condiments are behind the counter.\n\nThe vending machine rule, which takes effect December 2016, is equally complex.\n\nOwners are not allowed to display a single calorie range for items that can be customized. For instance, coffee machines must display calories for every type of combination, for options \u201cskim milk, whole milk, cream, sugar, or sugar substitute.\u201d Slushie machines will have to display calorie counts for \u201ceach variety or flavor.\u201d\n\nFor machines that sell sandwiches, calories will have to include condiments if the packet comes with the sandwich, but not if condiments are stocked outside of the machine in a common area.\n\nThere was also a dispute over whether the rule should apply to only vending machines that have selection buttons, and bureaucrats struggled with a lack of congressional opinion, since the government only recently began regulating vending machines.\n\n\u201cThe term \u2018vending machine\u2019 as used in section 403(q)(5)(H)(viii) is not specific as to whether it must have a selection button,\u201d the final rule said. \u201cThe scant legislative history does not shed any light on whether Congress intended to limit covered vending machines only to those with selection buttons by virtue of the statutory provision regarding the placement of the calorie declaration sign in close proximity to the selection button.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the government decided that the rule would apply to \u201cany machine regardless of whether it has a selection button.\u201d\n\nThe FDA decided that the rule would not apply to \u201cgame machines\u201d that dispense candy, despite objections from one concerned commenter.\n\n\u201cThe comment claimed that a consumer playing a claw game could still maneuver the claw toward a healthier option if the calorie declarations for food prizes were available,\u201d the final rule said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Feds release final rules for vending machines and restaurants", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The federal government formally completed regulations that will force vending machines and restaurants to display calorie information, which can lead to businesses being fined thousands of dollars for", "title": "Obamacare Calorie Posting Regulations to Cost Industry $1.7 Billion", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/obamacare-calorie-posting-regulations-to-cost-industry-1-7-billion/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/vending-machine-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The federal government formally completed regulations that will force vending machines and restauran", "creator": "@LizWFB", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/vending-machine-150x150.jpg", "title": "Obamacare Calorie Posting Regulations to Cost Industry $1.7 Billion", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The regulations, which originated in Obamacare, total 319 pages and will cost industry $1.7 billion to comply.\nIn addition, paperwork associated with the vending machine rule will take 1,507,788.5 hours to complete.\nThe vending machine rule, which takes effect December 2016, is equally complex.\nAn estimated 5.98 million vending machines, and 298,600 restaurants will be affected.\n\u201cThe term \u2018vending machine\u2019 as used in section 403(q)(5)(H)(viii) is not specific as to whether it must have a selection button,\u201d the final rule said."}
