Construction on Sunset Street Bridge is set to begin Monday and while it has been open to pedestrians and cyclists for the past year, they will now need to detour while crews work on replacing the structure.

On Monday, pedestrians and cyclists will need to detour via the St. Vrain Greenway to the Boston Avenue underpass. Access to the businesses on either side of the bridge and to Izaak Walton Park will be maintained throughout construction, according to a city news release.

The bridge was damaged in the September 2013 flood and the city has been working with Boulder County, the Federal Highway Administration and the Colorado Department of Transportation ever since. The goal is to replace it with a bigger bridge that should be able to withstand 100-year flood flows.

The bridge has been closed to vehicles since the flood because the waters damaged the support system, making it unsafe for cars and trucks.

City officials have said that the joint decision between Longmont and Boulder County to completely replace the older bridge instead of repair it at a higher cost, as well as working within the constraints of state and federal grant requirements is why the bridge construction has taken until 2015 to begin.

The bridge replacement is set to be complete in May 2016. The $3.4 million contract was awarded to Broomfield-based Flatiron Construction. The Federal Highway Administration will pay for roughly 83 percent of the cost, while the county and the state will split 9 percent and the city will take on 8 percent of the cost.
