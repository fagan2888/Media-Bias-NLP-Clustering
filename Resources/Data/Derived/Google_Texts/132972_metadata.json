The late James Brown, the Godfather of Soul, put best in song, \u201cIt\u2019s a Man\u2019s, Man\u2019s, Man\u2019s World.\u201d\n\nPatriarchy assumes that men are made to lead and women are simply cooperative and reproductive subordinates.\n\nThese assumptions come to light in all kinds of ways, but especially through religion \u2014 the various faiths that treat women as though they are not equal to men.\n\nWe read it in the Quran and the Bible. We see it in iconic imagery, and religious taboos about sexuality, particularly women\u2019s sexuality. And we see that around the world these days, from Salt Lake City to Sudan.\n\nMen continue to dominate religious institutions, and use them to judge whether women can be in religious leadership or change faiths.\n\nThere is a direct link between Kate Kelly, a lifelong member of the Church of Jesus Christ Latter day-Saints, who was excommunicated on charges of apostasy, and Meriam Ibrahim, a Sudanese woman sentenced to death for her supposed apostasy.\n\nAnd the link is deeper than the charge of abandoning one's faith.\n\nPatriarchy comes in all forms, but religious patriarchy seems particularly pernicious because it assumes that male rule is constituent of God or the gods.\n\nIn other words, God or the gods behave like men \u2014 wrathful, scornful, jealous, and imperious.\n\nReleased Sudanese Christian woman faces 2 new charges\n\nHowever, this is not why so many people \u2014 women and men alike \u2014 are religious.\n\nReligious faith at its best is an attempt to define the meaningfulness of life and give life ultimate nobility in facing death.\n\nReligious faith also provide many communities moral rules and grammar for all types of relationships\u2014marriage, neighborliness, sisterhood, brotherhood, and governance.\n\nAnd religious faiths often inspire individuals and communities to transcend their limitations in acts of reconciliation and justice through human rights campaigns and acts of mercy.\n\nNevertheless, the goodness of religion can be mired in ideologies of exclusion that can lead to bigotry on many levels, especially toward women.\n\nMormon feminist excommunicated for apostasy\n\nIn one sense of the word, Kelly and Ibrahim are apostates.\n\nOne dared to say that women could exercise religious authority where men are the \u201celders\u201d and keepers of the Kingdom.\n\nThe other, standing before an all-male court, refused to renounce her faith.\n\nIn both cases, men were the judges and held the keys to life and death - literally, in Ibrahim\u2019s case.\n\nIt would be utter silliness to argue that these two faith traditions are more sexist than Roman Catholics or Protestant Evangelicals or Japanese Shintoism. The practice of male dominance of spiritual authority is not peculiar to Mormons or Muslims.\n\nIn America, the pattern of male dominance began early, with the 1692 Salem Witch Trials and Anne Hutchinson, the Puritan woman who was tried for insisting that God\u2019s grace was freely given to everyone.\n\nHutchinson, a mother of 15 children, dared to challenge the male Calvinist clergy about whether they were being true to their theological convictions on questions of grace.\n\nThe case hinged on Hutchinson\u2019s claim to spiritual authority, and this is always where the rubber meets the road.\n\nWhenever women challenge the spiritual authority of men, whether by claiming a new faith or interpreting the orthodoxies of establish faith, their views have been seen as a political challenge to male dominance.\n\nAnd the response has consistently been to either shut them up through shunning or eliminating them as enemies of the state.\n\nFor centuries, women have been stoned, burned at the stake, murdered in honor killings and more for spiritual daring.\n\nHistorically, women have displayed enormous piety and faith in all religions. Nevertheless, male religious authorities have tried to keep women\u2019s faith expressions tame.\n\nThey note the Virgin in the Roman Catholic tradition or how there was a rough equality between the Prophet Muhammad and his first wife Khad\u012bja al-Kubra or the great perseverance Mormon women as they trekked to Utah.\n\nAnd all those examples hold some truth.\n\nHowever, history demonstrates that patriarchy often rules.\n\nWhat Kate Kelly and Meriam Ibrahim have done is what all religious people must do: challenge the patriarchal assumptions of institutional religion and governments alike.\n\nTheir bravery demonstrates that the province of faith does not belong to a male bishop or a political state.\n\nThe good news here is that these two brave women stand in a long tradition of women who have challenged male religious and political authority in the name of freedom.\n\nFor religious believers, agnostics, and atheists alike, the one thing we can all agree on is that the freedom to believe - or not to believe \u2013 can\u2019t be based on gender.\n\nAfter all, God is not a man.\n\nRandal Maurice Jelks is a professor of American and African-American studies at the University of Kansas and co-editor of the blog The Black Bottom.
