The Lions did not officially confirm the decision to let the deadline pass without franchising their 28-year-old All-Pro, but the report on the team\u2019s website said Detroit concluded that the franchise tag\u2019s price of around $27 million for Suh proved too daunting.\n\nLast month, general manager Martin Mayhew said he was optimistic about getting a deal done with Suh, but the franchise tag was probably the team\u2019s best source of leverage, and even that would have come at a prohibitive cost.\n\nSuh has been a force in the middle of Detroit\u2019s defensive line ever since the Lions drafted him with the second overall pick in 2010. He has 36 sacks in five seasons, including 8 1/2 in 2014, when the Lions made the playoffs as a wild card while boasting one of the league\u2019s top defenses.\n\nSuh has been hit with several fines in his career for his aggressive on-field actions, and he was nearly suspended for Detroit\u2019s playoff game at Dallas last season \u2014 a one-game ban for stepping on Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers was overturned on appeal. But that occasional drama has done little to detract from Suh\u2019s overall value to the Lions, who now face the prospect of having to bid against other teams for his services.\n\nSuh, quarterback Matthew Stafford and wide receiver Calvin Johnson \u2014 all of whom came to the Lions via high draft picks \u2014 have helped Detroit reach the postseason twice in the last four years. The Lions were able to secure Stafford and Johnson on long-term deals beyond their rookie contracts, but so far they\u2019ve been unable to sign Suh.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Lions won\u2019t franchise defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh, per report", "title": "Lions won\u2019t franchise defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh, per report", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/02/lions-wont-franchise-defensive-tackle-ndamukong-suh-per-report/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150302__ndamukong-suhp1.jpg", "height": 472}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150302__ndamukong-suhp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-02T09:46:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T16:38:07+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "DETROIT \u2014 Ndamukong Suh can test the open market when free agency begins March 10 after the Lions decided not to use the franchise tag on the star defensive tackle, according to a report on the team\u2019s website.\nSuh has been a force in the middle of Detroit\u2019s defensive line ever since the Lions drafted him with the second overall pick in 2010.\nThe Lions were able to secure Stafford and Johnson on long-term deals beyond their rookie contracts, but so far they\u2019ve been unable to sign Suh.\nMonday is the deadline for teams to designate franchise or transition players.\nSuh, quarterback Matthew Stafford and wide receiver Calvin Johnson \u2014 all of whom came to the Lions via high draft picks \u2014 have helped Detroit reach the postseason twice in the last four years."}
