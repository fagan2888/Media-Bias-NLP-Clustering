The system includes 11 acute care hospitals and dozens of other facilities from Hudson and Essex down to Mercer and Ocean counties.\n\n\u201cAs far as what\u2019s driving it, a lot of this is happening because of both the Affordable Care Act and so much uncertainty in the market,\u201d said Linda Schwimmer.\n\nThat\u2019s because the law \u2014 informally known as Obamacare \u2014 put financial pressure on hospitals to provide better care at lower costs. Most analysts will agree the best way to accomplish that is often through larger systems. That\u2019s what Barnabas Health and NJTV trustee CEO Barry Ostrowsky told NJTV News recently.\n\n\u201cIt should enhance patient care and it should do so in a number of ways. Number one the economies of scale of a bigger organization should be able to be reinvested in extending clinical programs making them more affordable and accessible,\u201d he said.\n\nThe potential is there, according to Renee Steinhagen with New Jersey Appleseed Public Interest Law Center. She says the trend isn\u2019t just happening because of federal health care changes. There\u2019s an overall push for less in-patient days going on in hospitals everywhere.\n\n\u201cSo what you\u2019re seeing is hospitals are going to start increasing outpatient clinics, decentralizing services and having less actual beds for acute care facilities. And that\u2019s part of what\u2019s going on in these mergers\u201d Steinhagen said.\n\nWhat does this mean for the consumer in terms of cost?\n\n\u201cWell the jury is still out on what it\u2019s going to mean for consumers with cost and quality and accountability so there\u2019s more questions than answers right now and the questions are will it really contain costs and will access be preserved,\u201d said New Jersey Citizen Action Health Care Program Director Maura Collinsgru.\n\nExecutives from both health systems say the merger won\u2019t lead to layoffs. They expect the different geographic reach will increase patients and in turn, revenue. Health care unions are cautiously optimistic though, as many mergers cut duplicate jobs and services to save money.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why it\u2019s important for the Department of Health to monitor this and make sure there is a system in place after these mergers do take place so that there is a check-in,\u201d said Health Professionals and Allied Employees Public Policy Director Bridget Devane.\n\nAs one expert put it, it\u2019s not the largeness we should be worried about, but how we hold these entities accountable to ensure the best quality and cost.\n\nFollow @BriVannozziNJTV", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "pubdate": 20160408, "og": {"site_name": "NJTV News", "description": "The new RWJBarnabas, the product of a merger between Robert Wood Johnson and Barnabas Health, includes 11 acute care hospitals and dozens of other facilities and will reach nearly 5 million people.
