John Kasich of Ohio is defending himself and his New Hampshire campaign from an attack ad that says he supports President Barack Obama\u2019s unpopular Obamacare program.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in court suing people to stop Obamacare,\u201d Kasich told host Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe ad from the American Future Fund super-PAC calls the Ohio governor the \u201cObama Republican.\u201d The narrator concludes by saying \u201cCommon Core. Obama\u2019s Medicaid Expansions. Tax Increases. Barack Obama? No. John Kasich.\u201d\n\nThe anti-Kasich ad is a problem for for the governor, who is struggling against three other establishment GOP candidates for a critical win in New Hampshire.\n\nMost of the Fox interview focused on Kasich\u2019s decision to join part of Obamacare that the Supreme Court left to each state: the decision whether to expand Ohio\u2019s Medicaid program, government-funded healthcare for lower-income people.\n\nWallace ran a clip from a pro-Kasich political ad in which the Republican claimed he had \u201crejected Obamacare.\u201d Wallace then said that Kasich\u2019s expansion of Medicaid was a \u201cpillar of Obamacare,\u201d and that he had gone \u201caround your Republican-controlled legislature to impose it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when the two-term governor disputed Wallace\u2019s statement, saying, \u201cI\u2019m in court suing people to stop Obamacare.\u201d\n\nKasich\u2019s defensive claim appears to be untrue.\n\nWhile Ohio has joined a couple lawsuits against Obamacare, the Ohio attorney general, who is elected separately from the governor, decides for the state whether to sue. The governor of Ohio has no say in the matter.\n\nWhen Republicans in Ohio refused to pass a law joining Obamacare, Kasich did so through executive action, pushing it through an administrative body called the Controlling Board.\n\nAccording to legal experts, Obamacare has five pillars. One is the individual mandate, to create demand. The other four create supply: (1) the employer mandate, requiring large employers to furnish Obamacare-compliant healthcare policies, (2) state insurance exchanges, (3) taxpayer subsidies for working-income Americans to buy policies on the exchanges, paid for by other Americans, and (4) expanding Medicaid to cover millions of low-income Americans with a single-payer, socialized system.\n\nKasich offended many social conservatives when he claimed in 2013 that he was living out the Christian faith by expanding government-run healthcare through joining Obamacare, implying a moral imperative to do so. It is a theme that he has consistently raised in his presidential run.\n\nKen Klukowski is legal editor for Breitbart News.
