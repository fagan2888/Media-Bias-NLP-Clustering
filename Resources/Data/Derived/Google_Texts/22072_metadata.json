It was a flop.\n\nThat\u2019s how House Speaker Pro Tem Jody Richards described the much-ballyhooed announcement by Minority Leader Jeff Hoover that last Monday might be a historic day in the Kentucky House of Representatives.\n\nTurns out that whatever Hoover, a Jamestown Republican, thought was going to happen, didn\u2019t.\n\nIt was a bit like the Cincinnati Bengals getting mouthy in the minutes before losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers on a last-second field goal.\n\nEven though one might have an advantage, it\u2019s still not easy to beat history.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what the Republicans are trying to do here, having not controlled the House since silent movie actress Gloria Swanson was the cat\u2019s meow.\n\nHoover never explained exactly what he was talking about when he made his bold prediction, but most speculation centered on Democratic House members either taking jobs in the administration of Gov. Matt Bevin or deciding to caucus with Republicans to elect either Hoover or a Democrat beholden to a large Republican minority.\n\nHouse speaker Greg Stumbo quipped that the only history being made last Monday was Hoover\u2019s extension of his own record as the longest serving House Minority leader in Kentucky\u2019s history.\n\nDemocrats think \u2013 maybe wishfully \u2013 that talk of Republicans taking control of the House is now quelled at least until March 8, when voters in four House districts will head to the polls in special elections to select replacements for two Republicans who moved up to statewide office and two Democrats who accepted jobs from Bevin.\n\nTo be sure, those are key races. If the Democrats can hold on to two of the seats, they\u2019ve got real hope of holding onto the House until at least next fall. If the Democrats can\u2019t stop the GOP momentum, they\u2019ve got serious problems.\n\nBut even if the Democrats hold, they\u2019ve got potential problems in November \u2013 especially if Democratic incumbents in swing districts decide the political winds are against them and stay home.\n\nRep. Mike Denham, of Maysville, has already announced that he\u2019s not returning for health reasons, and that district could easily go Republican.\n\nWith just over a week to go before the deadline to file for office, eight other Democrats haven\u2019t filed to run again, including several in areas that sometimes \u2013 or even regularly \u2013 vote Republican.\n\nThose include Reps. Johnny Bell, of Glasgow; Russ Meyer, of Nicholasville; and Kevin Sinnette, of Ashland.\n\nHouse Speaker Greg Stumbo and Majority Leader Rocky Adkins often say that the Democrats, damaged by the national Democratic brand, are better suited to defend incumbent seats in local elections where voters know the Democrats and don\u2019t associate them with the national party figures.\n\nHe\u2019s correct, to a degree. But the dynamics change when Democratic incumbents decide not to run again. Especially when the Republicans put all their effort into flipping the House.\n\nRepublicans hope to raise more than $1 million at an event Friday in Louisville that will be headlined by Bevin and U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Even if they don\u2019t hit that goal, it likely won\u2019t be a flop.\n\nJoseph Gerth can be reached at 502-582-4702 or jgerth@courier-journal.com.
