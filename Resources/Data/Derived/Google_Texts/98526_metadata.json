But could it be just what the doctor ordered for the American Care Act?\n\nThere are less than three weeks before the 2014 registration window for coverage under the Affordable Care Act closes, and the decision to shoot the video is stark evidence of the Obama Administration\u2019s willingness to pull out all the stops in order to lift the percentage of young adults who\u2019ve signed up for healthcare insurance under the law.\n\nAs Obama says midway through Galifianakis\u2019s awkward interrogation, \u201cWell, first of all, I think it\u2019s fair to say that I wouldn\u2019t be with you here today if I didn\u2019t have something to plug. Have you heard of the Affordable Care Act?\u201d (Galifianakis\u2019s response: \u201cOh yeah, I heard about that, that\u2019s the thing that doesn\u2019t work. Why would you get the guy that created the Zune to make your website?\u201d)\n\nBy standard metrics, the plug has been successful: The staged interview is already the online comedy website\u2019s most-viewed video of the year, having soared from zero to 12 million views overnight; the hashtag associated with the video, #OBTF, had become a trending topic on Twitter, and Tara McGuinness, the White House\u2019s dedicated Healthcare communications advisor, had a tweet posted on her account within hours of the video\u2019s release that the webisode was now the single largest generator of visits to the ACA health exchange site HealthCare.gov:\n\nFunnyordie video has 11 million views. http://t.co/a7HUExG0vg traffic for yesterday was up almost 40% from Monday. \u2014 Tara McGuinness (@HealthCareTara) March 12, 2014\n\nBy evening, HealthCare.gov had put some specific numbers behind McGuinness\u2019s claim, announcing that the video had, on its own, generated over 32,000 visits to the site that day; McGuinness followed that up this morning with a retweeted report that traffic from FunnyorDie.com had helped to boost overall HealthCare.gov traffic by 40%.\n\nBut healthcare observers caution that it\u2019s too soon to say whether the media stunt has truly succeeded in its underlying aim of enhancing the percentage of signups from 18 to 34 year olds from its current 25% toward a more actuarially appealing 40%. (Participation by younger \u2014 and proportionately, healthier \u2014 individuals is key to preventing the healthcare program from falling into a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d of skyrocketing rates and plummeting usage.)\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s smart of them to try something new to engage young people,\u201d says Judy Wang, \u201cfounding hacker\u201d of MIT\u2019s healthcare and technology innovation incubator Hacking Medicine. \u201cMy fear is that showing up on a show like \u2018Between Two Ferns\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean that the young people who do watch that show will take the ACA seriously. I don\u2019t doubt its ability to get young people to at least visit the site, but has that translated into actual sign ups, and do young people actually understand why signing up at healthcare.gov is supposed to benefit them and their fellow citizens in the long run?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a fair question. The video, which features Obama in the typical role of a straight man forced to deal with Galifianakis\u2019s barrage of aggressively insulting and nonsensical questions, ricochets from topics like the White House tradition of pardoning a turkey on Thanksgiving, to \u201cAmbassador Dennis Rodman\u201d going to North Korea (or perhaps, \u201cNorth Ikea\u201d), to a few of the hot-button personal tropes the Obama has had to confront during his two terms, including where he was born (he was born in Hawaii).\n\nOn the other hand, it also allows the President to state outright that HealthCare.gov \u201cworks great now,\u201d that it has allowed millions of Americans to sign up for affordable health insurance, and that young invincibles can \u201cget coverage\u2026for what it costs to pay your cell phone bill.\u201d And it underscores the March 31st deadline for 2014 coverage, and even the free 1-800-318-2596 HealthCare.gov hotline number for the few people watching the video \u2014 which is online, after all \u2014 who don\u2019t have a computer capable of accessing the self-serve site.\n\nWang notes that the reasons why young people haven\u2019t yet signed up in broad numbers range widely from ignorance \u2014 that is to say, lack of awareness of the HealthCare.gov site or the ACA\u2019s potential benefits \u2014 to apathy, to outright resistance to the ACA as a program. The video, she agrees, addresses at least the category of young consumers. And the second might just resolve itself: \u201cYoung people tend to put things off until the last minute, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there was a spike in enrollments the day before the deadline\u201d \u2014 though no one knows whether a 12th-hour surge will be able to give the program the actuarial mix it needs to thrive.\n\nAs with most viral videos, however, the disruptive value of the White House\u2019s curveball maneuver isn\u2019t readily measurable in the first day of its release; according to research by Unruly Media, sharing of viral videos tends to peak on the second day after release \u2014 which would be today \u2014 and to generate a quarter of their total shares by day three, 50% of their total after three weeks, and two-thirds after three months. So this video will be a gift that keeps on giving traffic well into the ACA deadline and beyond.\n\nIf it succeeds, expect more experiments with viral distribution to come from a White House that\u2019s faced challenges in effectively getting the word out about ACA through traditional media sources, while dealing with an unending barrage of factually questionable right-wing advertising attacks. Can memes save Obama\u2019s greatest legacy?
