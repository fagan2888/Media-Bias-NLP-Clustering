If he doesn\u2019t take down his false ads and retract his lies, I will do so immediately.\u201d\n\nTrump, in recent weeks, has taken aim at Cruz for being born in Canada, saying that means he is not a natural born citizen and therefore unable to serve as president. Cruz, pointing out that his mother was American when he was born, says he is eligible.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Cruz\u2019s campaign released an ad saying voters \u201ccannot trust Donald Trump\u201d to nominate conservative justices to the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cTed Cruz is a totally unstable individual,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe is the single biggest liar I\u2019ve ever come across, in politics or otherwise, and I have seen some of the best of them. His statements are totally untrue and completely outrageous.\u201d\n\nTrump added: \u201cIt is hard to believe a person who proclaims to be a Christian could be so dishonest and lie so much.\u201d\n\nTrump countered Cruz\u2019s argument about the Supreme Court by noting that he specifically mentioned two conservative judges recently when discussing the types of people he would nominate to the court.\n\n\u201cCruz said I would be appointing a liberal judge when in fact I will appoint a great conservative and I am the only candidate who has gone so far, at the debate, as to suggest two individuals I feel would best represent the conservative values we need to protect: William \u2018Bill\u2019 Pryor Jr. and Diane Sykes,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump also took issue with other types of criticism from Cruz:\n\nCruz says I am pro-choice, when in fact I am staunchly pro-life and have been for a long time. Like Ronald Reagan, on many issues, I have evolved. Cruz says I am in favor of ObamaCare, when in fact I have spoken about repealing and replacing this disaster of a system at every speech throughout my campaign and since its inception. Meanwhile, Cruz was responsible for getting Bush to put in the judge that failed to vote against ObamaCare twice. Cruz says I will try to take away your second amendment rights, when I am one of the strongest proponents of the right to bear arms and I say so in every speech that I have made for years. I am a proud member of the NRA and so are my sons.\n\nTrump added: \u201cCruz has become unhinged and is lying with the hopes that his statements will go unchecked until after the election and he will save his failing campaign.\u201d\n\nFollow Alex on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Pappas", "description": "Donald Trump says he will sue Ted Cruz if he \u201cdoesn\u2019t take down his false ads and retract his lies\u201d about him.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Donald Trump says he will sue [crscore]Ted Cruz[/crscore] if his rival for the Republican nomination for president doesn't \"doesn't take down his false ads and retract his lies\" about him.
