Nothing, except that you \u2014 looking too much like a two-device-weilding Hillary Clinton \u2014 don\u2019t watch the news.\n\n\u201cSometimes when you\u2019re watching the news \u2014 which I generally don\u2019t do because I \u2014 whatever they\u2019re reporting on I usually know about. But it can get depressing, right? It can feel as if, oh, nothing is working and everything is a crisis,\u201d Obama said during a speech at a Democratic National Committee event last July.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want, and I don\u2019t think any of us should want as citizens, a White House that governs by cable news,\u201d former White House press secretary Jay Carney said last October, explaining why the president keeps a \u201chealthy distance\u201d from cable news.\n\nObama claims he doesn\u2019t want to be \u201cinundated\u201d with politics during the day, opting instead to watch ESPN.\n\nIs \u201cSportsCenter\u201d suddenly covering Hillary Clinton? She sure looks like she has one heck of a jump shot. However, ESPN\u2019s story on Hillary\u2019s press conference Tuesday would have ran with the headline \u201cAir ball.\u201d\n\nFor further reminder of Obama\u2019s love-hate relationship with the news:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "President Obama has consistently -- either by his own accord or through his press secretary -- attributed his knowledge of various scandals to news reports about them, thereby excusing himself from appearing at all complicit in said scandals.", "title": "Obama continues to learn of scandals through news reports without...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2015/01/Obama-House-Democrats_Dobs-600x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2015/03/11/obama-continues-learn-scandals-news-reports-without-watching-news/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "obama-watch-news", "published_time": "2015-03-11T14:26:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-11T14:26:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Obama continues to learn of scandals through news reports without watching the newsIt\u2019s not only Hillary Clinton who has had some moments of hypocrisy as of late.\nNothing, except that you \u2014 looking too much like a two-device-weilding Hillary Clinton \u2014 don\u2019t watch the news.\nPresident Obama has consistently \u2014 either by his own accord or through his press secretary \u2014 attributed his knowledge of various scandals to news reports about them, thereby excusing himself from appearing at all complicit in said scandals.\nIs \u201cSportsCenter\u201d suddenly covering Hillary Clinton?\n\u201cSometimes when you\u2019re watching the news \u2014 which I generally don\u2019t do because I \u2014 whatever they\u2019re reporting on I usually know about."}
