Several have implemented similar cost-cutting measures, including downsizing of staff.\"\n\nIn a press conference Thursday afternoon, Ritz noted that the cuts represented relatively small changes for the company, which has more than 7,000 employees and about $950 million in annual operating revenue.\n\nThe news came a few days after Mercy leaders disclosed a plan to shutter an outpatient mental-health clinic that has 8,000 patients. However, Ritz emphasized that a psychiatrist shortage, not finances, were behind that move. He said if new psychiatrists are found, the clinic will remain open.\n\nOverall, Ritz said, the company is trying to save $38 million, either through budget reductions or through increased payments for services.\n\nRitz said that besides the 29 people who lost jobs, Mercy will not fill about 107 vacant positions. However, he said, some of the people whose jobs were eliminated probably will find new positions among the 300 other openings the company is actively trying to fill. Others may be hired by related health-care companies, he said.\n\nThe positions that were cut are mainly support or management jobs, Ritz said. They aren't direct patient-care positions.\n\nRitz emphasized that the changes mainly reflect a continuing shift from inpatient hospital services to outpatient treatment. A few of the underlying issues are related to the Affordable Care Act, he said, but most of them aren't.\n\nRitz said that although Mercy is feeling a financial pinch, it remains profitable. \"We're not doing this because we're weak,\" he told reporters.\n\nRitz, who took the reins at Mercy last year, cited several reasons for the system's financial concerns. The first factor he cited in his memo to employees was low reimbursements from the government's Medicare and Medicaid insurance programs. \"Mercy loses tens of millions of dollars each year providing care to patients covered by government programs,\" Ritz wrote. Iowa medical leaders have complained for many years that the public programs short-change health-care providers here.\n\nAt the press conference, Ritz also referred to a Medicare rules change that defines people as outpatients unless they spend \"two midnights\" in a hospital. That shift alone costs Mercy $8 million per year, he said. It is not part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRitz also wrote that Mercy has not been sufficiently rewarded for taking part in a new way of organizing health care. Mercy was one of the first Iowa hospital systems to embrace the idea of Accountable Care Organizations, under which insurers are supposed to reward hospitals and doctors for keeping people well instead of just for providing more treatment when patients become ill.\n\nThe approach, which is encouraged by the federal Affordable Care Act, is supposed to increase health-care quality while decreasing costs.\n\nIn his memo this week, Ritz indicated Mercy has been faring poorly under the new arrangement. \"The Mercy ACO and its providers have been tremendously successful in improving the health of people with chronic diseases,\" Ritz wrote. \"As a result, admissions to the medical center are down and we have saved the payers millions of dollars. Unfortunately, the economic rewards from payers have been small.\"\n\nRitz told reporters that Mercy's inpatient admissions are down about 2.2 percent this fiscal year. Mercy narrowly missed a savings target for 2013 under the Medicare portion of its Accountable Care Organization. Because of that, he said, Medicare did not provide several million dollars in expected incentives. However, he said, Mercy remains committed to the idea and is optimistic that it will gain ACO rewards from Medicare next year.\n\nHe said the hospital has yet to see a substantial decrease in need for charity care, which was expected to happen as more Americans gained health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRitz said the company has a current operating margin of 0.9 percent. That margin, which is akin to a profit level, was supposed to be 2.9 percent this fiscal year, he wrote in his memo. But he said at the press conference that the company's margin has improved in recent months.\n\nScott McIntyre, a spokesman for the Iowa Hospital Association, said many Iowa hospitals are feeling financial pinches. The main problem, he said, is that hospital and clinic systems are not being rewarded sufficiently for successful efforts to keep patients healthy and out of hospitals. Statewide, the number of inpatients at Iowa hospitals dropped about 3 percent last year. The health-care providers are doing their part, he said, \"but the payers in a large way are still doing business as usual.\"\n\nJennifer Perry, a spokeswoman for Mercy rival UnityPoint Health-Des Moines, expressed understanding of Mercy's moves. \"The health care environment is constantly changing and we have seen these changes first hand as reimbursement approaches change and more care is provided at alternative sites, such as hospital outpatient departments, our clinics and through our home health division,\" she wrote in a statement. Perry said UnityPoint is financially stable, but also has taken measures to reduce costs. The company has not had layoffs in recent years, she said, although it did offer some early retirements a couple of years ago.\n\nThe Register asked the state's dominant health-insurer, Wellmark Blue Cross & Blue Shield for response to Mercy's complaint about low reimbursement from private carriers. Wellmark spokeswoman Traci McBee replied that the insurer has been increasing payments to hospitals for 15 years by amounts linked to the general inflation rate. It plans to do so again on July 1. She also noted that Mercy could gain incentives from Wellmark under its Accountable Care Organization.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2014/05/15/mercy-hospital-des-moines-layoffs/9131849/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Mercy laid off 29 workers this week and plans to cut at least $15 million from its budget.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Mercy laid off 29 workers this week and plans to cut at least $15 million from its budget.", "title": "Mercy lays off 29 workers", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2014/05/15/mercy-hospital-des-moines-layoffs/9131849/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mercy laid off 29 workers this week and plans to cut at least $15 million from its budget.", "creator": "@DMRegister", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4738bb80417d938dafaa663de9678a181b8cbabb/c=392-0-2840-2448&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/DesMoines/DesMoines/2014/05/15//1400179449000-MercyHospital.jpg", "title": "Mercy lays off 29 workers", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "news/health", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/135b1db4c04440c74631e3ce275d3bc027611ae9/c=685-0-2520-2448/local/-/media/DesMoines/DesMoines/2014/05/15//1400179449000-MercyHospital.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/37b13a8b95021badafd334f7c228681254c16f9e/c=392-0-2840-2448/local/-/media/DesMoines/DesMoines/2014/05/15//1400179449000-MercyHospital.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c43447d488c18c3d7e28c61b2ac2735423d50a4e/c=7-0-3264-2448/local/-/media/DesMoines/DesMoines/2014/05/15//1400179449000-MercyHospital.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1682d6897d38e62c798abf85da8e02cd20e9cc4a/c=0-176-3264-2017&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/DesMoines/DesMoines/2014/05/15//1400179449000-MercyHospital.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-05-15T23:54:09.150000-05:00", "shorthed": "Mercy lays off 29 workers; plans at least $15 million in cuts", "articleid": 9131849, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d79e20d4257849dcf1e7d485ecdd41a0aed9d78d/c=0-176-3264-2017/local/-/media/DesMoines/DesMoines/2014/05/15//1400179449000-MercyHospital.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9d4e7c83a4f6f429d5df41b512cf52d4875a1713/c=1031-0-2402-2448/local/-/media/DesMoines/DesMoines/2014/05/15//1400179449000-MercyHospital.jpg"}, "author": "Tony Leys", "title": "Mercy lays off 29 workers", "pageclass": "article", "gci-asset-type": "story"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Mercy Medical Center, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9924\"", "article_summary": "Scott McIntyre, a spokesman for the Iowa Hospital Association, said many Iowa hospitals are feeling financial pinches.\nRitz also wrote that Mercy has not been sufficiently rewarded for taking part in a new way of organizing health care.\n\"Mercy loses tens of millions of dollars each year providing care to patients covered by government programs,\" Ritz wrote.\nRitz said that besides the 29 people who lost jobs, Mercy will not fill about 107 vacant positions.\n\"The Mercy ACO and its providers have been tremendously successful in improving the health of people with chronic diseases,\" Ritz wrote."}
