What attracted me to the idea of using a web broker portal was being able to track all of my business in one place. I also liked the idea of being able to look up a clients application directly from the Healthcare.gov site without needing to call Healthcare.gov. If my client did not get an eligibility letter I could go back to their account and look it up. At the end of Open Enrollment I was able to save a copy of all of my clients in a spread sheet to my computer with all of their plan data. The fact that the site was mobile friendly made it easy for me to do business from an iPad even when I was on the go.

The main reason I decided to use a web broker site to submit my business was the promise that my National Producer Number (NPN) would be automatically electronically attached to each application that was submitted by me. So how did it go?
