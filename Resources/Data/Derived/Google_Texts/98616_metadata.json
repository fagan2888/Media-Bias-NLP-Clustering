Earnings fell to 43 cents per share from 56 cents a year ago.\n\nBut CEO Joseph Molina said the primary reasons for its big earnings miss were \u201cthe general failure of Medicaid rates to keep pace with the growing medical care costs,\u201d higher utilization by customers in Texas and Ohio, and higher-than-expected pharmacy costs \u2014 especially for high-cost specialty drugs.\n\nMolina\u2019s news appeared to weigh on the entire sector \u2014 even among competitors that have reported their own earnings in recent days. Shares of Centene (CNC), another Medicaid managed care company seeing big exchange membership gains, slipped 4%. UnitedHealth (UNH) eased 1.5%; Aetna (AET) 2.3%; and Anthem (ANTM) 2.6%.\n\nThe company, whose 4.2 million plan members include 339,000 in Puerto Rico, also highlighted the uncertain risks it faces from the Zika virus.\n\n\u201cWhile very few of the expectant mothers among our membership have contracted the virus, the full financial effects of Zika will not likely be known for several months,\u201d Molina said.\n\nMolina\u2019s exchange customer base has tended to be relatively low cost, requiring the company to transfer funds to insurers with higher-cost members via ObamaCare\u2019s risk-adjustment program. Updated risk-adjustment estimates were one reason for Molina\u2019s lower premium revenue per member in the first quarter, the company said. Though it\u2019s too early to know much about the new customers, Molina expects that they will tend toward the healthy side based on demographics that are similar to 2015 customers.\n\nMolina didn\u2019t say where its exchange membership surge came, but Texas looks to be one market where it gained market share. Molina now offers the two lowest-cost silver plans in Houston, having displaced Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas and another carrier.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Molina Healthcare said its ObamaCare exchange membership more than doubled to 630,000 in the first quarter, but its earnings dived and shares tumbled 18% early", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Molina Healthcare said its ObamaCare exchange membership more than doubled to 630,000 in the first quarter from 266,000 a year ago, but its earnings dived and shares\u00a0tumbled 18% early Friday.
