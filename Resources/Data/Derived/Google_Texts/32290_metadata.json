The Australian ship Ocean Shield, which is towing a U.S. Navy black box detector, picked up two more \u201cpings\u201d that were potentially from the plane\u2019s black box beacons. The beacons \u2014 one for the data recorder and one for the cockpit voice recorder \u2014 activate upon contact with water and have a battery life of 30 days.\n\nRetired Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, who is leading the joint search, called the latest pings \u201cencouraging information.\u201d Locating the black box would help the search team find the wreckage, and possibly solve the mystery of why MH370 veered off course and ended in the Indian Ocean.\n\n\u201cI believe we are searching in the right area,\u201d Houston told reporters at a briefing in Perth, Australia. \u201cBut we need to visually identify aircraft wreckage before we can confirm with certainty that this is the final resting place of MH370. For the sake of the 239 families, this is absolutely imperative.\u201d\n\nThe first two pings were heard by Ocean Shield on Saturday at 4:45 p.m. and 9:27 p.m. Perth time. One was heard for two hours and 20 minutes, the other for just 13 minutes. \u201cThe analysis determined that a very stable, distinct, and clear signal was detected at 33.331 kilohertz and that it consistently pulsed at a 1.106 second interval,\u201d Houston told reporters. \u201cThey, therefore, assess that the transmission was not of natural origin and was likely sourced from specific electronic equipment.\u201d Investigators are concluding that the signals are consistent with those from a black box, which generally transmits at 37.5 kilohertz.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Ocean Shield, the Australian ship towing a U.S. Navy black box detector, picked up two more promising signals", "title": "Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 update: Two pings relocated by Australian ship", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The Ocean Shield, the Australian ship towing a U.S. Navy black box detector, picked up two more promising signals", "title": "Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 update: Two pings relocated by Australian ship", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/04/09/malaysia_airlines_flight_mh370_update_two_pings_relocated_by_australian_ship/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/china-malaysia-plane.jpeg6-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Ocean Shield, the Australian ship towing a U.S. Navy black box detector, picked up two more promising signals", "title": "Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 update: Two pings relocated by Australian ship", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/china-malaysia-plane.jpeg6-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sarah Gray", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Australia, black box, malaysia airlines flight mh370, missing plane, search team", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbb4c\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Australia, black box, malaysia airlines flight mh370, missing plane, search team, Innovation News, NewsYesterday held promising developments in the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370.\nThe Australian ship Ocean Shield, which is towing a U.S. Navy black box detector, picked up two more \u201cpings\u201d that were potentially from the plane\u2019s black box beacons.\n\u201cI believe we are searching in the right area,\u201d Houston told reporters at a briefing in Perth, Australia.\n\u201cThe analysis determined that a very stable, distinct, and clear signal was detected at 33.331 kilohertz and that it consistently pulsed at a 1.106 second interval,\u201d Houston told reporters.\n\u201cBut we need to visually identify aircraft wreckage before we can confirm with certainty that this is the final resting place of MH370."}
