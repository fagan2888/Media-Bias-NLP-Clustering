Maloney, that he wanted to co-sponsor legislation reauthorizing the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, a law providing care to workers who became sick as a result of their exposure to polluted air after the trade center buildings fell.\n\nYet for others in the delegation, Mr. Donovan\u2019s arrival has rippled in a more disconcerting way. Several lawmakers said they remained suspicious of Mr. Donovan\u2019s role in the Garner case, and complained that a judge had sided with the prosecutor and had refused to release transcripts of the confidential grand jury proceedings.\n\nThe Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation into the case, in which a police officer\u2019s chokehold on Mr. Garner, who was unarmed, led to the man\u2019s death.\n\nIn his congressional race, Mr. Donovan seldom spoke about the Garner case: He said he had delegated the investigation to a team of lawyers in his office and that, while he stood by the grand jury\u2019s decision, he had never set foot in the courtroom himself.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRepresentative Gregory W. Meeks said he still wanted to know whether Mr. Donovan\u2019s office \u201cpresented a strong case or not.\u201d There is a tricky balancing act ahead, Mr. Meeks acknowledged, for members who criticized Mr. Donovan as a prosecutor but hope to work collaboratively in Washington.\n\n\u201cI, of course, am still working to correct what I believe was a miscarriage of justice with regards to the Garner case,\u201d Mr. Meeks said, adding: \u201cThat said, I also have a responsibility to work with individuals that I agree with on issues.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Hakeem Jeffries said he was troubled by the appearance that Mr. Donovan \u201cpresided over a stunning miscarriage of justice and was rewarded with a job in Congress.\u201d Mr. Donovan, he said, could allay some distrust by supporting criminal justice reform legislation in Congress.\n\n\u201cFor many, his arrival in Congress is like salt being poured over an open wound,\u201d Mr. Jeffries said. \u201cMoving forward, it is going to take a lot of constructive dialogue to get past the events of the last year.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIn an interview shortly after taking the oath of office, Mr. Donovan said that no one in the New York delegation had raised the Garner case with him directly. \u201cSome of them said harsh things about me, but I\u2019m not going to let that get in the way of governing,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former prosecutor described his reception on Capitol Hill as \u201cwonderfully welcoming,\u201d and ticked off a few areas where Democrats have already reached out to him: Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand called him about working together on the Zadroga bill; in a congratulatory phone call, Mr. Donovan said, Mayor Bill de Blasio said he hoped to have the Republican\u2019s support on homeland security issues.\n\nDuring a visit to Washington last week, Mr. de Blasio referred to the Republican congressman as \u201csomeone that I can work with.\u201d\n\nAs for law enforcement policy, Mr. Donovan said he would review any legislation his colleagues put forward, but stopped short of signing himself up as a partner in criminal justice reform. \u201cI certainly would want to look at what\u2019s being proposed,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDespite his landslide election to the House, Mr. Donovan\u2019s political image remains a work in progress: It was largely untested in his special-election campaign against an underfunded Democratic opponent, City Councilman Vincent J. Gentile. Mr. Donovan managed to evade questions on some key issues throughout the campaign, such as his precise position on the minimum wage and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade deal under consideration in Washington.\n\nMr. Donovan also reversed himself on the issue of health care, first saying it would be unnecessary to undo the Affordable Care Act, then calling for its wholesale repeal.\n\nNow that he will take votes almost daily as a member of Congress, Mr. Donovan will have to give swift definition to some of his hazier stances, and in the process walk a line between pleasing his party\u2019s leadership and protecting his popularity back home. Though his district has mainly elected Republicans, voters there supported President Obama in 2012. In addition, Staten Island\u2019s nonwhite population has grown by about 8 percentage points since 2000, according to the census; Democrats tend to have a powerful advantage among minority voters.\n\nMr. Donovan\u2019s Democratic colleagues took a skeptical view of what the Republican freshman might accomplish across the aisle. Representative Jerrold Nadler, the Manhattan Democrat, said that having a Staten Island Republican in the House could \u201ctheoretically\u201d be helpful. He cautioned, though, that Mr. Donovan\u2019s predecessors had limited success winning concessions for the city from Republican leaders.\n\nMr. Nadler, who in December called the lack of an indictment in the Garner investigation \u201cshocking and almost unfathomable,\u201d said he remained concerned about the resolution of the case. But Mr. Donovan, he said, would be scrutinized anew in Washington.\n\n\u201cWhat he did before \u2014 it was upsetting to me that the officer wasn\u2019t indicted,\u201d Mr. Nadler said. \u201cBut whether that was his fault or the grand jury\u2019s \u2014 I don\u2019t know. As a new member, he\u2019s going to be judged on what he does in Congress, and he should be.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150522130800, "twitter": {"description": "The lack
