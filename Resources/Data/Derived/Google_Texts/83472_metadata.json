Bush is on the comeback trail. After weeks of falling poll numbers, poor debate performances, campaign staff cuts and calls for him to stop wasting everyone\u2019s time and drop out of the race already, Bush decided instead to dial the Excitement Meter up to 11 by rebooting his campaign. Sure, reboots of already unpopular franchises don\u2019t always seize America\u2019s imagination. But like a studio that has already sunk $100 million into production costs for a terrible movie, some of Bush\u2019s backers might still be hoping for a return on their investment.\n\nSo on Monday the campaign unveiled its new direction with a snazzy slogan, \u201cJeb Can Fix It.\u201d Aside from bearing an unfortunate resemblance to the slogan long used by a wildly popular British entertainer who turned out to be an insatiable sexual predator, the slogan requires one to ask what it is, exactly, that Bush intends to fix. Our broken health care system? Not with that plan he\u2019s proposed, he isn\u2019t. The mess in the Middle East? His advisors had a hand in creating much of it the last time a Bush sat in the White House, so the argument for letting them clean it up isn\u2019t going to get much traction.\n\nAs a rallying cry, \u201cJeb Can Fix It\u201d feels a bit trite and undersized for the job of fixing the smoking and cratered dystopian hellscape that Republicans keep telling us America has become under the dictatorial misrule of the incompetent socialist Barack Obama. In terms of sheer bravado and promise, it\u2019s a far cry from \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d Bush is going to have to up his slogan-writing game if he\u2019s going to turn this thing around.\n\nThe campaign\u2019s other Monday reveal was the release of an e-book collection of emails from the candidate\u2019s time as governor of Florida. Bush was a prolific emailer during his time in office, trading messages with his staff and constituents for 25 to 30 hours a week, according to the book\u2019s own promotional blurb on Amazon. The book is reportedly filled with the esoteric policy details that often fills the days of the nation\u2019s governors, as well as emails related to the two biggest national stories of Bush\u2019s tenure: the 2000 election recount that installed his brother in the Oval Office and the Terri Schiavo case.\n\nPlus there are stories of just how deeply invested in his constituents\u2019 lives Bush became during his time in office. The Guardian reported on a Bush rally on Monday where he told a story about directing his team to help an old woman evict a wild raccoon that had taken up residence in her attic. (Houseguests! Always overstaying their welcome.) Great. When he\u2019s in the White House maybe he\u2019ll send his staff over to my house to help me deal with a persistent water leak.\n\nWhy any human being would spend the paltry sum of $2.99 to wade through a reported 730 pages of Jeb! Bush\u2019s emailed thoughts containing these and other stories is a mystery perhaps best left unsolved. Almost as big a mystery as why Bush would title his book \u201cReply All,\u201d thus reminding readers of all the times they have been stuck in unending email chains in which they didn\u2019t need to participate about office minutiae and wedding planning.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jeb is the wrong man, running at the wrong time.
