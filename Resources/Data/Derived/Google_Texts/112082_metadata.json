But are they?\n\nE-cigarettes aren't approved by the Food and Drug Administration in part because there has been very little research into how or whether they affect human health.\n\nAn e-cigarette or cigar may or may not look like it's tobacco-filled counterpart. Some resemble a pen or tire gauge. They're battery powered and activated when the user inhales through a mouthpiece. A heater vaporizes liquid nicotine into a small cartridge and also produces what looks like smoke. Some don't contain nicotine.\n\nAppearing on Monday's Smart Talk is Dr. Jonathan Foulds, a Professor of Public Health Sciences and Psychiatry at Penn State Hershey to discuss what he's learned about e-cigarettes.\n\nResearchers from Penn State University are conducting an online survey to improve understanding of electronic cigarettes. Electronic cigarette users may complete the survey anonymously, or can provide contact details at the end if interested in participating in a laboratory study of electronic cigarette use.\n\nPlease click on the link below to complete the survey.\n\nhttps://redcap.ctsi.psu.edu/redcap/surveys/?s=v94cbA\n\nDr. Jonathan Foulds\n\nAlso, patient portals could be the next big thing as part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPatient portals are on-line tools where patients can go 24 hours a day to schedule appointments, check medications and doctor's notes, and get answers to common health questions.\n\nwitf reporter Ben Allen has studied patient portals and will let us know what he's found.\n\nListen to the program:", "article_metadata": {"date": "Mar 16, 2014", "description": "Monday's Smart Talk studies e-cigarettes and patient portals.", "copyright": "WITF,Inc.", "url": "http://www.witf.org/smart-talk/2014/03/smart-talk-e-cigarettes-patient-portals.php", "twitter": {"description": "Monday's Smart Talk studies e-cigarettes and patient portals.", "title": "Smart Talk: E-cigarettes; Patient portals", "image": {"src": "http://www.witf.org/smart-talk/assets_c/2014/03/e-cigarette%20325%20x%20170-thumb-325x170-14104.jpg"}, "creator": "@witfnews", "site": "@witfnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index,follow", "p": {"domain_verify": "a0ab0edf38b22322d1aeb144003b161c"}, "keywords": "ben allen, dr. jonathan foulds, e-cigarettes, patient portals, transforming health", "article": {"section": "Smart Talk", "published_time": "2014-03-16T14:23:46-5:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-20T03:33:15-5:00"}, "og": {"site_name": "witf.org", "description": "Monday's Smart Talk studies e-cigarettes and patient portals.", "title": "Smart Talk: E-cigarettes; Patient portals", "url": "http://www.witf.org/smart-talk/2014/03/smart-talk-e-cigarettes-patient-portals.php", "image": "http://www.witf.org/smart-talk/assets_c/2014/03/e-cigarette%20325%20x%20170-thumb-325x170-14104.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "ben allen, dr. jonathan foulds, e-cigarettes, patient portals, transforming health"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2bff\"", "article_summary": "Listen to Smart Talk live online from 9-10 a.m. weekdays and at 7 p.m. (Repeat of 9 a.m. program) Host: Scott LaMarWhat to look for on Smart Talk Monday, March 17, 2014:Electronic cigarettes are being marketed as a safe alternative to traditional smokes.\nSmart Talk airs live every week day at 9 a.m. on WITF\u2019s 89.5 and 93.3.\nAppearing on Monday's Smart Talk is Dr. Jonathan Foulds, a Professor of Public Health Sciences and Psychiatry at Penn State Hershey to discuss what he's learned about e-cigarettes.\nwitf reporter Ben Allen has studied patient portals and will let us know what he's found.\nhttps://redcap.ctsi.psu.edu/redcap/surveys/?s=v94cbADr. Jonathan FouldsAlso, patient portals could be the next big thing as part of the Affordable Care Act."}
