Beginning Saturday, hundreds of thousands of Nevadans will be able to sign up for subsidized coverage under the Affordable Care Act through the Nevada Health Link insurance exchange.\n\nAlthough things didn\u2019t go so well for the marketplace last fall, exchange officials and insurance brokers alike said they expect an easier, more efficient process this time.\n\n\u201cI understand so well the frustrations and issues of last year, and we\u2019ve done everything in our power to make sure those are not repeated,\u201d Executive Director Bruce Gilbert said. \u201cI have high hopes that we\u2019ve been able to surmount those issues.\u201d\n\nBefore you test it out, there are ground rules.\n\nFirst, if you\u2019re one of the 32,000 or so Nevadans already enrolled in a plan through Nevada Health Link, you\u2019ll need to sign up through the system again. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be auto-renewed into a plan with no premium tax credit.\n\nAlso, if you need coverage to take effect on Jan. 1, you\u2019ll need to sign up and pay by Dec. 15. If the start date isn\u2019t an urgent matter, then you have until Feb. 15 to enroll in a plan and avoid a federal tax, which in 2015 will start at $325 or 2 percent of your income \u2014 whichever is higher. If you enroll before the 15th, your coverage will begin on the first of the next month. After the 15th, it doesn\u2019t take effect for 45 days.\n\nFinally, a lot has changed since the first enrollment go-round last October. Keeping that in mind will help you understand the process better, and know where to get help if you get stuck.\n\nMORE DIRECT CONTACT\n\nSo what\u2019s new about Nevada\u2019s system? Well, pretty much everything.\n\nFor starters, the technology has received a complete overhaul. Nevadans who want to enroll still have to start at nevadahealthlink.com. But rather than 2013\u2019s jumble of menu choices, the new version is streamlined, with just six buttons. What\u2019s more, enrollees will be pre-screened and directed to the right place before they even fill out an application. Eligible for Medicaid? The site will send you to Access Nevada. Qualify for a federally subsidized private plan? You\u2019re forwarded to healthcare.gov, the federal exchange\u2019s website.\n\nNevada is borrowing the federal site\u2019s enrollment system to avoid glitches that hurt enrollment, but for subsidy purposes, Nevada Health Link is considered a state-run marketplace because the state controls what plans are offered and how the system is funded.\n\nDumping the 2013 enrollment platform also should eliminate a big barrier to sign-ups last fall and spring. No longer will the exchange collect and distribute premium payments to insurers. Making Nevada Health Link the middleman between consumer and insurer caused payment problems for thousands of people. After Saturday, carriers will bill directly for new coverage.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be a lot less confusion on who paid what, when,\u201d said Brent Leavitt, a broker with Nevada Benefits.\n\nThe application process also has shrunk from 70 pages to 16 for most people, Gilbert said. There\u2019s no verification after every page \u2014 a process that bogged down 2013\u2019s launch. Gone are online \u201cwaiting rooms,\u201d where consumers were sent with no direction on when they could enroll, when the site is busy. A backup button lets users return to a prior page in the application if they need to change something. And the federal site has been re-engineered to handle twice as many simultaneous users as it had on its busiest day in the first enrollment period, Gilbert said.\n\n\u201cBecause of the improved work flow and a simplified application and enrollment process, we are cautiously optimistic \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say confident \u2014 that everything will proceed as expected,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cAs a practical matter, we feel really good. We anticipate a much better time this time around.\u201d\n\nStill, \u201cnothing of this size is flawless,\u201d Gilbert said, acknowledging potential \u201cbumps in the road.\u201d If things don\u2019t go as planned, consumers can get in-person enrollment help, as well as assistance directly from insurers \u2014 another first.\n\n\u2018BE PATIENT AND HAVE FAITH\u2019\n\nDon\u2019t give up if you get stuck while signing up.\n\nNevada Health Link has an \u201cenrollment store\u201d staffed by insurance brokers and navigators for shoppers who want to discuss options face-to-face or get around website-connection issues on their home computers. Southern Nevada\u2019s store is in The Boulevard, 3528 S. Maryland Parkway, Suite 384. Beginning Saturday, the store will be open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and noon to 7 p.m. Sunday. Extended hours on the 15th of each month will go from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.\n\nNevada Health Link also has a more streamlined broker-search function on its website. Click on the \u201cIndividuals and Families\u201d option, and go to the \u201cIn-Person Assistant\u201d option on the right. Choosing the \u201cFind Assistance\u201d box will let you search for a broker by ZIP code or by name.\n\n\u201cWe strongly urge consumers to work with brokers, agents and navigators, who can help them understand the differences between plans and help them make the best choice for their given situation,\u201d Gilbert said.\n\nAlso new this year, consumers can call insurers directly to enroll in a subsidized exchange plan. Plus, consumer options will expand with Time Insurance Co. becoming the fifth company offering subsidized coverage. Time also will have a national network, Leavitt said.\n\nAnd remember: You don\u2019t absolutely have to go through Nevada Health Link to buy coverage unless you\u2019re getting a tax credit. If you\u2019re not receiving a subsidy and the website gives you fits, consider calling an insurer directly or getting a broker to help you choose an off-exchange plan.\n\nIf you do use the site, fill out an offline version of your application and keep backup copies, Leavitt said. If the site goes down or you need to reapply, you\u2019ll know what information you already entered.\n\nMost important, \u201cbe patient and have faith that things are going to work. That\u2019s what got me through last year,\u201d said Leavitt, who signed up about 400 people \u2014 more than any other broker \u2014 through Nevada Health Link in the first enrollment session. \u201cBrokers want the business. Carriers want the business. The government wants you to sign up for insurance. Everyone is on your side. It\u2019s just a matter of having patience.\u201d\n\nGilbert said the exchange has no enrollment goal for the sign-up period. The exchange had a target of 118,000 sign-ups in its first year, but maxed out at 38,000 in the summer. Leavitt said his goal is to more than double his enrollments, to 1,000 by February.\n\nContact Jennifer Robison at jrobison@reviewjournal.com.
