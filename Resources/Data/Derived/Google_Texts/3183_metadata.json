Colorado\u2019s own big eater Bryan \u201cBig Sexy\u201d Beard shared with me some thoughts on Stonie during our interview earlier this week:\n\nThe one guy that I\u2019m enjoying watching chase Joey is Matt Stonie. They both live in San Jose, Calif. A couple years ago when he first got into it, I competed with him a couple times. The kid is amazing. It is ridiculous what this kid is doing. And I had the pleasure of sitting next to those two at the cow brain taco eating contest at the zombie pub crawl in Minneapolis a couple years ago. They just thoroughly embarrassed me. I think they were in the 50s and I think I hit, like, 12. It was cold cow brains. I understand you can get past the taste, but at this point, I\u2019m looking down and I\u2019m seeing its actual form of brain and it\u2019s cold and it doesn\u2019t taste like beef like I thought it was going to. It was one of those, just pack it up, pack it in because you\u2019re eating with the best two in the world. They came to duel it out.\n\nWatch Stonie eat a five-pound, 18-inch burrito in less than two minutes:\n\n\n\nFour Chipotle burritos and a diet coke:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Colorado Sports", "description": "Colorado's own big eater Bryan \"Big Sexy\" Beard shared with me some thoughts on Matt Stonie during our interview earlier this week.", "title": "Bryan \"Big Sexy\" Beard on Nathan's hot dog champ Matt Stonie", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/2015/07/04/bryan-big-sexy-beard-on-nathans-hot-dog-champ-matt-stonie/27947/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/files/2015/07/matt-stonie2-495x330.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Colorado's own big eater Bryan \"Big Sexy\" Beard shared with me some thoughts on Matt Stonie during our interview earlier this week.", "creator": "@JoeNguyen", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/2015/07/04/bryan-big-sexy-beard-on-nathans-hot-dog-champ-matt-stonie/27947/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/files/2015/07/matt-stonie2-495x330.jpg", "title": "Bryan \u201cBig Sexy\u201d Beard on Nathan\u2019s hot dog champ Matt Stonie", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "news_keywords": "Bryan Beard,competitive eating,Matt Stonie", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Colorado's own big eater Bryan \"Big Sexy\" Beard shared with me some thoughts on Matt Stonie during our interview earlier this week."}, "article_summary": "Colorado\u2019s own big eater Bryan \u201cBig Sexy\u201d Beard shared with me some thoughts on Stonie during our interview earlier this week:The one guy that I\u2019m enjoying watching chase Joey is Matt Stonie.\nMatt Stonie shocked the world of competitive eating Saturday when he beat eight-time champion Joey Chestnut for the Nathan\u2019s Hot Dog Eating Contest title.\nWatch Stonie eat a five-pound, 18-inch burrito in less than two minutes:Four Chipotle burritos and a diet coke:\nIt was one of those, just pack it up, pack it in because you\u2019re eating with the best two in the world.\nStonie, 23, has a long list of accomplishments in his Major League Eating profile, including 14.5 pounds of birthday cake, 101 three-inch tacos, 10.5 pounds of frozen yogurt."}
