We get a paid a non-negotiated rate set by the government.\u201d\n\nIf rate review was to be eliminated, citizens and businesses across the state would be paying more for healthcare services, Pitrolo contended.\n\n\u201cI believe that this will cause cost increases; Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) requires them (businesses) to insure (employees),\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at millions of dollars of cost increases to citizens and businesses.\u201d\n\nWest Virginia has required hospitals to submit requests for price hikes since 1985, but Letnaunchyn said too much has changed since then to continue what in his mind was an outdated process.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a process that was put in place in the 1980\u2019s, and has really become a barrier for us,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we move into the new payment environment with payment bundling, with binding hospital and physician services, we have to bill differently, act differently and operate differently than we did in the 80\u2019s.\u201d\n\nLetnaunchyn further argued that hospital rates are already scrutinized heavily enough without more review from the Healthcare Authority.\n\n\u201cIf they charge a four-percent increase and certain rates are a six-percent increase, the community knows that. We just don\u2019t think we should go through the process with the agency where they can tell us what to charge.\u201d\n\nAll but two hospitals in the state support repealing rate review. Raleigh General Hospital and Logan General Hospital had doubts about the bill\u2019s effect on insurance contracts, said Letnaunchyn.\n\nThe full Senate floor will next address the bill.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senate Health and Human Resources committee advanced bill after hearing from  State Healthcare Authority and West Virginia Hospital Association.", "og": {"site_name": "WV MetroNews", "description": "Senate Health and Human Resources committee advanced bill after hearing from  State Healthcare Authority and West Virginia Hospital Association.", "title": "Bill to repeal hospital rate regulation advances; causes controversy", "url": "http://wvmetronews.com/2016/02/02/bill-to-repeal-hospital-rate-regulation-passes-causes-controversy/", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/metronews/images/metronews-default-color.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@wvmetronews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 439959236158130, "pages": 327490709044}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-03T00:39:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-03T01:19:19+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Currently, only Maryland and West Virginia are the only U.S. states that have rate review.\nThe West Virginia Hospital Association supports getting rid of rate review because the current healthcare model has made it more difficult for hospitals to see a profit.\nRaleigh General Hospital and Logan General Hospital had doubts about the bill\u2019s effect on insurance contracts, said Letnaunchyn.\n\u201cWhen we increase charges for certain services, that doesn\u2019t turn into revenue,\u201d said President and CEO of the WV Hospital Association Joe Letnaunchyn.\nWe get a paid a non-negotiated rate set by the government.\u201dIf rate review was to be eliminated, citizens and businesses across the state would be paying more for healthcare services, Pitrolo contended."}
