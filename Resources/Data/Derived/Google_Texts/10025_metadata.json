The Panama City Mall is packed full of shoppers looking to cash in on the sales.\n\n\"It's my favorite time,\" said Rhonda Berry. \"I should say Thanksgiving is and it is, but I love Black Friday.\"\n\nBlack Friday has become a tradition for many like Rhonda Berry who's participated for the past 20 years.\n\n\"You know it's worth it. It's the adrenaline,\" said Berry. \"That's what most people come out here for. It's the deals, but it's the adrenaline.\"\n\nNow the sales are starting even earlier.\n\n\"I kind of like to think of it as Gray Thursday,\" said Erin Wommack, the Marketing Director at the Panama City Mall. \"It's like a preview before the actual Black Friday and I do feel like it's growing larger and larger as a whole. I feel that people will eat earlier rather than later and will come out and the lines out of our department stores are huge.\"\n\nEven though things can get crazy.\n\n\"I've seen things being thrown,\" said Berry. \"I've actually been in the middle where things were thrown above my head.\"\n\n\"Fights. Knives pulled. All kinds of stuff,\" said Chris Brown.\n\nPeople say the sales are worth it.\n\n\"I just love it,\" said Kelsey Reed.\n\n\"I love the deals. You can't get a better deal,\" said Augusta Reed.\n\nThe mall is beefing up security and many stores are bringing in extra employees to handle the crowds.\n\n\"We have hired a lot of additional security and I feel like we are all ready and prepared here at Panama City Mall to have a super successful Thanksgiving evening and Black Friday,\" said Wommack.\n\nThe mall will be open until 1 AM on Friday with select stores staying open all night long. Then they'll have a grand reopening at 6 AM Friday and will close at 10 PM.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Black Friday has become a national past-time and the high demand for sales has the shopping frenzy starting earlier, and many are calling it Gray Thursday.", "language": "english", "author": "Kelly Baumgarten", "og": {"url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Shoppers-Pack-the-Panama-City-Mall-for-Gray-Thursday-355307441.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/blackfriday24.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Black Friday has become a national past-time and the high demand for sales has the shopping frenzy starting earlier, and many are calling it Gray Thursday.", "title": "Shoppers pack the Panama City Mall for"}, "twitter": {"description": "Black Friday has become a national past-time and the high demand for sales has the shopping frenzy starting earlier, and many are calling it Gray Thursday.", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Shoppers-Pack-the-Panama-City-Mall-for-Gray-Thursday-355307441.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/blackfriday24.jpg", "title": "Shoppers pack the Panama City Mall for", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Shoppers pack the Panama City Mall for", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Shoppers pack the Panama City"}, "article_summary": "\"I kind of like to think of it as Gray Thursday,\" said Erin Wommack, the Marketing Director at the Panama City Mall.\nThe Panama City Mall is packed full of shoppers looking to cash in on the sales.\n\"I should say Thanksgiving is and it is, but I love Black Friday.\"\n\"We have hired a lot of additional security and I feel like we are all ready and prepared here at Panama City Mall to have a super successful Thanksgiving evening and Black Friday,\" said Wommack.\nThe mall will be open until 1 AM on Friday with select stores staying open all night long."}
