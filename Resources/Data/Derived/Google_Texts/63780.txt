A group of people came together this afternoon at Skate Odyssey to discuss stopping the violence.

Mothers of Murdered Children is an organization that is focusing on the violence in our area and looking at ways to prevent it. At Saturdayâ€™s event, they were hearing from young people about what they believe is causing people to turn to guns to solve a problem. Sherren Smith's son was murdered six months ago. She hopes to use her tragedy to prevent someone else from having to go through it.

"Coming together as one with unity. Trying to stop some of the violence that we have. Trying to make sure our children have an outlet to become productive citizens in Meridian and America," Founder of Mothers of Murdered Children Sherren Smith says.
