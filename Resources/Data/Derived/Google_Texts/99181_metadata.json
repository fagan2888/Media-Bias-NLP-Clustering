Their revenues must, like all businesses, cover their expenses. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has changed the financial model for health insurance carriers by pegging medical loss ratios for large group plans at 15 percent. That has required insurance carriers to rethink their business model because they\u2019ve still got to make money and pay expenses, so they\u2019ve done just about the only thing they can to compensate: raise premiums.\n\nTo help companies cope with the increase in health insurance premium costs, the Ohio Department of Insurance (ODI) has updated its 20-year-old regulations for everyone\u2019s advantage.\n\n\u201cWhen Ohio decided not to establish a state health insurance exchange, it created an opportunity to build a better mousetrap,\u201d says William F. Hutter, CEO of Sequent.\n\n\u201cThere had been legislation on Ohio\u2019s books that allowed an organization to form a multiple employer welfare arrangement, which can essentially bind employers together to form a way to provide health coverage. There is now an entity, which companies can join, that allows member companies to participate in a nonprofit health plan that creates a direct relationship between membership, premiums and expenses.\u201d\n\nSmart Business spoke with Hutter about how Ohio\u2019s new regulations create opportunities for employers to mitigate their health insurance expenses.\n\nWhat do you expect will happen to premiums in the coming years?\n\nThis year brings significant changes for small employers because all health insurance plans will need to meet ACA guidelines. Health insurance providers will need to produce pretty big numbers to maintain revenue under the ACA medical loss ratios, or they will need to skinny down operating expenses. They\u2019ll likely choose to increase insurance premiums.\n\nWhat options do businesses have to mitigate premium increases?\n\nODI realized it needed to update its regulations because the existing laws were out of touch with the new financial model of health insurance. It sponsored legislation along with other key participants that laid the groundwork for new rules that allow businesses to participate in a multiple employer welfare arrangement.\n\nOhio businesses can now enjoy greater transparency into their health insurance expenses that most health insurance carriers won\u2019t provide.\n\nThe multiple employer welfare arrangement has the potential to reward employers that monitor the health of their employees, provide wellness programs and incentivize employees to adopt healthier habits by reducing health insurance costs.\n\nThis model also creates transparency, allowing employers to see their health coverage expenses, understand why they\u2019re going up or down and take actions to positively affect the rates. These insurance pools offer economies of scale without pooling the risk. Each member company is in its own risk bucket.\n\nHow can companies take part in a multiple employer welfare arrangement?\n\nA company would need to work with an entity that manages a multiple employer welfare arrangement. The company\u2019s employees would complete a personal health care survey, which will provide a rating based on the health of the group.\n\nThe result is that the company pays for its own risk but the transparency allows a company to do something to lower its costs. Members of the health fund arrangement are incentivized to help employees be healthier \u2014by offering health screenings and wellness programs, for example \u2014 and healthier employees are generally more productive and have fewer absences.\n\nThis program makes the most sense for companies with 100 or fewer employees. Any company with more than 50 employees will experience the full impact of the ACA, which includes the administrative, regulatory and reporting requirements. Companies that join a multiple employer welfare arrangement can have much of that burden lifted.\n\nInsights HR Consulting is brought to you by Sequent", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Smart Business Magazine", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://www.sbnonline.com/article/changes-to-ohio-law-allows-employers-to-control-health-insurance-expenses/", "article_author_name": "Jayne Gest", "site_id": "75b6dd55541159703e2dcc47492301ad", "article_published_time": "2016-01-04T21:02:39+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-27T04:01:06+00:00", "keywords": "sequent, william f hutter, health insurance", "wp_version": "7.8.0.1"}, "description": "To help companies cope with the increase in health insurance premium costs, the Ohio Department of Insurance updated its 20-year-old regulations.", "og": {"site_name": "Smart Business Magazine", "description": "To help companies cope with the increase in health insurance premium costs, the Ohio Department of Insurance updated its 20-year-old regulations.", "title": "Changes to Ohio law allows employers to control health insurance expenses - Smart Business Magazine", "locale": "en_US", "url": "http://www.sbnonline.com/article/changes-to-ohio-law-allows-employers-to-control-health-insurance-expenses/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/SmartBusiness/", "tag": "William F Hutter"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Ohio businesses can now enjoy greater transparency into their health insurance expenses that most health insurance carriers won\u2019t provide.\nThis year brings significant changes for small employers because all health insurance plans will need to meet ACA guidelines.\nTo help companies cope with the increase in health insurance premium costs, the Ohio Department of Insurance (ODI) has updated its 20-year-old regulations for everyone\u2019s advantage.\n\u201cWhen Ohio decided not to establish a state health insurance exchange, it created an opportunity to build a better mousetrap,\u201d says William F.
