Scientists develop a new vaccine each year based on what strains of the virus are circulating and predictions on how they may mutate, with varying degrees of success. The small amount of virus found so far in the U.S., and the higher levels overseas, look very much like what was used to build the vaccine, Bresee said. That typically means the vaccine is more effective, he said. There is still time for those who haven't get been vaccinated to do so.
