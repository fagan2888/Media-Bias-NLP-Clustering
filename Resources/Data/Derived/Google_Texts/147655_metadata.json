When patients have this kind of rash, public health officials have long instructed doctors to prescribe a regimen of antibiotics \u2014 and to have the patients undergo a battery of blood tests to determine the presence of certain antibodies.\n\nNot all doctors do this.\n\nAnd even when they do, inaccurate diagnoses abound.\n\nAs New Yorker magazine reported in 2013, \u201cIt takes weeks, and sometimes longer, for blood tests to detect antibodies; a test taken too soon will produce negative results. Even then, many people who become infected will test negative in error, while others who aren't infected will test positive.\u201d\n\nOh, and to further confound doctors and patients: Researchers have found evidence that suggests even when patients are aggressively treated and test bacteria-free, they still may experience illnesses and pain related to the original infection.\n\nAmong the late-stage symptoms of Lyme disease that can be present months or even years after the initial transmission: Confusion/disorientation, numbness, painful joints/ arthritis, dizziness/vertigo, tremors/ shakes, heart palpitations and intermittent amnesia. And lest you think only those in the Northeast are at risk for Lyme disease, think again.\n\nNot only does the CDC rank Florida in the top 20 states reporting cases of Lyme disease, but the Florida Lyme Disease Association notes, \u201cPeople are at risk for Lyme disease in Florida year-round.\u201d\n\nSo, what can you do to decrease your vulnerability?\n\nThe CDC recommends the following:\n\nUse repellents containing 20 percent or more DEET on your exposed skin and clothing.\n\nShower within two hours of being outdoors.\n\nCheck daily for ticks on your body \u2014 and on pets.\n\nRemove any ticks immediately with tweezers; ticks need more than 24 hours to transmit Lyme disease and related infections.\n\nOf course, no matter how vigilant you are, the fact remains that, as tick-borne disease specialist Dr. Erica Lehman told People magazine, \u201cLyme disease is the fastest-growing epidemic in the world.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Steve Dorfman, The Palm Beach Post", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/09/1003411770-FL_SAR_HFQA08.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "Not only does the CDC rank Florida in the top 20 states reporting cases of Lyme disease, but the Florida Lyme Disease Association notes, \u201cPeople are at risk for Lyme disease in Florida year-round.\u201dSo, what can you do to decrease your vulnerability?\nRemove any ticks immediately with tweezers; ticks need more than 24 hours to transmit Lyme disease and related infections.\nAnd lest you think only those in the Northeast are at risk for Lyme disease, think again.\nThe most widely known early symptom \u2014 the so-called \u201cbull's-eye rash\u201d \u2014 is considered a telltale sign that a patient has Lyme disease.\nQ: Can you get Lyme disease in Florida?"}
