Instead, the ratio of the unemployment rate among blacks versus that among whites has been amazingly consistent \u2014 between 2 and 2.5 \u2013 for the 40 years that official data go back. In 1972, the jobless rate among African-Americans was 2.04 times that among whites. In 2013, the ratio was 2.02.\n\nBlack Unemployment Isn\u2019t Converging With White Unemployment Since the early 1970s, the unemployment rate among black Americans has been persistently around 2 to 2.5 times as high as that among whites, with no decisive improvement. Ratio of black unemployment rate to white unemployment rate x 2.50 2.00 1.50 1.00 2.02x 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2013 Ratio of black unemployment rate to white unemployment rate x 2.50 2.00 1.50 1.00 2.02x 1980 1990 2000 2013\n\nHow much of this is caused by differing educational levels of black workers versus white workers, given that people with advanced education have sharply lower jobless rates than those without? Only some of it is.\n\nEven among people with similar levels of education, the black unemployment rate is higher. There was a 5.7 percent unemployment rate among African-Americans with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher in 2013, compared with 3.5 percent among white Americans with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. Indeed, joblessness is higher among blacks in every education level tracked by the Labor Department.\n\nBlack Unemployment Rates Are Higher Regardless of Education Even among people with comparable levels of education, jobless rates are very different among races. White Black Less than a high school diploma High school graduate, no college Some college or associate degree Bachelor's degree or higher 9.7% 6.6% 5.6% 3.5% 20.5% 12.6% 9.8% 5.7% White Black No high school diploma High school graduate Some college Bachelor\u2019s degree 9.7% 6.6% 5.6% 3.5% 20.5% 12.6% 9.8% 5.7%\n\nMoreover, while the proportion of blacks getting a college degree has risen sharply over the last generation, the proportion of whites doing the same has risen even more.\n\nAccording to census data analyzed by two Harvard economists, Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz, 21 percent of black 30-year-olds had a college degree in 2012, compared with 38 percent of white 30-year-olds. The 17 percentage point gap between those two numbers is considerably wider than the 10 percentage point gap in 1970.\n\nThe Race Gap in Higher Education Has Widened Percentage of 30 year\u2013olds with a college degree % 30 20 10 0 White Black 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2012 Percentage of 30 year\u2013olds with a college degree % 30 20 10 0 White Black 1970 1980 1990 2000 2012\n\nThere is better news to be seen in the types of jobs workers of different races are doing. A rising proportion of the nation\u2019s white-collar professionals are African-American. Some 7.4 percent of managers and executives were black in 2013, up from 5.7 percent in 1990, and the ratio of professionals like lawyers and engineers who are black had risen to 9.3 from 6.7 percent.\n\nA Disparity in the Workplace Black people are underrepresented in high\u2013income fields like business, law and medicine, and overrepresented in lower\u2013income jobs like food preparation and driving. Percentage of workers who are black % 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 Construction workers Managers and executives Professionals (like lawyers and engineers) Salespeople Service workers (such as cooks and cleaners) Drivers and movers All workers 1990 2000 2010 2013 Percentage of workers who are black % 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 Construction workers Managers and executives Professionals (like lawyers or engineers) Salespeople Service workers Drivers and movers Labor force \u201990 \u201900 \u201910 \u201913\n\nStill, blacks are underrepresented in these jobs, and overrepresented in low-skilled jobs. That might be one reason why the rise of a black professional class has not been sufficient to reduce the overall income gap between white and black workers. That gap, if anything, is widening. In 1983, the median weekly pay of white workers was 18.4 percent higher than that of black workers. Three decades later, the premium had risen to 21.6 percent.\n\nThe Racial Pay Gap The pay gap between white and black workers has widened over time. Median weekly earnings of full\u2013time wage and salary workers $800 600 400 200 0 White Black 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2013 Median weekly earnings of full\u2013time wage and salary workers $800 600 400 200 0 White Black 1980 1990 2000 2013\n\nThe differences in levels of wealth are even more striking. For two people with similar incomes, the level of wealth they accumulate can vary widely, depending on whether they received an inheritance or other help from parents; whether they had to take on student debts or other loans, and how aggressively they save and invest, among other factors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd this gap has widened during the last recession and the slow recovery since then, according to an analysis of Federal Reserve data by the Urban Institute. The researchers found that white families were 4.3 times as wealthy as black and Hispanic families in 2007. By 2010, the multiple had widened to 6.1.\n\nThe Wealth Gap Is Far Wider Than the Income Gap Incomes of white Americans have been consistently around twice that of black and Hispanic Americans. But the wealth gap is far wider, and minority families were particularly hard hit by the 2008 recession, so by 2010 white families had more than six times the wealth. x 6 4 2 0 Ratio of white wealth to black and Hispanic wealth Ratio of white income to black and Hispanic income 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 x 6 4 2 0 Ratio of white wealth to black and Hispanic wealth Ratio of white income to black and Hispanic income 1990 2000 2010\n\nAs a result, African-American families have less of a cushion to protect themselves if they encounter a financial setback, such as being laid off or encountering an unexpected health problem.\n\nPoverty, by contrast, offers a glass-half-empty/glass-half-full picture. The good news is that the proportion of blacks living below the poverty line has fallen in a meaningful way over the last generation, to 27.2 percent in 2012 from 32.5 percent in 1980.\n\nBut the bad news is that 27.2 percent is an astronomical level of poverty, more than double the 12.7 percent level among whites (which has ticked up a couple of percentage points in the same span).\n\nThe Poverty Rate Among Blacks Has Fallen Proportion of population living below the poverty line % 30 20 10 0 White Black 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2012 Proportion of population living below the poverty line % 30 20 10 0 White Black 1980 1990 2000 2012\n\nLower incomes and wealth coincide with greater health problems. For example, 19.6 percent of blacks were diagnosed as having diabetes from 2007 to 2010, compared with 9.5 percent of whites. A similar pattern appears with a range of serious health problems.\n\nBlacks Have Higher Rates of Stroke, Diabetes and Child Obesity White Black Diabetes Child obesity Heart disease Cancer (all types) Stroke 9.5% 6.4% 10.8% 6.1% 2.3% 19.6% 14.7% 10.7% 4.9% 4.1% White Black Diabetes Child obesity Heart disease Cancer (all types) Stroke 9.5% 6.4% 10.8% 6.1% 2.3% 19.6% 14.7% 10.7% 4.9% 4.1%\n\nHealth disparities between people of different races are thought to arise from a number of factors, including poverty; health-insurance rates; housing stock; access to grocery stores and parks; and discrimination in how people of different races are treated by medical professionals.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore blacks than whites had no usual source of health care as recently as 2011-2012. It remains to be seen how the health law now being put into place might change that equation.\n\nThe law is likely to help large numbers of blacks, but many living in states that have chosen not to expand Medicaid will remain without coverage.\n\nThe Proportion of Blacks Without Health Insurance Has Declined Even before full implementation of the Affordable Care Act, the proportion of black Americans without health insurance has shrunk in recent decades, while the proportion of whites without it has risen. Percentage of population without health insurance % 20 15 10 White Black 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 Percentage of population without health insurance % 20 15 10 White Black 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2012\n\nWhile the disparity in health is stark, there are some signs of improvement. Life expectancy has risen for people of both races over the last six decades. While newly born white children are still expected to live longer, the gap has narrowed considerably over recent decades, raising the prospect that the racial health gap will become less pronounced over time.\n\nThe Racial Gap in Life Expectancy Is Shrinking Life expectancy at birth 80 75 70 65 60 White Black 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 Life expectancy at birth 80 75 70 65 60 White Black 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010\n\nIn 1950, white newborns had a life expectancy that was 8.3 years longer than that of black newborns. By 2010 that had narrowed to 3.8, according to the Centers for Disease Control.\n\nBut there is one area of health that speaks directly to the tension in Ferguson, Mo., and where progress has been slower in coming: homicides.\n\nHomicide rates have come down across the board since the 1970s, so a smaller proportion of people of all races and ages are killed in any given year. But among young black men, death at the hand of someone else remains a threat to a degree it is not among any other subgroup of the population.\n\nAbout 76 out of every 100,000 black men between ages 25 and 34 were killed in a homicide in 2010, more than nine times the rate among white men in the same age group and 14 times the rate of the U.S. population as a whole.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140819125121, "twitter": {"description": "Despite progress since the days of Jim Crow, black Americans remain at a disadvantage in a variety of ways.", "title": "America\u2019s Racial Divide, Charted", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/20/upshot/americas-racial-divide-charted.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003063162"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/20/upshot/20up-race-chart1-1408460834755/20up-race-chart1-1408460834755-thumbLarge.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/20/upshot/americas-racial-divide-charted.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003063162", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/20/upshot/americas-racial-divide-charted.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "upshot", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Aug. 19, 2014", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "keywords": "Race and Ethnicity,Blacks,Unemployment,Murders and Attempted Murders,United States", "news_keywords": "Blacks African-Americans,Unemployment", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Neil Irwin, Claire Cain Miller and Margot Sanger-Katz", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/20/upshot/20up-race-chart1-1408460834755/20up-race-chart1-1408460834755-thumbLarge.png", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By NEIL IRWIN, CLAIRE CAIN MILLER and MARGOT SANGER-KATZ", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Despite progress since the days of Jim Crow, black Americans remain at a disadvantage in a variety of ways.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/20/upshot/20up-race-chart1-1408460834755/20up-race-chart1-1408460834755-thumbStandard.png", "description": "Despite progress since the days of Jim Crow, black Americans remain at a disadvantage in a variety of ways.", "CG": "upshot", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Aug. 19, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/margot_sangerkatz/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/upshot", "section": "The Upshot", "modified": "2015-01-19", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "tag": "United States", "published": "2014-08-19", "section-taxonomy-id": "D64FAE4C-4425-4E5A-B898-6C8CB59F9957"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "United States", "slug": "20up-race", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150119112207, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/20/upshot/americas-racial-divide-charted.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/20/upshot/20up-race-chart1-1408460834755/20up-race-chart1-1408460834755-videoSixteenByNine1050.png", "type": "article", "description": "Despite progress since the days of Jim Crow, black Americans remain at a disadvantage in a variety of ways.", "title": "America\u2019s Racial Divide, Charted"}, "pdate": 20140819, "des": "Murders and Attempted Murders", "articleid": 100000003063162, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "America\u2019s Racial Divide, Charted", "col": "Persistent Inequality", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "In 1983, the median weekly pay of white workers was 18.4 percent higher than that of black workers.\nEven among people with similar levels of education, the black unemployment rate is higher.\nThe Racial Pay Gap The pay gap between white and black workers has widened over time.\nBlack Unemployment Rates Are Higher Regardless of Education Even among people with comparable levels of education, jobless rates are very different among races.\nLet\u2019s look at the numbers:Through economic booms and busts, the unemployment rate has been persistently higher for African-Americans than for whites across the decades."}
