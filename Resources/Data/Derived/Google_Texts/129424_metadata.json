It also exists in the private sector. FedEx has long been one of the biggest offenders. Its drivers are technically independent contractors, although the shipping company dictates almost every part of their job. In doing so, FedEx unloads significant costs onto their workers, including money for the truck, equipment and uniform. Luckily, this swindle could be slowly nearing its end. Last week, drivers in California and Oregon received a big victory when an appeals court ruled that they were, in fact, employees, not independent contractors. FedEx says it will appeal the decisions, so these cases still have a long way to go. But the California and Oregon rulings were a step in the right direction.\n\nIn the meantime, New York provides an example for how regulators can reduce misclassification. In 2007, the state created a Joint Enforcement Task Force to conduct random investigations and impose harsh penalties on firms determined to be violating the law. McClatchy reports that the task force has recovered nearly $2 billion in lost wages since it began. Expanding such a program nationally would not be simple, but it will be vital to ensure that workers receive fair treatment in the future. After all, a survey released Thursday found that 21.1 Americans are independent contractors. If just 10 percent are misclassified, that\u2019s more than two million workers who aren\u2019t receiving the worker protections they deserve. That\u2019s unacceptable. And we shouldn\u2019t forget about them even as the economy improves.\n\n\u2014Danny Vinik\n\nNews from Thursday:\n\nHALBIG: The D.C.
