Yeah, this “fix” is gonna be great! Nancy Pelosi’s feeling super-confident:

On Obamacare, Nancy Pelosi tells reporters: "Everything will be under control by tomorrow afternoon." — Chris Moody (@moody) November 14, 2013

Nancy Pelosi on Obamacare fixes: "They'll be worked through and we'll be sailing." — Chris Moody (@moody) November 14, 2013

Pelosi on Obamacare and House Dems: "There is no disagreement in our caucus. We have to have a fix." — Chris Moody (@moody) November 14, 2013

More Pelosi on Obamacare "We'll be good, we'll be good. We'll do what we have to do, and that's what we'll do." — Chris Moody (@moody) November 14, 2013

“And that’s what we’ll do.”

"We'll be good," Pelosi says when asked whether the administrative fix to ACA will calm restive Democrats. "We're all of one mind." — Caitlin Huey-Burns (@CHueyBurnsRCP) November 14, 2013

One mind. Don’t you feel better now, America?

Pelosi says House Dems will propose their own legislative Obamacare fix to vote on Friday. More details after they meet this afternoon. — Chris Moody (@moody) November 14, 2013

The sun’ll come out tomorrow.

Happy days are here again! Wheeeee! "@eriContrarian: The best part of all of this is Pelosi saying everything will be fixed by tomorrow." — Sean Agnew (@seanagnew) November 14, 2013

All is weeeelllllllllll!

Update:

Another smart take from Nancy:

Pelosi said Obama's ACA fix & the House Dem legislative fix are like belts & suspenders. I don't have enough characters to explain it here. — Chris Moody (@moody) November 14, 2013

That’s OK. There aren’t enough characters in the world to make her sound coherent.
