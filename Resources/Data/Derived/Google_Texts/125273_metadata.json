Boy meets girl, falls in love, marries her, argues with her and ultimately leaves her. And that\u2019s exactly what the audience gets in this play. Well, partially.\n\nThe main thing that makes \u201cThe Last Five Years\u201d different is that it has both a linear and non-linear narrative comprised of dueling monologues \u2014 his moving forward in time, from the beginning of the relationship to the end, hers moving backwards, from the end to the beginning with the two progressions intersecting at the couple\u2019s wedding. Therefore, the audience knows that the relationship falls apart in the first minute of the show with the woman\u2019s opening song. It\u2019s a show not about anticipating or wondering what happens next but a piece that delves deeply into the complexities of modern relationships. The show is almost entirely musical, with each song presenting a snapshot of the relationship at different moments in its development.\n\nWith a minimalist set and a three-piece band, Footlight Players\u2019 production undoubtedly pulls off this structure with power and emotion. The two local actors were so on point that it became almost difficult to watch at times \u2014 it was often too realistic and painfully relatable. But then again, it\u2019s hard to take your eyes off these dynamic actors.\n\nRebecca Weatherby, a choral music education major at Charleston Southern University, plays Cathy Hiatt, a struggling actor who feels neglected by her husband\u2019s successful writing career. The strongest aspect of Weatherby\u2019s performance is her voice which rivals, and perhaps outshines, that of Broadway veteran Sherie Rene Scott\u2019s on the original cast recording. Weatherby is appropriately subtle and sad in the show\u2019s opening song, \u201cStill Hurting,\u201d and then jaw-droppingly intense as she belts out her frustrations in her second song, \u201cSee I\u2019m Smiling.\u201d She\u2019s hilarious and playful in the comedic \u201cA Summer in Ohio\u201d and tragically hopeful in the show\u2019s closing number \u201cGoodbye Until Tomorrow.\u201d\n\nCaleb Copper plays Jamie Wellerstein, who early on gets the \u201csingular impression things are moving too fast\u201d in both his career and love life. Copper portrays the excited and naive 23-year-old with perfect lightness; his conflicted 28-year-old is somehow the most heartbreaking and touching of the two characters, even if Cathy is more the victim of the relationship\u2019s demise. His best scene is midway through the show when Jamie encourages Cathy to pursue her acting career through an imaginative telling of a story he\u2019s written, \u201cThe Schmuel Song.\u201d\n\nEven for the theatergoer who typically stays away from musicals, this show is a Piccolo must-see. (Unless you are going to the theater to escape your marital problems, in which case, maybe not.) The show is certainly not a form of escapism and you won\u2019t leave feeling any happier than you did before you arrived. It\u2019s more a lesson on perspective, a reminder that everyone has a story.\n\nThe show continues at 8 p.m. June 3, 4, 5 and 6 at Footlight Players Theatre, 20 Queen St. Tickets are $25 for adults, $20 for seniors and military, $17 for students.
