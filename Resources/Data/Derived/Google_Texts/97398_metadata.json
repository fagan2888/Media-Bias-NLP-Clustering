As part of a public service announcement for the Center for Reproductive Rights, Kirke explained the details of her own abortion in hopes of lifting the stigma surrounding a woman\u2019s own reproductive choices.\n\n\"We think we do have free choice and we are able to do whatever we want, but then there are these little hoops we have to jump through to get them,\" Kirke explained in the PSA. \"I\u2019ve always felt that reproductive issues should be something that women especially should be able to talk about freely, especially amongst each other, and I still see that today. I still see shame and embarrassment around terminating pregnancy and getting pregnant.\"\n\nKirke \u2014 who is currently the mother of two daughters, ages 4 and 8 \u2014 explained that her pregnancy in 2007 came at a time when \u201craising a healthy, happy child\u201d was just not possible. Although the couple was able to raise enough money for the abortion, funding the anesthesia for the procedure was another matter entirely. Kirke refused to tell her parents about the pregnancy and her decision, so she decided to go through with the procedure without anesthesia.\n\nKirke added that by sharing her story she hopes that one day her daughters won\u2019t have to worry about protecting their own reproductive rights. \"I'm already anticipating their issues with self-esteem, their body, the whole luggage that comes with being a woman,\" Kirke said. \"And so I would love if when they're older, the political issues surrounding their bodies were not there anymore.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "girls, actress, jemima, kirke, reveals, 2007, abortion, without, anesthesia, new, reproductive", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "\u201cGirls\u201d actress Jemima Kirke talks openly about her 2007 abortion to help lift the stigma surrounding reproductive rights.", "title": "'Girls' Actress Reveals 2007 Abortion In Hopes Of Lifting The Stigma [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/girls-actress-jemima-kirke-reveals-2007-abortion-without-anesthesia-new-reproductive-329468", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/04/15/girls-actress-jemima-kirke-reveals-2007-abortion-without-anesthesia-new-reproductive.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cGirls\u201d actress Jemima Kirke talks openly about her 2007 abortion to help lift the stigma surrounding reproductive rights.", "title": "'Girls' Actress Reveals 2007 Abortion In Hopes Of Lifting The Stigma [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/girls-actress-jemima-kirke-reveals-2007-abortion-without-anesthesia-new-reproductive-329468", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/04/15/girls-actress-jemima-kirke-reveals-2007-abortion-without-anesthesia-new-reproductive.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/15/girls-actress-jemima-kirke-reveals-2007-abortion-without-anesthesia-new-reproductive.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-04-15T17:17:07-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-16T11:40:46-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "\u201cGirls\u201d actress Jemima Kirke talks openly about her 2007 abortion to help lift the stigma surrounding reproductive rights."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd12d6\"", "article_summary": "\"And so I would love if when they're older, the political issues surrounding their bodies were not there anymore.\"\nAs part of a public service announcement for the Center for Reproductive Rights, Kirke explained the details of her own abortion in hopes of lifting the stigma surrounding a woman\u2019s own reproductive choices.\n\u201cGirls\u201d actress and artist Jemima Kirke recently talked about an abortion she had in 2007 following an unexpected pregnancy with her college boyfriend.\nKirke added that by sharing her story she hopes that one day her daughters won\u2019t have to worry about protecting their own reproductive rights.\n\"I\u2019ve always felt that reproductive issues should be something that women especially should be able to talk about freely, especially amongst each other, and I still see that today."}
