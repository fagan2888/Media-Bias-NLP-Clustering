Sonja Sharp for The Wall Street Journal\n\nA black bear cub was found dead Monday in Central Park, officials said.\n\nA Central Park Conservancy worker found the deceased cub under a bush near W. 69th St. and West Drive Monday morning, a New York City Police Department spokeswoman said.\n\nThe employee called 911, and officers from the 22nd precinct responded, she said. The NYPD\u2019s Animal Cruelty Squad is now investigating the matter, she added.\n\nThe Central Park Conservancy, which confirmed the discovery, said it was extremely unusual.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always alarmed and distraught when any wildlife is injured,\u201d spokeswoman Elizabeth Kaledin said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if it was injured in Central Park.\u201d\n\nShe described the discovery site as a crime scene and referred further inquiries to the NYPD.\n\nThe bear cub was about 3 feet long and apparently not from the zoo, since no bears are missing, a law-enforcement official said. The creature suffered some trauma and has lacerations on its side. While authorities initially said the Bronx Zoo would conduct a necropsy, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation is taking possession of the animal, officials said. The creature will be taken to Albany to a wildlife pathology unit for the necropsy.\n\nMarianne Sponholz, 63, a volunteer with the Central Park Conservancy, was on her way home through the park when she noticed the cordoned off area. When she heard about the bear, she was \u201cshocked.\u201d\n\n\u201cI work in this zone and we\u2019ve never found a bear cub,\u201d she said. \u201cThey do find rats, occasionally a cat, but a bear cub, no.\u201d\n\nDog walker John McKinley, 59, was also taken aback. \u201cIt makes me think there\u2019s a sick person who could dump a bear cub in the park,\u201d he said. \u201cDogs are off leash before 9 a.m. \u2014 they could come up to it and it might be diseased.\u201d\n\nLucas Altman, 43, who lives across the street, said he was walking his black Labradors around 11 p.m. Sunday night when they both ran over to the bush where the bear was later found. One of them, Sam, eventually walked away, but another, named Nash, stuck around the bush.\n\n\u201cThey smelled something in the bushes around 11 o\u2019clock,\u201d Mr. Altman said. \u201c[The detective] said it was very helpful because they\u2019re trying to figure out a timeline.\u201d\n\nPervaiz Shallwani contributed to this article\n\nCorrections & amplifications: In an earlier version of this article, Marianne Sponholz\u2019s name was misspelled.\n\nA photo of the bear under a bush in Central Park.
