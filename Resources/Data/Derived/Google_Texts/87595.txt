With his next career move up in the air, former Nuggets guard Chauncey Billups recently visited Nuggets president Josh Kroenke and general manager Tim Connelly at the Pepsi Center.

The visit, according to sources, was described as a wide-ranging chat.

With Billups’ recent release from the Detroit Pistons and a 17-year playing career winding down, it would not be a surprise if the Nuggets broached the subject of him joining the team’s front office at some point in the future. Billups has not yet announced his retirement as a player. He has indicated in the past he would like to be an NBA executive once his playing days are over.

Billups, however, still might have options on the court.

He’s an unrestricted free agent, and with the LeBron James decision out of the way, players will start signing quickly across the league. Once that signing flurry is over, Billups should have a much clearer indication of teams that might be interested in adding a veteran leader such as himself. So, playing one more season isn’t out of the question.

For a team to sign him he’ll have to prove he’s healthy. Billups has missed the majority of each of the past three seasons with various injuries. He’s said in numerous interviews that he’s got nothing left to prove on the court, but wouldn’t mind attaching himself to a winning team for one more title run. And, he’d like to leave the NBA on his own terms.

Whenever he’s done as a player, he’s expected to transition right into his next career as an executive.
