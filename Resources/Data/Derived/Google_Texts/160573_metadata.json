Today about 70 percent of student carry student debt, compared to 45 percent in 1993.\n\nEconomists suggest the rising outstanding student debt\u2014which topped $1.2 trillion in 2013 -- has adversely affected consumer behavior -- prompting some young people to delay making large purchases on things like cars and houses.\n\n\u201cHaving student debt can affect major life choices such as starting a home or saving for retirement,\u201d said Lauren Asher, the president of the Institute for College Access & Success.\n\nA recent analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2019s Liberty Street Economics blog suggests student loans are already hampering the housing market\u2014a major driver of the economy. The study found that a smaller portion of 30-year-olds have mortgages than any other time in more than a decade.\n\nAbout 22.3 percent of people ages 27 to 30 without student debt had mortgages, one percentage point higher than those paying back college loans. That\u2019s compared to 2011, when a quarter of people in both groups had home loans, the analysis found.\n\nResearchers caution that there are a number of reasons contributing to the decline in young homeowners\u2014including limited access to credit, lowered expectations for earnings and the job market. Asher suggested that even the perceptions of housing as an investment might be very different among this generation of young people.\n\nRelated: How Gov\u2019t Student Loans Ruined College Education\n\nA separate study by Pew Research found that college grads under 40 with student debt have a significantly lower median net worth than those who didn\u2019t take out college loans. The average net worth of graduates with student debt is just $8,700 compared to $64,700 for the same group without college loans.\n\nThe study also found that people who had student debt were also more likely to have other forms of debt like credit card debt and car loans. College grads under 40 with student loans had an average total debt of $137,010, compared to $73,250 for those carrying debt without student loans.\n\n\u201cCollege grads with student loans are benefiting from higher incomes because of their degrees, but about four in 10 borrowers are weighed down with a substantial amount of debt that extends beyond student loan debt,\u201d Richard Fry at Pew said.\n\nStill, despite the spate of studies highlighting how many people are saddled with student debt, education experts say the climbing cost of college far outweighs the alternative of not going.\n\nRelated: 11 Things You Didn\u2019t Know About Student Loans\n\n\u201cData confirm over and over that college, on average, is the best investment you can make in your life,\u201d Asher said. However, she cautioned that there is a wide variation on student borrower outcomes\u2014for instance, it depends on how much a student borrows and whether or not they complete school. \u201cIt\u2019s important that if you do need to borrow you borrow in the safest way,\u201d she said.\n\nA Pew research poll from earlier this year found that the median income for a household headed by a graduate under 40 is $57,941\u2014twice the average $32,538 for those not holding a bachelor\u2019s degree.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "When graduates of the class of 2014 accept their diplomas this year they will leave th", "title": "Congrats Class of 2014\u2026for Being the Most Indebted Class Ever", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/05/19/Congrats-Class-2014-Being-Most-Indebted-Class-Ever", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06062013_student_debt_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/05/19/Congrats-Class-2014-Being-Most-Indebted-Class-Ever", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06062013_student_debt_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "When graduates of the class of 2014 accept their diplomas this year they will leave th", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Today about 70 percent of student carry student debt, compared to 45 percent in 1993.\nCollege grads under 40 with student loans had an average total debt of $137,010, compared to $73,250 for those carrying debt without student loans.\nAbout 22.3 percent of people ages 27 to 30 without student debt had mortgages, one percentage point higher than those paying back college loans.\nThe average net worth of graduates with student debt is just $8,700 compared to $64,700 for the same group without college loans.\nA recent analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2019s Liberty Street Economics blog suggests student loans are already hampering the housing market\u2014a major driver of the economy."}
