Former starter Geno Smith threw for 265 yards and two TD passes in his first action since losing the job in training camp after getting punched in the locker room by teammate IK Enemkpali.\n\nSmith then left in the closing minute on a hard hit by Ray-Ray Armstrong. Fitzpatrick returned despite the injury and threw two passes before Smith returned.\n\nGetting beaten by Tom Brady and New England last week might not have been a cause for alarm, but the Jets were even worse this week against the emerging Raiders offense that has put together back-to-back stellar performances behind a second-year quarterback.\n\nAfter scoring on the first seven drives in last week\u2019s 37-29 win at San Diego, the Raiders were once again almost perfect on offense at the start. Carr threw touchdown passes on the first drives as the Raiders controlled the line of scrimmage and broke numerous tackles in the secondary. Oakland didn\u2019t punt until the fourth quarter.\n\nCarr was helped out by his receivers making big gains after the catch with Crabtree breaking tackles from Demario Davis, Antonio Cromartie and Marcus Williams on his 36-yard touchdown and Jones running around and through half the Jets defense on his long score.\n\nBut Carr also showed the ability to throw the deep ball, connecting on a 49-yarder to Holmes that made it 21-3 late in the first half. Carr now has seven TD passes and no interceptions the past two weeks and is just the third Raiders quarterback to throw for 300 or more yards with four touchdowns and no interceptions since the merger. Rich Gannon did it in 2002 and Jeff Hostetler in 1994.\n\nFitzpatrick got hurt scrambling in the opening drive of the game. Smith came on and led the Jets to a field goal, but then threw an interception to Woodson and did not get the Jets into the end zone until midway through the third quarter with Oakland already up 28-6.\n\nSmith also took a hard hit by David Amerson that drew \u201coohs and ahhs\u201d from the crowd after a 29-yard run down the sideline.\n\nHe didn\u2019t get much help from the running game. Chris Ivory, who came into the game averaging more than 100 yards a game, was held to 17 yards on 15 carries behind a line missing starting center Nick Mangold.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Derek Carr throws 4 TD passes to lead Raiders past Jets 34-20", "title": "Derek Carr throws 4 TD passes to lead Raiders past Jets 34-20", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/01/derek-carr-throws-4-td-passes-to-lead-raiders-past-jets-34-20/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151101_055453_derek-carr-1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151101_055453_derek-carr-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-01T17:44:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T03:08:19+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Carr threw touchdown passes on the first drives as the Raiders controlled the line of scrimmage and broke numerous tackles in the secondary.\nOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 Derek Carr and the high-powered Oakland offense have the Raiders \u2014 after a dozen years of losing \u2014 back into contention in the AFC for a change.\nCarr threw for 333 yards and four touchdowns to help Oakland pick apart the New York Jets\u2019 vaunted defense in a 34-20 victory Sunday that put the Raiders in the thick of the playoff race.\nRyan Fitzpatrick left with a left hand injury on the opening drive for the Jets (4-3), who have lost two straight games.\nFitzpatrick returned despite the injury and threw two passes before Smith returned."}
