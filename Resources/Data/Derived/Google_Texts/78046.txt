Soon after our story describing the challenges for Colorado as hundreds of thousands of Medicaid patients seek newly available dental benefits in the coming year, the Colorado Health Institute has further sharpened the picture of what problem lie ahead.

We mentioned in our story that a handful of counties in Colorado have no dentist at all, and the CHI report gives us a map of those now-eight counties. But they add in another challenging layer, those counties whose only available dental care is at federally qualified health clinics. That care is certainly far better than none at all, but it is also limited, and the combined territories cover wide swaths of Colorado.
