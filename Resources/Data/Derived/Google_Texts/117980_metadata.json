The man surrendered and was taken into custody. Many Americans talked about his act of domestic terrorism, and in addition to the people who were held by him and hiding in the Planned Parenthood clinic, many are now likely fearful of accessing the important health care and legal services Planned Parenthood provides.\n\n\"We don't yet know the full circumstances and motives behind this criminal action, and we don't yet know if Planned Parenthood was in fact the target of this attack,\" Vicki Cowart, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, said in a statement, CNN reported.\n\n\"We share the concerns of many Americans that extremists are creating a poisonous environment that feeds domestic terrorism in this country. We will never back away from providing care in a safe, supportive environment that millions of people rely on and trust.\"\n\nWas it domestic terrorism?\n\n\"Domestic terrorism includes acts within the territorial U.S. that are dangerous to human life, violate federal or state criminal laws, have no actual connection to international terrorists, and appear to be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, influence domestic government policy through intimidation or coercion, or affect the conduct of our government by mass destruction, assassination or kidnapping,\" the U.S. Dept. Of Justice website states.\n\n\"Current domestic terrorism threats include animal rights extremists, eco-terrorists, anarchists, antigovernment extremists such as 'sovereign citizens' and unauthorized militias, Black separatists, White supremacists, anti-abortion extremists, and other unaffiliated disaffected Americans, including 'lone wolfs.' Domestic terrorism cases often involve firearms, arson or explosive offenses, crimes relating to fraud, and threats and hoaxes.\"\n\nRepublicans for months have been engaged in a fact-less attack on Planned Parenthood, fed by the debunked and discredited videos that purport to \"prove\" Planned Parenthood is selling baby parts. They're not, of course, but facts to the GOP are unimportant.\n\nFor months, Republican presidential candidates have used those videos and every other opportunity to weigh in on the women's health care provider \u2013 except today, when one man committed a horrific act of domestic terrorism.\n\nThat \u2013 including the deaths of three innocent people \u2013 went wholly ignored by every single GOP presidential candidate.\n\nWhat did the Republican presidential candidates talk about today instead?\n\nWell, while the attack was still in progress, three sent out tweets asking supporters to go shopping.\n\nStay warm this winter with our new cold-weather bundle.
