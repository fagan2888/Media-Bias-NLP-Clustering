If anyone could get Prince William on stage, of course it'd be country's sweetheart!

Taylor Swift's love for fun is infectious, and it looks like she infected Wills while visiting Kensington Palace for the Centrepoint Winter Whites Gala.

Kate Middleton's dashing hubby took to the stage with Swifty AND Jon Bon Jovi for a little sing-along of Livin' On a Prayer (below)! And Kate should be proud because her man did his thang!

Apparently we all shouldn't be so shocked about that because Swifty pointed out he's quite the regular, fun-loving guy once you get past the crown. She commented:

"[He] was really funny. So cool."

But it sounds like Wills almost got upstaged by the palace itself because it had Taylor under its spell as she added:

"It's positively magical here. There are fairy lights and there is fake snow falling from the sky and everything is just gorgeous. I am just very lucky to be here."

And we're just lucky someone caught the trio on video! Ch-ch-check it out (below)!
