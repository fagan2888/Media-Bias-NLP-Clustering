So far, the campaign has been very much a mixed bag, \u201cwith the Islamic State losing control of territory in some places while making gains in other,\u201d reported The Washington Post.\n\nRelated: The Merger of ISIS and al-Qaeda Could Cripple the Civilized World\n\nThe campaign will have \u201cperiods of progress and setbacks,\u201d Obama said during Tuesday\u2019s meeting of top military officials from the U.S. and 21 other countries during a strategy session at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland.\n\nYet a couple of new reports from The New York Times suggests that Obama\u2019s overall strategy for ultimately toppling the Islamic jihadist organization may be highly flawed \u2013 and that the U.S. may face even more formidable challenges from ISIS than it thought:\n\nFirst, an internal CIA study strongly suggests the president\u2019s plan to train moderate Syrian rebels to fight ISIS likely will not work and is just the latest of many failed efforts by the U.S. to arm and train foreign forces to combat American enemies. The report, which is still classified, was commissioned in 2012 and 2013, when the Obama administration was deliberating about whether to intervene in the Syrian civil war against President Bashar al-Assad.\n\n\n\nThe CIA study, presented in the White House Situation Room, documented a sorry rate of success in these tactics throughout the CIA\u2019s \u201c67-year history \u2013 from Angola to Nicaragua to Cuba,\u201d said The Times. Arguably the biggest fiasco was the 1961 Bay of Pigs operation in Cuba ordered by President John F. Kennedy, in which CIA-trained Cuban guerrillas mounted a doomed invasion to fight Fidel Castro\u2019s forces. And President Ronald Reagan suffered a major humiliation in the 1980s when the CIA tried and failed to topple Nicaragua\u2019s Sandinista government by secretly supporting the contra rebels.\n\n\n\nAfter nixing airstrikes on the Assad regime, Obama in April 2013 authorized the CIA to begin a program to arm and train moderate rebels at a base in Jordan. Obama recently decided to expand that mission with a much larger base in Saudi Arabia to train \u201cvetted\u201d rebels to fight ISIS in Syria.\n\n\n\nObama has been adamant about not deploying U.S. ground troops to Syria and Iraq to fight ISIS \u2013 so-called \u201cboots on the ground\u201d -- and insists it\u2019s up to the Iraqi Army and moderate Syrian rebels to take on that onerous assignment. But the study found that the CIA was \u201ceven less effective when the militias fought without any direct American support on the ground,\u201d said The Times. The only exception was \u201cwhen the CIA helped arm and train mujahedeen rebels fighting Soviet troops in Afghanistan during the 1980s.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated: How the U.S. Allowed ISIS to Form a Terrorist Army\n\nSecond, ISIS currently controls large areas of Iraq that are strewn with highly dangerous chemical weapons left over from the regime of Saddam Hussein, said The New York Times. President George W. Bush and Congress went to war in Iraq in 2003 declaring the U.S. must destroy active weapons of mass destruction. Though U.S. troops never found those weapons, they gradually stumbled across \u2013 and physically suffered from \u2013 the remnants of long-abandoned chemical weapons programs that had been built in collaboration with the West.\n\n\n\nDuring the long U.S. occupation of Iraq, American troops began finding highly eroded chemical munitions in hidden caches and roadside bombs, according to The Times. \u201cTypically 155-millimeter artillery shells or 122-millimeter rockets, they were remnants of an arms program Iraq had rushed into production in the 1980s during the Iran-Iraq war.\u201d Some soldiers and Marines were exposed to sarin gas and a mustard agent and suffered serious burns and eye and respiratory injuries.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated: Five Ways Climate Change Threatens National Security\n\nMany of the chemical weapons incidents occurred around the ruins of the Muthanna State Establishment near Baghdad, the heart of the Iraqi chemical agent production in the 1980s. Since June, that compound has been under ISIS control. \u201cThese encounters carry worrisome implications now that the Islamic State, a Qaeda splinter group, controls much of the territory where the weapons were found,\u201d said The Times.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "President Obama on Tuesday told coalition military officials from around the world that they\u2019ve had some \u201cimportant successes\u201d against ISIS, though this will be a long-term campaign with many ups and downs.
