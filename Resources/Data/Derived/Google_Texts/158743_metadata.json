The Mix-a-Monster creatures, hybrids of animals, crossbreeds that existed only in the imagination\u2026 They\u2019ve hatched, thanks to 3D printing technology and people\u2019s unlimited imaginations.\n\nThree winners from i.materialise\u2018s Mix-a-Monster Challenge have been announced, and the designs have been 3D printed. The challenge ran from September 3rd through October 29th, asking participants to \u201cRelease the monster inside you!\u201d using Autodesk Meshmixer. And now the results are in,and the three winners\u2019 designs are out.\n\nThe winners each received their designs 3D printed using i.materialise\u2019s Multicolor Gloss material, as well as a one-year membership for Autodesk 123D Premium. Additionally, all entrants received a 10% discount to print their designs via i.materialise.\n\nThe jury included the i.materialise team and Jesse Harrington Au, Maker Advocate-Autodesk Inc. From among a gallery of entries including a cowlion (or lioncow), a sea cow (dolphin/cow), and a pandenquin (panda/penguin), the three winners emerged.\n\nPresenting the winners:\n\nUniRabbit, BunnyBeetle, and Pigeal represent the three winning entries in the Mix-a-Monster Challenge, and I have to admit I\u2019m pretty happy I won\u2019t meet these little mixed up monsters on the street. One of the best things about 3D printing is that it truly posts no limits to the imagination, and can really bring works purely from the mind into the third dimension.\n\nThe contest\u2019s parameters specified that the final creatures had to be able to be printed using Mulitcolor Gloss, and so had to adhere to the material\u2019s design guide for use. Furthermore, it had to fit within a maximum volume of 250 cm\u00b3 with a total model volume of less than 60 cm\u00b3. Meshmixer has Analysis tools to check the dimensions.\n\nThe \u201cStability\u201d tool could be used to check both the model volume and the viability of the model to stand on its own (the stability of its base). Meshmixer could also be used to hollow out the models so they\u2019d fit within the specified design \u2014 a technique which also can save money on 3D printing costs, as less material is used. The \u201cInspector\u201d tool was the last one that needed to be checked, to ensure that it was a watertight solid.\n\nWhat do you think about these winning designs? Did you enter?
