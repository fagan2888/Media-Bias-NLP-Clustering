The group, celebrating its 25th year of harmonizing, is a favorite of Leno\u2019s.\n\nI told Lance my mom has been very concerned about how Leno will handle being replaced by Jimmy Fallon, whose first show was last night. Told him that Mother also spends lots of time worrying about the lives of those less fortunate.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Lance. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s doing too poorly. He\u2019s great. We actually worked with him the night after he finished his last night on the \u2018Tonight Show\u2019 and his wife, Mavis, was with him, too. She\u2019s made the comment: Well, once the show is done we hit the road.\n\n\u201cHe seems to be doing just fine,\u201d Lance said, though he did mention one troubling detail. \u201cExcept when he\u2019s on stage, he always wears, in the last twenty-something years we\u2019ve been working with him, the same denim shirt and jeans,\u201d Lance said, laughing. \u201cEvery picture we have with him, he\u2019s always got a denim shirt and jeans. He really is a good guy, a kind guy. He seems like he\u2019ll do OK.\n\n\u201cHowever, he seems to be a little more upbeat than the last time we saw him, like a couple years back. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s happy about it, but he\u2019s glad to be moving on,\u201d said Lance.\n\nRyan Lance of the Blenders said Leno seemed totally uninterested in doing more TV.\n\nSurely Fox is looking at giving another late-night show to Leno, who after all left NBC in the No. 1 spot.\n\n\u201cWe were speculating about that. There must have been some clause; NBC probably didn\u2019t want him to go to any other network so they probably paid him pretty well to do a noncompete,\u201d Lance said.\n\nHe said Leno seemed totally uninterested in doing more TV. \u201cThat\u2019s what he said,\u201d Lance said.\n\nAfter a couple of years of the unctuous if multitalented Fallon, who knows what frame of mind viewers and Leno may be in?\n\nMalfunction for unreal McCoy\n\nSometimes TV news anchors forget they\u2019re on camera because they are as comfortable in the studio as in their living rooms.\n\nThat\u2019s what I think happened Super Bowl eve when KARE 11 anchor Blake McCoy made a hand gesture in the direction of anchor Rena Sarigianopoulos intended to nearly re-enact the \u201cwardrobe malfunction\u201d brought to us by Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake.\n\n\u201cC.J. \u2014 did you see or hear about this inappropriate boob grab on the news last night??\u201d e-mailed English teacher Beth. \u201cThe last story of the newscast was a mention about the Timberlake-Jackson breast fiasco during the Super Bowl halftime show many years ago. After the report, Blake says to Rena Should we re-enact? and then he reaches over to her as if he is going to grab her breast. I was appalled, offended and am still (12 hours later) angry and in shock.\u201d\n\nI had forgotten about Beth\u2019s e-mail until a Strib colleague reminded me. I ordered a copy of the scene from Susan Krepps-Diamond at NorthStar Media Services, who sent over a courtesy clip with the note: \u201cHe just couldn\u2019t help himself \u2026 lol.\u201d\n\nI saw that Sarigianopoulos responded with a \u201cNo\u201d and a chuckle and some words undecipherable to me, as McCoy said, \u201cJust kidding.\u201d Sarigianopoulos appeared startled for about nine-sixteenths of a second, the time that Rena said 90 million got to view Jackson\u2019s pierced breast.\n\n\u201cI would never intentionally offend anyone. The infamous \u2018wardrobe malfunction\u2019 was 10 years ago and I thought the sensitivity over it had passed,\u201d McCoy told me via e-mail. \u201cWe laughed about it. It was a lighthearted moment at the end of a Saturday night newscast. Rena and I are good friends outside of work and that carries over on the air sometimes. I expected a tweet or two. Just not from you!\u201d\n\nC.J. can be reached at cj@startribune.com and seen on Fox 9\u2019s \u201cBuzz.\u201d E-mailers, please state a subject; \u201cHello\u201d does not count.
