The result will again be the nominees whom they want, and the president they want will be elected.\n\nThis is only possible because of the shameful, even if willful, political ignorance of the majority of American citizens. We don\u2019t know our own history, so we don\u2019t know what it was that made this nation unique, prosperous and powerful. We don\u2019t know that \u201cpolitician\u201d is not supposed to be a career, but a brief period in someone\u2019s life during which they serve their country instead of their own personal pursuits and agendas. We don\u2019t know what our Constitution says, so political hacks in both parties can make sweet-sounding promises to gain our ADHD attention and get us yukking it up and cheering, as if selecting who will be the most powerful person in the world is no more important than an Arsenio Hall show.\n\nTed Cruz was elected to the U.S. Senate as a Tea Party candidate. The Republican powers-that-be \u2013 long-serving Senators and Congressmen, big-money donors and the Karl Rove-type backroom operators \u2013 did all they could to defeat him, just as they did with the other Tea Party candidates (What\u2026you thought it was the Democrats? See what I mean about your ignorance?). While they were mostly successful, Cruz overcame their concerted efforts and won.\n\nThat made them dislike him from the get-go. What really made Mitch McConnell, John McCain, Rove, Boehner, et al, dislike him is that unlike most politicians of both parties, Cruz set about actually doing what he promised he\u2019d do in the Senate campaign. He opposed ObamaCare while other Republicans in the House and Senate made only token gestures, then supported it. He opposed giving amnesty to illegal aliens, even as some Republicans (Marco Rubio) authored legislation providing just that. Again and again, on issue after issue, Cruz fought for the things his constituents elected him to fight for, usually against other Republicans, and what did it get him?\n\nIt got him the \u201cloathing\u201d of the smarmy, slimy career politicos like limp-wristed Lindsay Graham, who joked that if someone shot Cruz on the Senate floor they wouldn\u2019t be able to find anyone to testify against the shooter. Or like McCain, whose corruption and amoral pandering rivals that of any politician in the past 50 years. Or Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader who (like John Boehner, the GOP Speaker of the House) gave the Democrats everything they wanted with little or no opposition, prompting Cruz to call him a liar on the Senate floor.\n\nCruz didn\u2019t run for the Senate to be buddies with that pack of rats; he went there to try and change things in Washington, and for that he is, indeed, \u201cwidely loathed\u201d\u2026but only by the politicians that have been screwing over Republican voters for decades! Oh, yeah\u2026and by the media who want to ensure control of the political process \u2013 even when the supposedly (but not in reality) \u201cconservative\u201d Republicans control Congress \u2013 by those of their own political beliefs.\n\nYou know\u2026liberal, leftist, quasi-socialist (with them always in the good graces, of course, of the \u201cleaders,\u201d whatever the party). So Cruz\u2019 faithfulness to his campaign promises (and, unlike the rest of them, to his oath of office!) revealed their hypocrisy and threatened their positions, so naturally they dislike him. But according to the media, it\u2019s \u201ceverybody\u201d who dislikes Ted Cruz, giving the American voters pause. \u201cWhere there\u2019s smoke, there must be fire,\u201d the media have you thinking, which means they win\u2026and we lose\u2026again.\n\nI\u2019m as mad or madder than anyone about the deceit and lies and continual betrayal of politicians who say one thing during campaigns but do another once in office. But I don\u2019t want a carnival showman, a bored billionaire tired of reality TV and looking for another game to play. I want a man who has stood by his campaign promises, knowing it would hurt him with his own party. A man who knows the Constitution like few others in Washington but who, unlike the majority, actually takes seriously his oath of office to support and defend those principles.\n\nWhen I got to Vietnam in 1968, \u201ceveryone\u201d in the unit warned me about a certain Gunnery Sergeant, telling me how everyone hated him and how mean he was. At age eighteen, I hadn\u2019t yet learned that you can sometimes tell the measure of a man by the character of those who don\u2019t like them, so I just took it as truth, even telling later arrivals the same thing. But during my 13 months in-country, I never saw him do anything unfair or mean to anyone. What he did was enforce the rules, and hold us to the high standards of the Marine Corps; in other words, he did his job. I gradually realized that the dislike for him stemmed from the loafers and shirkers who didn\u2019t like being made to do theirs.\n\nTed Cruz has earned the \u201cloathing\u201d of exactly the same kind of people, the career politicians in the Republican Party who don\u2019t want to do their jobs but who also don\u2019t want their cushy applecart upset by an outsider. They don\u2019t really fear a Trump win; they just want to make sure Cruz damages Trump enough so that Hillary\u2019s victory is assured. What?! Yes, your political ignorance is showing again: even if Hillary wins, you see, they keep their positions of power in the GOP, and their betrayal goes on as usual.\n\nTheir big fear is that Trump supporters will stop screaming long enough to realize he\u2019s just another (but more expensive) empty suit, and switch their support to Cruz. For if Cruz gets the nomination, even the media can\u2019t assure Hillary the victory, and a Cruz presidency means the GOP establishment is toast. That\u2019s why they \u201cloathe\u201d him. The media wants to help them defeat Cruz by continually repeating this \u201cwidely loathed\u201d claim because, after all, the GOP establishment offers zero opposition to the agenda of the Democrats\u2026which is the same agenda of 95% of the nation\u2019s media.\n\nNow that you know who it is who really \u201cloathes\u201d Ted Cruz\u2026doesn\u2019t it make you want to vote for him?\n\n\n\nThis article is printed with the permission of the author(s).
