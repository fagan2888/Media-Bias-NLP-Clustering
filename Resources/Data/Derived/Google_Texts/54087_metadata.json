Michelle Bachmann turned a question about recent federal court gay marriage rulings into a clinic on constitutional law Wednesday \u2013 as well as a grade-school lesson on human biology.\n\nGohmert and Bachmann were speaking with Rep. Steve King, R-La., at the Conversations With Conservatives event sponsored by the Heritage Foundation in Washington.\n\n\u201cThey need some basic plumbing lessons,\u201d joked Gohmert, R-Texas, after noting that some courts had found no \u201cbiological evidence to support marriage being between a man and a woman.\u201d\n\nMore seriously, he said the Supreme Court\u2019s gay marriage ruling of last June made it clear it was not a matter for the federal government.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court said this was a matter for the states to decide,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get back to real law and order, and that includes by judges not becoming God \u2026 We\u2019ve got to get the law back in the hands of the states, where it was originally intended in a federal Republic.\u201d 2014\n\nBachmann, R-Minnesota, said the gay marriage issue\u2019s continued volleying around federal courts was symptomatic of the \u201clawless\u201d legacy the Obama administration will leave.\n\nWhen the president declared at the outset of his term that he considered the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, passed by a bipartisan Congress and signed by a Democratic predecessor constitutional and that he would not enforce it, he set the tone for the controversy roiling the courts.\n\n\u201cHe announced to the nation he wasn\u2019t going to faithfully executive the laws of the land. And what\u2019s interesting is that essentially you have judges citing an unconstitutional act of the president as precedent for their lawless decision of activism.\u201d\n\nAs an example, she said that same kind of rule by presidential fiat is what\u2019s playing out now with Obamacare, as regulations are waived and deadlines moved to suit the expedience of the moment.\n\nThe law, she said, \u201cis \u201cwhatever a president says at a press conference, or a tweet, or whatever some bureaucrat says. When you do that, you have a legal constitutional anarchy.\n\n\u201cMy opinion is, the legacy of Barack Obama will be the establishment of lawlessness in the United States. And that doesn\u2019t portend well for the future of the United States.\u201d\n\nCheck out the audio here. The gay marriage discussion starts about the 2:25 mark.\n\nH/T: Raw Story", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "Conservative congressman Louie Gohmert and Rep.
