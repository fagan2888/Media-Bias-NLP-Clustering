This is good news for British universities, as foreign students pay up to three times more in tuition than students from Britain and the EU.\n\nSouth Korea has also increased its share dramatically, from less then 0.2% in 2000 to 1.3% in 2012.\n\nRelated: America's brain drain dilemma\n\nMore than 4.5 million students enrolled outside their own country in 2012, with three-quarters of them studying in developed countries. Over half came from Asia, with China now representing 22% of all international students, followed by India and Korea.\n\nThe OECD praises countries that welcome international students, saying they boost local economies, since they speak the language and employers understand their qualifications.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "international students, college, university, migration, economy, CNNMoney, CNN, Ivana Kottasova, employment, economy, OECD", "title": "U.S. losing its appeal for foreign students", "og": {"url": "http://money.cnn.com/2014/12/01/pf/college/international-students-education/index.html", "site_name": "CNNMoney", "type": "article", "description": "A new global migration repor shows American universities are losing their supreme position in the global education system.", "title": "U.S. losing its appeal for foreign students"}, "section": "pf", "author": "Ivana Kottasova", "vr": {"category": "college", "type": "Article"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-12-01T04:05:49", "keywords": "international students, college, university, migration, economy, CNNMoney, CNN, Ivana Kottasova, employment, economy, OECD", "fb": {"app_id": 521848191196480}, "subsection": "college", "date": "2014-12-01 04:05:49", "twitter": {"url": "http://money.cnn.com/2014/12/01/pf/college/international-students-education/index.html", "description": "A new global migration repor shows American universities are losing their supreme position in the global education system.", "site": "@CNNMoney", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "U.S. losing its appeal for foreign students"}, "viewport": "width=1140", "description": "A new global migration repor shows American universities are losing their supreme position in the global education system."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce5fd\"", "article_summary": "This is good news for British universities, as foreign students pay up to three times more in tuition than students from Britain and the EU.\nOver half came from Asia, with China now representing 22% of all international students, followed by India and Korea.\nAlthough the U.S. still attracts the highest proportion of foreign students, other countries are becoming increasingly popular, biting into the U.S. market share.\nAll other English-speaking developed countries and Spain have increased their share of foreign students.\nA new global migration report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation shows American universities are losing their supreme position in the global education system."}
