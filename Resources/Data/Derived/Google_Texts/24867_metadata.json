Ascension Health is the parent company of Warren, Mich.-based St. John Providence Health System, a five-hospital system, and nine other hospitals in Michigan.Joseph Aoun, healthcare lawyer with Nuyen, Tomtishen and Aoun in Ann Arbor, said the acquisition of USHL will provide Together Health Network, a physician-led clinically integrated network, with the ability to participate in the state's health insurance exchange with its narrow provider network.USHL's target market is small employers with less than 100 employees. It has received approval from the CMS to sell various policies for small employers under the Affordable Care Act.Together Health is owned by two of the nation's largest healthcare systems, Ascension Health and Livonia-based Trinity Health . The two systems own 27 hospitals with more than 5,000 physicians on medical staffs in Michigan.\u201cThe acquisition makes a lot of sense,\u201d Aoun said. \u201cHospitals are now expected to manage population health and owning a health plan provides both infrastructure and a way to connect more directly with insurance purchasers.\u201dIn 2013, USHL reported $67.4 million in net premium, about half of which was from Michigan. Its surplus was approximately $8 million. USHL is also affiliated with Automated Benefits Services, a Michigan third-party administrator, according to documents filed with the insurance department on Jan. 14.The proposed acquisition of USHL will be through a newly formed subsidiary, Ascension Care Management, which states its \u201cprimary business is to own and operate businesses that are part of the population health management platform of Ascension.\u201d Anthony Tersigni , Ascension Health's CEO, is one of three directors of Ascension Care Management. The other two are top Ascension executives, CFO Anthony Speranzo and Joseph Impicciche, general counsel.After the acquisition, USHL will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of U.S. Health Holdings, a Michigan-based corporation.
