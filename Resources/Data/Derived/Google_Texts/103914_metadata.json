Is this what you want as the next governor? I would challenge you, please reach for lightning.\u201d\n\nBevin\u2019s promised lightning, though, is \u201clikely electrocution,\u201d Heiner retorted in his ending remarks.\n\n\u201cMatt, although he says he\u2019s not a politician, has taken a political approach,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 He knows very well that those are not our ads, and we want to be judged based on what I say and what comes from our campaign, and in fact it\u2019s illegal to respond to another group\u2019s ads. He wants to bait us into that.\u201d\n\nComer also took aim at CSG through Heiner. The group had distributed a direct-mail piece claiming Comer supported the politically divisive federal health law, which he vehemently denied.\n\n\u201cShame on you for your PAC sending out a direct-mail piece saying that I support Obamacare,\u201d Comer said, turning to Heiner.\n\nHeiner, the frontrunner in recent public polling, didn\u2019t respond to Comer, but he couldn\u2019t contain his silence when Bevin accused him and Comer of altering their stance on shuttering the state-based health exchange kynect.\n\nBevin challenged his opponents to \u201cbe consistent,\u201d but Heiner said Bevin\u2019s solution to simply yank the plug on those covered by Medicaid expansion is infeasible.\n\n\u201cThe facts are only 18 percent of the people that are in kynect right now are in the exchange,\u201d Heiner said. \u201cEight-two percent are in Medicaid, so essentially what you\u2019re hearing when you say, \u2018I\u2019ll just shut it down,\u2019 is \u2026 \u2018For 82 percent of Kentuckians in this plan, we\u2019ll just take their health care.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe fact that the federal disproportionate share is going away for indigent care ends up meaning that people that are in the middle of cancer treatment, people that are in the middle of all kinds of serious medical situations are kicked out of health care. That\u2019s not a responsible solution.\u201d\n\nHeiner instead suggested the state look elsewhere to conservative governors who\u2019ve incentivized good health, specifically pointing to Tennessee\u2019s Insure Tennessee plan to cover low-income residents.\n\n\u201cCan we get this straight? So now your for kynect again?\u201d Bevin asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying that kynect needs to end as it exists today because it\u2019s not financially sustainable,\u201d Heiner responded, adding he would change the health exchange in 2016.\n\nBevin also suggested Comer and Heiner supported tolling the Ohio River bridges under construction in downtown Louisville and Prospect.\n\nHis claim originated in Comer\u2019s vote for House Bill 3 in the 2009 special session, which established the Louisville and Southern Indiana Bridges Authority, and a 2009 Louisville Metro Council resolution, sponsored by Heiner and 14 others, requesting Gov. Steve Beshear and then-Mayor Jerry Abramson appoint members to the bi-state panel that eventually named a joint tolling board and set rates.\n\n\u201cI have been consistent from the very beginning that I\u2019m opposed to tolling that bridge,\u201d Bevin said when asked about tolling the Brent Spence Bridge in Covington. \u201cThere has never been any time in my life or in anything that I\u2019ve said that would ever contradict that.\u201d\n\nBut while Comer and Heiner said the Brent Spence Bridge needs to be built, tolls should not be considered as part of a funding plan.\n\nWhile Bevin noted many northern Kentucky representatives voted against HB 3, Comer noted Louisville\u2019s House delegates largely voted for the bill.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s stick to the facts,\u201d Comer said. \u201cIt had nothing to do with northern Kentucky.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does now,\u201d Bevin countered.\n\n\u201cNo, and don\u2019t be like Hal now,\u201d Comer said before mentioning CSG\u2019s direct-mail piece.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "cn|2", "description": "WITH VIDEO: Tempers flared before a televised audience as Kentucky\u2019s GOP gubernatorial candidates traded barbs over bridge tolls, the Affordable Care Act and attacks from an outside group backing Republican Hal Heiner on cn|2 Pure Politics\u2019 gubernatorial debate Tuesday.\n\n\tMore often than not,...", "title": "Candidates trade jabs on Pure Politics' gubernatorial debate with GOP primary less than a month away", "url": "http://mycn2.com/politics/candidates-trade-jabs-on-pure-politics-gubernatorial-debate-with-gop-primary-less-than-a-month-away", "image": "http://mycn2.com/images/10241.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://mycn2.com/images/10241.jpg", "title": "Candidates trade jabs on Pure Politics' gubernatorial debate with GOP primary less than a month away", "description": "<p><span class=\"caps\">WITH</span> <span class=\"caps\">VIDEO</span>: Tempers flared before a televised audience as Kentucky\u2019s <span class=\"caps\">GOP</span> gubernatorial candidates traded barbs over bridge tolls, the Affordable Care Act and attacks from an outside group backing Republican Hal Heiner on cn|2 Pure Politics\u2019 gubernatorial debate Tuesday.</p>\n\n\t<p>More often than not, Louisville investment manager Matt Bevin was in the midst of conflict, frequently needling Agriculture Commissioner James Comer and Louisville real estate developer Hal Heiner with four weeks until Republican voters pick their party\u2019s gubernatorial nominee.</p>\n\n\t<p>Bevin asked if viewers \u201cwant a governor who will hide behind the lies of people\u201d who want to \u201csoil the bed of the Republican primary.\u201d</p>\n\n\t<p>\u201cHal Heiner\u2019s former campaign manager is the guy who is now the spokesman for that <span class=\"caps\">PAC</span>, and yet supposedly no coordination at all,\u201d Bevin said in his closing statement of the 501(c )(4) group Citizens for a Sound Government, which is supporting Heiner. \u201cIs this what you want?
