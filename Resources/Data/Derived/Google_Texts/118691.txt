Florida is up to 50 cases of Zika virus, including six in Central Florida.

That’s with two new South Florida infections added Monday to the Florida Department of Health’s list. None of the cases originated in Florida, but instead came from people who traveled outside the continental U.S.

Health officials fear an outbreak in Florida because the mosquito that spreads the virus is found in the state. Zika in pregnant mothers has been linked to severe birth defects, and the virus has also been linked with a rare form of paralysis.
