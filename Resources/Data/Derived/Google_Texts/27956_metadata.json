New research shows that 36 percent of the uninsured say they do not know about the financial assistance available to them that can help get them health coverage.\n\nThis is significant because the same research shows that the financial help, also known as a subsidy or tax credit, is the most important factor that drives people to sign up for health care coverage.\n\nSince 2014, more than 2 million have signed up for health insurance coverage through Covered California. More than 350,000 people in Los Angeles County have been enrolled, and many more have enrolled in Medi-Cal.\n\nAlthough we have all worked together to dramatically raise awareness about the new law, we have more work to do.\n\nWe estimate there are still more than 2 million uninsured people in the state who either are eligible for Covered California or qualify for no-cost or low-cost Medi-Cal. Approximately 600,000 of them live in Los Angeles County.\n\nMany of the uninsured have adopted what we call a \u201cculture of coping.\u201d They are surviving, day to day. They skip care, they split medications, and they rely on emergency services when their situation becomes too tough. They believe that health insurance is beyond their reach.\n\nThrough Covered California, many consumers can get financial help, or a tax subsidy, that can be worth hundreds of dollars per month and make health care a reality.\n\nWe are spotlighting the fact that more than half of those who are currently enrolled in Covered California pay less than $100 a month, with the balance being covered by the federal tax credit. That is real affordability.\n\nYou can find out if you qualify for financial help, and examine your plan options, by using the \u201cShop and Compare Tool\u201d at CoveredCA.com.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsumers in Los Angeles County can have that protection by enrolling in Covered California and choosing among seven health insurance companies offering plans in their area: Anthem Blue Cross of California, Blue Shield of California, Health Net, Kaiser Permanente, L.A. Care Health Plan, Molina Healthcare and, new for 2016, Oscar Health Plan of California \u2014 which will offer plans in parts of the county.\n\nGoing forward, we will be spotlighting enrollment events at storefronts, offices of insurance agents, community events and other locations. Localized help information is available at CoveredCA.com.\n\nThis year\u2019s open-enrollment period runs until Jan. 31. However, if you qualify for Medi-Cal, you can enroll at any point during the year.\n\nIf you or someone you know doesn\u2019t have health care coverage, this is the opportunity to get coverage. Now is the time to talk to your friends and family about getting covered and getting some peace of mind.\n\nNo matter what happens in your life, whether you are following your dream as a small-business owner or whether you are in between jobs, \u2014 Covered California will be there for you.\n\nMake sure you know about the new plans and expanded coverage that will give you access to more doctors and more facilities than ever before. Shop around for the plan that best fits your budget and health care needs.\n\nMake sure you know about the significant improvements to our plans, including family dental plans, and more benefits being accessible without being subject to a deductible.\n\nMake sure you know that the penalty for going without insurance if you can afford it is going up in 2016 \u2014 and going up big time. If you don\u2019t get coverage, you could be subject to a penalty of up to almost $200 per month. But the bigger \u201cpenalty\u201d is what you would have to pay if you went to the emergency room without coverage and walked out with a $30,000 bill.\n\nSo, please, tell your family and friends. Spread the word. Help us make Los Angeles County, and California, a better, healthier place for all of us.\n\nPeter V.
