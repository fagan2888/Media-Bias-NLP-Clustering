Yet it turns out we\u2019re all getting much healthier \u2014 and we have democratic governance to thank.\n\nAngus Deaton\u2019s new book, The Great Escape, is a wonderful treatment of global inequality (I\u2019m in the process of writing a full review). The book\u2019s second and third chapters document two things conclusively: first, the developed world\u2019s life expectancy has almost doubled in the past 150 years, and second, poorer countries have made huge progress in catching up since World War II.\n\nWhat happened? One popular theory is economic growth. The Industrial Revolution made the First World richer, the theory goes, and then the rest started to quickly catch up after the emergence of the modern global economy.\n\nNot so fast, Deaton says. Economic growth played some role in improving health, but it wasn\u2019t the main cause. How do we know? \u201cWhen we try to match the onset of economic growth with the improvements in health, the timing is wrong,\u201d Deaton writes. \u201cThe improvements in child mortality across north-western Europe were much too uniform to be explained by economic growth, which began at different times in different countries.\u201d\n\nThe same is true of the developing world in our time. Check out this chart Deaton put together comparing economic growth to decline in infant mortality, where each country is represented by a dot proportional to its population size (important largely because Indian and Chinese citizens make up a huge percentage of the improving-health contingent):\n\nNotice any relationship between economic growth and fewer tragic deaths? Exactly. When you treat each country as a datapoint and look for overall trends, \u201cthere is no relationship [between growth and infant mortality] at all.\u201d Indeed, Haiti, whose economy contracted from 1960 to 2009, showed a faster decline in infant mortality during that period than the growth behemoths, China and India.\n\nWhat\u2019s actually happening? Deaton gives the bulk of the credit to scientists and those most unsexy of heroes, politicians and public health officials. Scientific advancements, like the germ theory of disease, taught us what we needed to save lives \u2014 and then government did it. \u201cThe improvement of public health required action by public authorities,\u201d Deaton writes, \u201cwhich required political agitation and consent and could not have been accomplished through the market alone.\u201d\n\nSome concrete examples. Fixing the fecal-born illnesses that turned Industrial Revolution cities required big investments in sewage treatment infrastructure and public health monitoring. \u201cTurning the germ theory into safe water and sanitation takes time and requires both money and state capacity,\u201d Deaton says, and \u201cthese were not always available a century ago, and in many parts of the world they are not available today.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not wrong. The biggest killers in the developing world today \u2014 tuberculosis, malaria, diarrhea, and lower respiratory infections \u2014 are solved by \u201cbetter pest control, better water, and better sanitation, all of which require collective action, organized by central or local governments.\u201d They are, in short, \u201cproblems of public health, not private health care.\u201d\n\nThe implications are far more wide-reaching than you might think. First, Deaton\u2019s work suggests that the most pressing moral problem of our time \u2014 the horrific fates the world\u2019s poorest suffer for the crime of being born in the wrong place \u2014 is actually two separate, albeit related, problems. Poverty and material deprivation make people\u2019s lives immeasurably worse, but the things that tend to end these lives prematurely won\u2019t be solved by turning the growth key. Better governance in and health assistance to poor countries are important things that are independent, to a significant degree, of economic development in those countries.\n\nMore deeply, the secret history of saving lives tells us that the health of citizens is always a government problem. Bill Gates and others like him do invaluable work, but nowhere in the world have the great victories over untimely death been won primarily by private forces. It\u2019s just never happened.\n\nThis means that, in any society with publicly provided health infrastructure \u2014 which is to say, all of the successful ones \u2014 the state is intimately involved in ensuring its citizens lead healthy lives. The Obamacare-inspired debate in the United States about whether health care is a \u201cright\u201d the government ought to provide its citizens is thus misplaced; virtually everyone in the world already assumes the government is responsible for providing for the good health of its citizens.\n\nIt\u2019s worth unpacking this point a bit. Health care, what Deaton calls the \u201cphysician-patient health care system,\u201d isn\u2019t the same thing as public health campaigns like vaccination or the distribution of malaria nets. But the basic philosophical argument for a state-enforced right to both is the same: the government has an obligation to do what\u2019s necessary to preserve the health of its citizens against disease. It\u2019s hard to see how, in principle, you could craft an argument for universal access to vaccination that wouldn\u2019t necessarily imply a right to see a physician.\n\nThe point is buttressed by the practical reality of health care systems. Deaton looks at the private health care system in Rajasthan, India, where most doctors were \u201cquacks of one kind or another,\u201d some of whom \u201chad not even graduated from high school.\u201d The reason, he finds, is that the Rajasthani government lacks the ability to do the thing that states need to do to make health care reliable; it \u201cis capable neither of delivering health care itself nor of providing the regulation, licensing, and policing that is required for an effective and safe private health care system.\u201d Except in places like Rajasthan, the government is always-already involved in running the private health care system. There is no brightline between public health and private health care, because government involvement in both depends on the same basic premise: we deserve to be protected against preventable illness.\n\nOf course, the fact that the government needs to play some role in the provision of health care isn\u2019t an argument for Obamacare over catastrophic insurance and HSAs, or for single payer or a British-style nationalized health industry. It is, however, a nail in the coffin of the vulgar libertarian argument that we don\u2019t have a right to health care. Anyone who thinks the massive reduction in death over the past 150 years is a good thing implicitly believes that we do. The real debate now is the right way to vindicate people\u2019s right not to die.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "One fascinating book explains why we're saving more lives than we used to -- and why the government deserves the lion's share of the credit.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "One fascinating book explains why we're saving more lives than we used to -- and why the government deserves the lion's share of the credit.", "title": "The Surprising Reason Why The World Is Getting Healthier", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/11/05/2886381/angus-deaton-government-health/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/vaccine.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One fascinating book explains why we're saving more lives than we used to -- and why the government deserves the lion's share of the credit.", "creator": "@zackbeauchamp", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/vaccine-321x214.jpg", "title": "The Surprising Reason Why The World Is Getting Healthier", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/vaccine.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/vaccine.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-05T12:14:35+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda578\"", "article_summary": "Health The Surprising Reason Why The World Is Getting Healthier CREDIT: UNAMIDCREDIT: UNAMIDReading news coverage tends to give one the impression that the world is perpetually on the brink of collapse.\nHealth care, what Deaton calls the \u201cphysician-patient health care system,\u201d isn\u2019t the same thing as public health campaigns like vaccination or the distribution of malaria nets.\nFixing the fecal-born illnesses that turned Industrial Revolution cities required big investments in sewage treatment infrastructure and public health monitoring.\nThere is no brightline between public health and private health care, because government involvement in both depends on the same basic premise: we deserve to be protected against preventable illness.\nIt is, however, a nail in the coffin of the vulgar libertarian argument that we don\u2019t have a right to health care."}
