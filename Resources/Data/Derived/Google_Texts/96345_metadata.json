Jesus was not welcome in Nazareth. You can\u2019t make this stuff up, folks \u2013 as documented in my upcoming new book, \u201cGod Less America.\u201d\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom filed a federal lawsuit against the Nazareth Area School District on behalf of Donald and Ellen Abramo and their son. They claim a teacher and the principal at Floyd R. Shafer Elementary School violated their son\u2019s constitutional rights.\n\nThey allege that the little boy was prohibited from distributing St. Valentine\u2019s Day cards to his classmates because the cards contained a sentence about the religious history of the holiday along with the Bible verse, John 3:16.\n\n\u201cTo single out a faith-based message for censorship is exactly the type of hostility to religion that the First Amendment forbids,\u201d ADF attorney Jeremy Tedesco said.\n\nThe school district did not return numerous calls seeking comment. A spokesman also declined to comment to the local newspaper.\n\nThe Alliance Defending Freedom lawsuit is jaw-dropping. The school was apparently so hostile to religion that the Abramo\u2019s son was scared to pray over his meals because \u201che is afraid of getting in trouble.\u201d\n\nIn early February, Abramo received a letter from her son\u2019s teacher with instructions about the distribution of \u201cFriendship Day\u201d cards (also known as Valentine\u2019s Day). It seems that Floyd R. Shafer is one of those \u201cpolitically correct\u201d public schools.\n\nThe note also instructed parents to avoid attaching candy the cards.\n\n\u201cPlease remember not to attach anything other than non-edible treats or approved snack items to the Valentines,\u201d the instructions read. See? It really is one of those \u201cpolitically correct\u201d public schools.\n\nSo instead of candy, the first-grader and his older siblings decided to include a message about the history of St. Valentine.\n\n\u201cSt. Valentine was imprisoned and martyred for presiding over marriages and for spreading the news of God\u2019s love,\u201d the message read. \u201cIn honor of St. Valentine\u2019s Day, I want you to know that God loves you!!!\u201d\n\nThe card also included a Bible verse, John 3:16.\n\nWhen the day came to distribute the cards, the boy\u2019s teacher \u201cbecame concerned about the religious message,\u201d the lawsuit states.\n\nThe teacher immediately delivered the cards to the principal \u2013 identified in the lawsuit as William Mudlock.\n\n\u201cPrincipal Mudlock reviewed the cards and determined that, because of their religious nature (the boy) would not be allowed to distribute them,\u201d the lawsuit states.\n\nThe principal then directed that the religious messages be removed from the cards and the cards were then placed in a bin. He believed the child was guilty of \u201cproselytizing\u201d his religious faith.\n\nBoys and girls were able to distribute cards that included images of a skull and toy guns \u2013 but the card that included a message about Jesus was deemed to be offensive.\n\nLater that afternoon Mrs. Abramo called the school searching for answers. The principal reiterated that the cards could not be distributed because of their religious nature. He said the cards might be \u201coffensive\u201d to someone, the lawsuit states.\n\nHe also claimed the school was prohibited from giving students any religious materials. Well, that\u2019s rich because the school wasn\u2019t passing out the cards \u2013 the little boy was.\n\nIn spite of her pleas, the school refused to back down \u2013 leading the little boy to break down in tears.\n\n\u201cHe was very sad,\u201d attorney Tedesco told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible message to send to kids. There were cards with guns and skeletons, yet his religious beliefs are taboo?\u201d\n\nThe Abramos, who are Catholic, were not quite ready to let the incident slide by. So they contacted the school superintendent (the same one who won\u2019t return my telephone calls). He didn\u2019t return their calls either.\n\nInstead, the school district\u2019s attorney replied \u2013 a guy by the name of Gary Brienza. All I can say is \u2014 brace yourself for what he said.\n\n\u201cMr. Brienza proceeded to tell the Abramos that under the U.S. Constitution there is both a \u2018freedom of religion\u2019 and a \u2018freedom from religion,\u2019\u201d the lawsuit states.\n\n\u201cHe claimed that the Constitution prohibits a person from imposing their religious beliefs on someone else; therefore, the school district can restrict a student from distributing religious materials,\u201d the lawsuit further states.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what law school Brienza attended, but it might be a good idea for somebody to subpoena his Constitutional Law class grades.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if we\u2019re dealing with a bunch of ignorant educators or a bunch of anti-Christian bigots. Neither bodes well for people of faith in the town of Nazareth.\n\nIt really takes a special kind of stupid to get worked up over a Valentine\u2019s Day card. Pardon me, I meant to say Friendship Day card.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It\u2019s almost Easter, but an incident that occurred just before Valentine\u2019s Day crossed by desk \u2014 and it\u2019s got me fired up..05/24/2016 1:21:52AM EST.", "author": "Todd Starnes", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "It\u2019s almost Easter, but an incident that occurred just before Valentine\u2019s Day crossed by desk \u2014 and it\u2019s got me fired up.", "title": "- Jesus Card Not Welcome In Nazareth School", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/toddstarnes/2014/04/10/jesus-card-not-welcome-in-nazareth-school-n1822755", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/93/6b75f109-2d85-4b40-a7e6-188e4267661b.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "It\u2019s almost Easter, but an incident that occurred just before Valentine\u2019s Day crossed by desk \u2014 and it\u2019s got me fired up.", "title": "- Jesus Card Not Welcome In Nazareth School", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/toddstarnes/2014/04/10/jesus-card-not-welcome-in-nazareth-school-n1822755", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/93/6b75f109-2d85-4b40-a7e6-188e4267661b.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Jesus Card Not Welcome In Nazareth School, Todd Starnes, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfb24\"", "article_summary": "It really takes a special kind of stupid to get worked up over a Valentine\u2019s Day card.\nIt\u2019s almost Easter, but an incident that occurred just before Valentine\u2019s Day crossed by desk \u2014 and it\u2019s got me fired up.\nteacher confiscated his Valentine\u2019s Day cards because they contained religious messages and a Bible verse about Jesus, a lawsuit filed this week in federal court alleges.\n\u201cIn honor of St. Valentine\u2019s Day, I want you to know that God loves you!!\nWhen the day came to distribute the cards, the boy\u2019s teacher \u201cbecame concerned about the religious message,\u201d the lawsuit states."}
