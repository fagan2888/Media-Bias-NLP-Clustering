You are such a hypocrite!\u201d\n\nSo what do you do? Do you evade, cling to the code of parental silence, change the subject? Or do you crumble, admit everything, overshare, lose your dignity as well as any leg up you might have on these frustrating offspring who seem to see right through you?\n\nMore from DAME: \u201cIs \u2018Superman\u2019 the Greatest Adoption Story of All Time?\u201d\n\nMost of us have done both.\n\nWhen I was a teenager, experimenting with just about everything in my path, I was fortunate enough to have a father who leveled with me. He warned me about the drugs he\u2019d seen do the most damage (alcohol and cocaine), and told me that pot was not a big deal but advised me never to drive stoned. He let me know that I could come to him without fear of punishment or censure.\n\nI shared his stories, and mine, with my daughter. Not because I wanted to give up my parental authority, but because to me, being authentic and even vulnerable with my kids has always made them trust me more.\n\nAs with so many things, we can learn a lot from comedian Louis CK. In a recent NPR interview with Terry Gross, Louis described his teen pothead years, during which he was \u201cbarely cognizant of any kind of life; I never went to classes.\u201d Now that his daughters are tweens, he told Gross, it\u2019s a topic he thinks about a lot. There\u2019s no way he would hide the truth of his youthful indiscretions, he said.\n\n\u201cMy kids know that I did drugs. I think it\u2019s important to share your mistakes with your kids\u2014because you get knowledge from your mistakes and wisdom from it. If you can\u2019t pass that on, what good are you?\u201d\n\nStill, it\u2019s not easy to know how much to reveal, especially when kids are very little.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been careful about sharing certain things,\u201d says Marie of her 6-year-old son. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know that I ever smoked. He doesn\u2019t know that I was treated for alcoholism, or that I did drugs.\u201d\n\nBut smoking is one of those things young kids learn about. \u201cHe noticed people smoking on the street,\u201d says Marie, \u201cand he would see the no smoking sigh and he would say \u2018no smoking!\u2019\u201d Still, if or when it comes up that Marie smoked for years before he was born, she says, \u201cI would tell him the truth, but I definitely would have a lot of feelings about it. It would be the first big thing where I\u2019m telling him to do one thing and I\u2019ve done another entirely.\u201d\n\nMore from DAME: \u201cWhen Will Women Rule the World?\u201d\n\nFor Jeanne Eschenberg Sager, the mother of a 10-year-old daughter, the issue that gives her pause is her own very young marriage. \u201cI got married at 18,\u201d she says, \u201cand while I wouldn\u2019t say I regret it, I struggle any time my daughter comes near the \u2018how you and Daddy met\u2019 story.\u201d Sager, parenting editor at SheKnows.com, expects that one day her daughter may accuse her of hypocrisy. \u201cI absolutely, 100 percent, without a doubt do not want my daughter getting married at 18! But it\u2019s hard to tell a kid, \u2018no, don\u2019t do it, it doesn\u2019t work,\u2019 when you\u2019re living, breathing proof that every once in awhile \u2026 it does.\u201d\n\nThere are the things we did in our youth\u2014smoking, drinking, shoplifting, or sleeping around\u2014that we fear telling our kids about. But then there\u2019s another category entirely: the hidden traumas and past pains, the horrible things that may have made us who we are, but that we wish our kids would never have to know about.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When I was a teenager, I was fortunate to have a father who leveled with me.
