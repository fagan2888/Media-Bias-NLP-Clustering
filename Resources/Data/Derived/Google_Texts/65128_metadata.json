The Highway Patrol was also very concerned that having it in the middle of the day could lead to having demonstrations of some kind.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin previously stated that the monument would remain on state capitol grounds. Fallin\u2019s desires did not come to fruition, as the court recently rejected a reconsideration request from the state and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt regarding the ruling.\n\nThe upheaved monument will now be housed on private property by the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs, a private conservative think-tank.\n\nThe Ten Commandments monument has ignited controversy since former Oklahoma Gov. Brad Henry signed a bill in 2009 allowing it on the state capitol grounds.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, \u201cState Rep. Mike Ritze, R-Broken Arrow, introduced the bill and said he would use family funds to pay for the $10,000 cost of the monument.\u201d\n\nThe establishment of the monument spurred requests from other religious organizations to have their own monuments erected. These organizations range from a satanic church to the satirical Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.\n\nNewsOK published a piece by Ritze on July 8 regarding the outcome of the Supreme Court opinion.\n\nRitze described this decision as \u201cwoefully inadequate and embarrassing for the state\u2019s legal profession.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe court devoted merely seven paragraphs to explain its decision[.] \u2026 Never has the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled against a passive display with religious content. In Meyer v. Oklahoma City, for example, the court found a 50-foot lighted cross sitting on public property to be lawful under the same part of the Oklahoma Constitution it used to strike down the Ten Commandments monument.\u201d\n\nThe removal has satisfied the ACLU of Oklahoma, which has consistently advocated for its removal and filed the lawsuit on behalf of four plaintiffs.\n\nThe legal director of Oklahoma ACLU, Brady Henderson, told The Oklahoman, \u201cObviously we\u2019re pleased with the decision. The whole case is controversial, but something that is undeniable is that the court is getting this right. The court is following the law.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The monument of the Ten Commandments that previously stood on the Oklahoma State Capitol grounds was removed late Monday night.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The monument of the Ten Commandments that previously stood on the Oklahoma State Capitol grounds was removed late Monday night.", "title": "Removal of 10 Commandments Monument in Oklahoma Reignites Controversy", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151006_TenCommandments_Jones.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-07T22:45:14+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1OZ4Fgx"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The monument of the Ten Commandments that previously stood on the Oklahoma State Capitol grounds was removed late Monday night.", "title": "Removal of 10 Commandments Monument in Oklahoma Reignites Controversy", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151006_TenCommandments_Jones.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "founding principles", "published_time": "2015-10-07T19:45:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-07T22:45:14+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Oklahoma, Supreme Court, Ten Commandments, Monument"}, "article_summary": "The monument of the Ten Commandments that previously stood on the Oklahoma state capitol grounds was removed late Monday night.\nThe Ten Commandments monument has ignited controversy since former Oklahoma Gov.\n\u2026 Never has the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled against a passive display with religious content.\nAccording to the Associated Press, the state paid a contractor $4,700 to remove the monument following the 7-2 decision by the Oklahoma Supreme Court on June 30 that found the monument in violation of the Oklahoma Constitution.\nNewsOK published a piece by Ritze on July 8 regarding the outcome of the Supreme Court opinion."}
