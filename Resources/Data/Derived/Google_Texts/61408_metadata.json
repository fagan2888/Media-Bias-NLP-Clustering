You bet it\u2019s a shame. It\u2019s a shame that as often as conservatives pose valuable questions about America\u2019s past, the state of the nation, and, yes, what makes America exceptional, they continually afford us valueless, if not insidious, answers\u2014answers that suppress the story of the making of American democracy, ignore the accelerating concentration of power and wealth, and deny America\u2019s historic purpose and promise. And sadly, in his new book, the renowned black conservative intellectual Shelby Steele does just that.\n\nA Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, a recipient of the National Humanities Medal, and the author of several books, including the award-winning 1990 title, The Content of Our Character: A New Vision of Race in America, in which Steele rightly asked, What happened to the promise of the 1960s\u2014 the promise of the civil rights movement, the victories for freedom, equality, and democracy registered in the 1964 Civil Rights and 1965 Voting Rights acts, and the initiatives of the Great Society and War on Poverty? He even led me to believe that he had critical and compelling things to say\u2014things that might help us talk together about the pressing crises of the day from Ferguson to New York and D.C.\n\nIn the very first chapter of Shame, Steele offers a seemingly heartfelt lament that American public life since the \u201960s has turned into a politics of tribalism in which left and right have their own cultural bases, communications media, and award systems, in which liberals have the universities, NPR, The New York Times, and MacArthur grants, and conservatives have think thanks, talk radio, The Wall Street Journal, and the Bradley Prizes (and he might well have added that liberals have the presidency and conservatives, the Congress). As he writes: \u201csince the 1960s, \u2018liberal\u2019 and \u2018conservative\u2019 have come to function almost like national identities in their own right. To be one or the other is not merely to lean left or right\u2014toward \u2018labor\u2019 or \u2018business\u2019\u2014within a common national identity; it is to belong to a different vision of America altogether, a vision that seeks to supersede the opposing vision and to establish itself as the nation\u2019s common identity.\u201d\n\nIndeed, I began to imagine that Steele was going to offer a serious historical argument about how we got here, how we might start to transcend what he himself calls \u201cThe Great Divide,\u201d and how we might act to renew America\u2019s promise. At the least, I expected he would attend honestly and critically to the developments of the past 50 years\u2014a half-century in which, following world-historic democratic advances at home and abroad, we Americans have suffered not just the return of gross \u201cGilded Age\u201d class inequalities and racially-based urban riots, but also concerted efforts to constrain workers from organizing, low-income minority citizens from exercising their voting rights, and women from controlling their own bodies. But I was wrong.\n\nSteele is an undeniably good writer. His earlier works, whatever we might think of his intellectual politics, provocatively challenged the prevailing political correctness and sharpened the thinking of all of us. And at places in this new book he does not fail to say interesting, at times moving, and even, at other times, entertaining things. I particularly \u201cenjoyed\u201d the story he uses to open the book\u2014the story of his participation in a weeklong conference on race and politics at the Aspen Institute, the liberal elite\u2019s intellectual playground in Colorado.\n\nAsked, along with his fellow panelists, to prepare a response to the question \u201cWhat do you want most for America,\u201d Steele apparently upset the assembled folk by saying that he wanted \u201can end to white guilt.\u201d It\u2019s not that he was absolving present-day whites of racism. Rather, as he goes on to relate, \u201cI then used my allotted few minutes to define white guilt as the terror of being seen as racist\u2014a terror that has caused whites to act guiltily toward minorities even when they feel no actual guilt. My point was that this terror\u2026 has spawned a new white paternalism toward minorities since the 1960s that, among other things, has damaged the black family more profoundly than segregation ever did.\u201d In fact, he insisted, this \u201cbenevolent paternalism of white guilt had injured the self-esteem, if not the souls, of minorities in ways that the malevolent paternalism of white racism never had.\u201d Finally, he relates how his words incited a young white man to stand forth and implore everyone not to believe what they had just heard: \u201cHe wanted to reassure them that blacks were still suffering \u2026 that racism, discrimination, and inequality were still alive\u2014still great barriers to black advancement.\u201d As Steele remembers it, his own remarks had \u201cthreatened [the Aspen crowd] with a kind of moral disgrace.\u201d\n\nAs much as Steele\u2019s provocation of the rich tickled me\u2014though I think they were probably looking to be provoked, for why else would they have invited him, a famous black conservative, to their retreat?\u2014he would soon disappoint me. Instead of trying to break new ground as some conservative intellectuals have recently sought, or at least purported, to do, Steele ends up offering a new, no less nasty, rendition of a story we have heard incessantly for more than 50 years from right-wing figures ranging from Ronald Reagan to Rush Limbaugh: that liberalism is responsible for nearly everything that has gone wrong in America since the \u201960s. Note that I say \u201cliberalism\u201d and not \u201cliberals,\u201d because Steele himself essentially reifies the politics and ideas of liberalism into a faceless god-like force. Rarely does he cite any politicians or writers or their words. And when he does refer to a liberal or progressive figure, he misrepresents them\u2014as he does with the ideas and labors of Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nMaking nothing of 200 years of democratic struggles from the bottom up, Steele reduces the goals of the \u201ccivil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s\u201d to \u201cclassical Jeffersonian liberalism\u2014that liberalism which sought freedom for the individual above all else.\u201d Without question that great and forceful founding ideal was fundamental to the cause. But the postwar movement and campaigns for racial justice entailed more than the pursuit of 18th-century liberalism. Steele not only makes no mention of the struggles, advances, and legacies of the New Deal \u201930s and World War II fight for the Four Freedoms pursued by Americans in all their diversity. Even worse, he utterly ignores the fact that King was a democratic socialist who campaigned both for black and minority civil and political rights, and for economic justice and the rights of working people and the poor of every color. Never forget that the 1963 March on Washington organized by socialist black labor leader A. Phillip Randolph, with the active support of UAW leader Walter Reuther, at which King delivered his famous \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech, was a \u201cMarch for Jobs and Freedom.\u201d\n\nOf course, I should have seen it coming. But I had hoped, rather naively, that Steele intended his Aspen Institute tale to introduce something other than one more over-the-top assault on liberalism. After all, he proceeds directly from that story to his lamentation over America\u2019s prevailing political tribalism\u2014a lamentation that seemed to position him to chastise left and right alike: \u201cWhen we let nationalism shape the form of our liberal or conservative identities\u2014when we practice our ideological leaning as if it were a divine right, an atavism to be defended at all cost\u2014then we put ourselves on a warlike footing.\u201d Reading that allowed me to hope that he was going to treat how the powers that be, both liberal and conservative, were culpable for jeopardizing America\u2019s historic purpose and promise.\n\nBut forget it \u2026 Taking to the very warpath he seemed to want us to avoid, Steele accuses \u201cliberalism\u201d of creating a political and economic order that not only has failed to fulfill the promise of the \u201960s, but, even worse, has subjected minorities to a new, apparently-benevolent but fundamentally evil \u201cwhite paternalism.\u201d Determined to sustain its political and cultural hold on America, liberalism, he charges\u2014without presenting us with any solid historical evidence\u2014has fostered, in the wake of the transformative \u201960s and the shattering of America\u2019s traditional narrative, an ideology of anti-Americanism that portrays the United States as \u201ccharacterologically evil\u201d (racist, sexist, imperialist), denies American greatness, goodness, and exceptionalism, and inculcates in minority Americans a world view that obscures the changes and opportunities afforded by the victories of the \u201960s and burdens and disempowers them by imbuing them with grievances instead of challenges. That damn liberalism: \u201cSuperficially it is very \u2018caring\u2019 towards blacks, minorities, and the poor,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt befriends them, promises them all manner of programs and policies. It makes a show of being deferential toward their woundedness, of bowing before their past victimization as before an irrefutable moral authority. But, of course, all this deference is seduction. The new liberalism does not pursue the actual uplift of minorities and the poor. It pursues dispensation from America\u2019s past sins for whites\u2014the imprimatur of innocence.\u201d\n\nAnd guess what? Having indicted liberalism for waging a \u201cculture war\u201d that has not only served to divide Americans into political tribes, but also to wed \u201cthe formerly oppressed\u201d to a sense of themselves as still very much oppressed, Steele directs our attention to a new \u201cpolitics of idealism,\u201d \u201cthe new counterculture,\u201d which, you got it, is contemporary conservatism: \u201ca faith in free market capitalism, smaller government, higher educational standards, the reinforcement of family.\u201d\n\nCome on: Free market capitalism? Assuming there is such a thing as a free market, haven\u2019t we suffered enough of it these past several years? Smaller government? Who among us wants to give up the hard-won democratic programs of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Obamacare, Environmental Protection, Workplace Safety, Consumer Protection, etc., etc., etc. \u2026 And in the face of overwhelming and engrossing corporate power, who really wants to reduce the countervailing power of democratic government?\n\nEnough with the political questions. Let\u2019s consider the history that Steele ignores. For a start, he ignores the fact that American greatness depended not simply on a commitment to Jeffersonian liberalism but also on public action and largesse from the days of the 19th-century Homestead Act to those of the New Deal, with its the CCC, WPA, PWA, REA, and NYA, to the Second World War GI Bill, all of which not only built or rebuilt the nation, but also built or rebuilt generations of working Americans. Hell, the real tragedy of liberalism\u2019s War on Poverty was that it wasn\u2019t big enough and did not do enough. Just think of how successful LBJ\u2019s initiatives might have been had they included a serious effort to create public works and employment for black young people\u2014not to mention, if he had refused to pursue the war in Vietnam, which drained resources from the War on Poverty.\n\nFurthermore, while Steele insists that liberalism has won the culture war and that we are all the worse for it, our minority fellow citizens especially, he makes absolutely no mention of the right and corporate rich\u2019s continuing 40-year-long top-down war on popular democracy\u2014a class war from above that has succeeded in destroying American industries, undermining the nation\u2019s infrastructure, devastating middle-class communities and widening class inequality, and sending millions of Americans into the ranks of the working poor.\n\nBut let\u2019s not leave it at that, for while Steele does not do what I hoped he would, he has essentially challenged liberals and leftists to think anew about American exceptionalism. And whether or not we have all denied, disdained, or disparaged the idea as Steele claims, we have clearly allowed conservatives to lay hold of it, tell a story about it, and dictate its meaning. And doing so, they have used it not only to lambaste the left, but also limit American memory and imagination. In short, those of us who want to create a more democratic America must recover and reassert the original radical, indeed revolutionary, meaning of American exceptionalism.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

By their words and actions, they articulated America\u2019s historic purpose and promise. For all of their terrible faults and failings, they envisioned, demanded, and made real the ideals of freedom, equality, and democracy. And when ensuing generations of Americans confronted crises that placed the nation and its historic purpose and promise in jeopardy, they felt that democratic imperative and impulse and found it in themselves\u2014led by Lincoln and FDR, respectively\u2014to confront and prevail over their enemies not by suspending or abandoning the nation\u2019s finest ideals, but by advancing them.\n\nSteele and his fellow conservatives do not want us to remember that history, that purpose and promise, that exceptionalism. And so far, contrary to Steele\u2019s contentions, they\u2014with the deference, if not collusion, of all too many moderates and liberals\u2014are actually winning not just the class war, but also, in a most critical way, the culture war, as well.\n\nSteele had an opportunity to make a critical difference. But if he truly wants to do that he needs to rethink American history as much as do many of my fellow leftists.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "HarveyJKaye"}, "keywords": "u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201503021015, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/books", "description": "A new book from conservative intellectual Shelby Steele claims to offer new answers to the old problems of polarization, but offers the same critique\u2014blame liberals.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "The Shame of Conservative Intellectuals", "tags": "topic:politics", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"The Shame of Conservative Intellectuals\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/03/02/the-shame-of-conservative-intellectuals.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/03/02/the-shame-of-conservative-intellectuals/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47509710.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/03/02/the-shame-of-conservative-intellectuals\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-03-02T10:15:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Books\",\"author\":\"Harvey J.
