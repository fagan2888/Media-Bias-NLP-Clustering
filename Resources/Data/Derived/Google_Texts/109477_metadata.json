The Rams posted a 28-21 win, their third in a row. ( Andres Leighton / The Associated Press )\n\nALBUQUERQUE, N.M. \u2014 Colorado State knew it would give up yards to New Mexico's offense. The Rams did.\n\nThey knew there'd be some big plays in there, too. There were.\n\nBut Colorado State took care of the ball, creating three turnovers without a single giveaway, putting an end to New Mexico's dreams of a Mountain Division title with a 28-21 victory at University Stadium.\n\nIt made the Rams (6-5, 4-3 Mountain West) bowl eligible for the third straight year, and also crowned Air Force the division champ to advance to the Mountain West Championship game on Dec. 5, where the Falcons will face San Diego State.\n\n\"I'm really proud of the guys and the effort to keep playing,\" CSU coach Mike Bobo said. \"A lot of times we want it to be pretty. It's not a pretty game. It never plays out the way you think it's going to play out in a game, and you've got to keep playing for 60 minutes. Those guys did that.\"\n\nColorado State was most definitely wary of New Mexico's big-play capability, especially when paired with the Rams' penchant for giving up explosive plays. The Lobos (6-5, 4-3) had five plays account for 138 yards of total offense in the game, but the Rams didn't allow them to become fatal. In fact, the CSU defense came up with big plays time and again down the stretch to secure a third straight win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The one big drive where we got the blocked field goal, I feel that's the drive that exemplifies that, where we bowed our neck,\" linebacker Deonte Clyburn said. \"I feel every time they got a big play, we never really got down on ourselves, because we knew it was going to happy. They're a very good football team. They run the ball very well.\"\n\nThe Lobos did, to the tune of 268 yards in the game. Colorado State ran it pretty well, too, and they rushed their way to the victory in the fourth quarter.\n\nColorado State's Joe Hansley hauls in a 2-point conversion against the defense of New Mexico's Lee Crosby on Saturday. (Andres Leighton / The Associated Press)\n\nCSU trailed 21-20 when the Lobos put together another impressive drive, setting up first-and-goal from the 10 early in the fourth quarter. The Rams forced a field goal attempt, a 23-yarder that was blocked by DeAndre Elliott and recovered by CSU at their own 8.\n\nNot the most ideal of situations, but the offense capitalized on it, going 92 yards in 11 plays, with much of the territory covered by the run game. True freshman Izzy Matthews had seven carries in the march, good for 49 of his 89 yards on the night, the last one good for the go-ahead touchdown.\n\n\"I thought we should have done that all night,\" center Jake Bennett said. \"We definitely stalled out a few times in the red zone, but that drive was awesome. The team definitely felt the momentum going.\"\n\nCSU went for the 2-point try, with Nick Stevens hitting Joe Hansley for the conversion and a touchdown lead that was never dented, thanks to the defense.\n\nA play later, New Mexico quarterback Lamar Jordan was intercepted by linebacker Kevin Davis, a turnover the Rams failed to seize upon, losing yards on three straight plays, then Braxton Davis missed a 53-yard field goal attempt, his first try of the season.\n\nNew Mexico tried to do something with the break, driving across midfield when Jordan, who rushed for 97 yards, scrambled for an 11-yard gain on fourth-and-5. A play later, the gain was negated when Joe Kawulok sacked him for a 15-yard loss, then Jordan threw his third pick of the game, the final one hauled in by Kevin Pierre-Louis.\n\n\"I'm just very proud with how the defense responded and to finish the game,\" Bobo said.\n\nColorado State was able to strike first, intercepting Jordan on the second play of the game, then turning the turnover into a touchdown one play later on Deionte Gaines' 30-yard end around. The next three drives were all touchdowns, with CSU scoring on an 8-yard touchdown pass from Nick Stevens to Kivon Cartwright, points sandwiched in the middle of two long New Mexico scoring drives, each covering at least 10 plays.\n\nAfter having one field goal blocked in the first half, CSU went into the locker room with a 17-14 lead on Wyatt Bryan's 24-yard field goal as time expired.\n\nHe added a 22-yarder coming out of the break, then New Mexico took its first lead on a 36-yard run by Jhurell Pressley with 8:54 remaining in the third.\n\n\"I think it's huge for our defense, that sometimes throughout the season we struggled with,\" Davis said. \"For us to get the blocked field goal, the picks and then some sacks, it was huge for us, a big confidence booster.\"\n\nDalyn Dawkins rushed for 94 yards in the game, and Stevens completed 16 of his 23 throws for 264 yards, and more importantly, no interceptions.\n\nFor the third straight season, the Rams are bowl eligible, a far away thought a month ago after a 41-17 loss to San Diego State left them 3-5 and snake-bitten.\n\n\"This is everything,\" senior Trent Matthews said. \"It's what all the hard work in the offseason, spring, fall camp, that's what we wanted to do is be bowl eligible. It's just an honor.\"\n\nMike Brohard: 970-635-3633, mbrohard@reporter-herald.com and twitter.com/mbrohard\n\nCOLORADO ST. 28, NEW MEXICO 21\n\nNew Mexico 7 7 7 0 \u2014 21 First quarter CSU \u2014 Gaines 30 run (Bryan kick), 14:06.
