Donald Trump told Alabamians his favorite tome is the Good Book and he knows how Billy Graham felt.

With a turnout of 30,000, Trump told attendees, "Now I know how the great Billy Graham felt."

For comparison, Graham's last rally boasted a whopping 242,000 people.

But the politician didn't stop with the similarities at the numbers: "What's my favorite book? The Bible! The Bible. ... We take the Bible all the way," Trump said, according to a Washington Post reporter tweet.

The Republican front-runner is winning votes through his blunt talk, and he's confident of a win.

Trump is capitalizing on American dissatisfaction with the current government, building a campaign around heightened immigration standards and repealing President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act.

The Republican's tactics are far from subtle.

"This will not be an election based on a nice person. This will be an election based on a competent person," Trump reportedly said.
