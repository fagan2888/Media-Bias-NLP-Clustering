Americans gained access to new health plans subsidized by federal dollars. Insurers no longer can turn away people with existing conditions. Millions are now eligible for new Medicaid benefits.\n\nBut the federal law also upended existing health-insurance arrangements for millions of people. Companies worry about the expense of providing new policies, some hospitals aren\u2019t seeing the influx of new patients they expected to balance new costs and entrepreneurs say they may hire more part-time workers to avoid offering more coverage.\n\nThroughout 2014, The Wall Street Journal will follow stories of people affected by the health law, from industry executives to consumers to care providers. See photos of those individuals below. (Read the related article and see the interactive).\n\nBenjamin Lowy for The Wall Street Journal Alfred Chavis | The Striver.
