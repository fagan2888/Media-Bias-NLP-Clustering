Under the new spending bill, this tax would see a two-year delay. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch said the Cadillac tax is really a \u201cmiddle class tax hike disguised as a tax hit on the rich.\u201d\n\nIn an estimate released Wednesday by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan scorekeeper said the change would cost around $20 billion.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan applauded a provision in the spending bill for preventing a taxpayer bailout for Obamacare\u2019s risk corridors program, a policy rider touted by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.\n\n\u201cIf the only way Obamacare can continue is for taxpayers to bail out health insurers that lose money because of it, that\u2019s as good an indication as any that the whole law should be repealed and replaced,\u201d the presidential hopeful wrote in a letter to top members of the Senate in late-November. \u201cIt is our responsibility to completely shield the U.S. taxpayer from a deal in the Omnibus that might reimburse health insurers retroactively for these losses or any other future losses.\u201d\n\nThe tax-extender package, which was passed in the House Thursday, would also deliver a revenue blow to the ACA by delaying the 2.3 percent medical device excise tax implemented in 2013 under Obamacare for two years.\n\n\u201cFor years now, we\u2019ve seen support grow on both sides of the aisle for repealing this horrendously misguided tax,\u201d Hatch said during a floor speech Thursday. \u201cIt has been a top priority of mine since the day Obamacare was signed into law.:\n\nFollow Juliegrace Brufke on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
