Previous studies, in contrast, have found these types of errors to be incredibly rare.\n\n\"There is a substantial potential for medication-related harm and a number of opportunities to improve safety,\" study authors wrote in the journal Anesthesiology.\n\nAlthough hospital safety came to the forefront in 1999 with the Institute of Medicine's landmark report, \"To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System,\" it's an effort that continues throughout the healthcare industry. Current safety-improvement efforts largely surround processes and technology, such as bar code syringe-labeling systems to prevent drug-administration errors, Karen Nanji, M.D., an anesthesiologist at MGH and a lead author of the study, told Bloomberg Business.\n\nIndeed, the most frequently observed errors in the MGH study, according to an announcement, included the following:\n\nMistakes in labeling\n\nIncorrect dosage\n\nFailure to treat a problem indicated by a patient's vital signs\n\nDocumentation errors\n\n\"This study is especially valuable because it looked in a detailed way into medication errors in the operating room, where many of the safety strategies used in other settings have not yet been adopted, and used trained observers to document these errors,\" added study senior author David Bates, M.D., of the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital. \"The operating room has been a hard environment to evaluate, but we used observers familiar with anesthetic care to do the observation.\"\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- see the abstract\n\n- here's the article from Bloomberg Business\n\n- read the MGH study announcement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nSurgical never events: How to stop these preventable medical errors once and for all\n\nCould recording surgeries reduce medical errors?\n\nStudy: Medical errors affect surgeons personally, professionally\n\nTechnology mishaps account for one-fourth of OR errors\n\nAnesthesiologist must pay $500K for insulting man under sedation\n\n3 ways hospitals can reduce medical errors", "article_metadata": {"description": "Medication errors or unintended drug side effects occurred in about half of all surgeries done at Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital within an eight-month period, according to a\u00a0study\u00a0conducted at the world-renowned healthcare organization.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Medication errors or unintended drug side effects occurred in about half of all surgeries done at Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital within an eight-month period, according to a\u00a0study\u00a0conducted at the world-renowned healthcare organization.", "title": "Medication errors occur in half of surgeries, MGH study finds", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/medication-errors-occur-half-surgeries-mgh-study-finds/2015-10-26", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "adverse drug events,anesthesiology,Bar Coding,Health Information Technology,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Massachusetts General Hospital,Medication Error,Mgh,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient safety", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Health Information Technology,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce47b\"", "article_summary": "Study: Medical errors affect surgeons personally, professionallyTechnology mishaps account for one-fourth of OR errorsAnesthesiologist must pay $500K for insulting man under sedation3 ways hospitals can reduce medical errors\nTo learn more:- see the abstract- here's the article from Bloomberg Business- read the MGH study announcementRelated Articles:Surgical never events: How to stop these preventable medical errors once and for allCould recording surgeries reduce medical errors?\n\"There is a substantial potential for medication-related harm and a number of opportunities to improve safety,\" study authors wrote in the journal Anesthesiology.\nBy Aine CrytsMedication errors or unintended drug side effects occurred in about half of all surgeries done at Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) within an eight-month period, according to a study conducted at the world-renowned healthcare organization.\nWhile the research was conducted on procedures that took place at MGH, it indicates that similar failures happen at hospitals around the country."}
