Somehow, the Fox News questioners never quite got around to asking the candidates what they planned to do to help actual existing Americans cope with a profoundly rigged economy and a climate growing annoyingly inhospitable to living things. Then again, the candidates were asked what God would want them to do on their first day in office, other than repeal Obamacare and invade Iran, and they could have used the occasion to talk about minimum wages and heat waves, but it must have slipped their minds, too.\n\nCome to think of it, the Fox Three never even asked the candidates for their plans to replace Obamacare. That was most obliging of them, since no Republican has yet come up with a remotely plausible answer.\n\nThe news of the debate, the climax, came, of course at the very start (violating every premise of drama going clear back to Aristotle), with Donald Trump\u2019s declaration that he wouldn\u2019t commit to supporting the eventual Republican nominee unless it was he. Trump came into the debate as the tribune of the Fuck-You Republicans, who share his belief, as he stated at one point in the evening, that, \u201cWe don\u2019t have time for tone,\u201d by which he meant any regard for anyone who might conceivably question his ego. But with his raised-hand answer to the first question, he also became, more problematically for his prospects, the tribune of the Fuck You, Republicans (this one has a comma). This must have been deeply frustrating to Ted Cruz, whose apparent strategy is that if he runs hard enough against Mitch McConnell, he just might win.\n\nTwo of the candidates who just might win the nomination\u2014Jeb Bush or, if the Republicans are truly lucky, Marco Rubio\u2014did allude in passing to American workers who wanted full-time jobs but couldn\u2019t find them, and the broken ladder of upward mobility. Of the Midwestern governors, John Kasich came off far better than Scott Walker, who tended to fade into the woodwork. Kasich had enough moments of apparent decency to look like a formidable candidate if he can find a way from the middle to the front of a crowded pack. If he does get near the front, however, that decency\u2014in particular, his decision to accept Obamacare\u2019s extension of Medicaid\u2014will become the target of his GOP rivals, and likely bring him down. In a year when Fuck-You Republicans may yet constitute a plurality of primary voters, decency is no asset.\n\nThe high point of Trump\u2019s Fuck-You-ism was his out-of-leftfield threat to Megyn Kelly for querying him about his over-the-top sexist eruptions. Trump dismissed the concerns Kelly alluded to as so much \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201d To oppose Fuck-You Republicanism is to be a wuss submitting to political correctness, something no self-respecting Fox News viewer (Megyn Kelly notwithstanding) could ever do.\n\nChris Christie is a characterological Fuck-You Republican; Cruz, as we\u2019ve noted, is a strategic one; Scott Walker, somewhat oxymoronically, is a quiet one but, in matters of governance, a Fuck-You Republican nonetheless. Hell, the entire Republican right now consists entirely of Fuck-You Republicans; that\u2019s why John Boehner can\u2019t get anything through the House. A Fuck-You Republican cannot win the presidency and probably can\u2019t win the party\u2019s nomination, either, but the FYRs will surely make life difficult for the Bushes, Rubios, and Kasichs in the months ahead.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The American Prospect", "description": "At the first GOP primary debate in Cleveland last night, F-You Republicanism was out in full force.", "title": "No Time for Tone", "url": "http://prospect.org/article/no-time-tone", "image": "http://prospect.org/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/ap326280289267_0.jpg?itok=DNQIpsGg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "4dItj6FrXn-I63uD7pcvQKf3n3Qc6AIxiwwzo0_G4zk", "fb": {"admins": 431364, "app_id": 107113422697949}, "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "initial-scale = 1.0, width = device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4076\"", "article_summary": "In a year when Fuck-You Republicans may yet constitute a plurality of primary voters, decency is no asset.\nTrump came into the debate as the tribune of the Fuck-You Republicans, who share his belief, as he stated at one point in the evening, that, \u201cWe don\u2019t have time for tone,\u201d by which he meant any regard for anyone who might conceivably question his ego.\nChris Christie is a characterological Fuck-You Republican; Cruz, as we\u2019ve noted, is a strategic one; Scott Walker, somewhat oxymoronically, is a quiet one but, in matters of governance, a Fuck-You Republican nonetheless.\nHell, the entire Republican right now consists entirely of Fuck-You Republicans; that\u2019s why John Boehner can\u2019t get anything through the House.\nOf the Midwestern governors, John Kasich came off far better than Scott Walker, who tended to fade into the woodwork."}
