BLOOMING GROVE, Pa. (AP) â€” Authorities are hunkering down in the overnight darkness of the wooded northeast Pennsylvania neighborhood where a man suspected of the fatal ambush of a state police trooper lived with his parents.

Roads are still closed early Saturday as state police continue their search for 31-year-old Eric Frein (FREEN) in the Pocono Mountains. An unmarked helicopter was flying overhead, its lights off.

State police told residents Friday night in the townships of Price and Barrett to stay inside and asked others not to travel to Barrett Township because of heavy police activity. A dispatcher says shots were fired several hours earlier.

Authorities are hoping to catch the gunman they allege opened fire on a state police barracks a week ago, killing Cpl. Bryon Dickson and wounding a second trooper.
