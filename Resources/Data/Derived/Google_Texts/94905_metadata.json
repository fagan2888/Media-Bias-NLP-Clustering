I\u2019m so obsessed with her, I think I am her. I\u2019m a gladiator. I\u2019m Olivia.\u201d\n\nSo she\u2019s a problem-solver? \u201cYes, I am!\u201d the Oscar winner told VF Daily. \u201cOh my god, don\u2019t you notice I\u2019m solving everyone\u2019s problems? And I\u2019m like, Oh my god, I\u2019m Olivia Pope**!\u201d\n\nShe hasn\u2019t yet heard from Kerry Washington, but Hudson says she hopes she likes the video. (Watch it below.)\n\nHudson\u2019s role as a drug addict in Mister and Pete was much more somber. She worked with an addiction coach to help her make the character realistic, and she spoke to several other recovering addicts, one of whom she connected with. She joined Hudson at the screening. \u201cI didn\u2019t have as much to pull from from within, so I wanted to find someone that I could draw from, that I could love, that I could care about, and whose story I wanted to tell,\u201d Hudson told VF Daily.\n\nThe movie is about two boys who spend a summer in Brooklyn on their own while their mothers are in prison. Did Hudson ever run around Chicago, unsupervised, as a kid? \u201cOh, my mother didn\u2019t allow that! No, sir,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cMy mother was very strict. None of that for me.\u201d\n\nAlicia Keys was a producer on the film and also composed the soundtrack. Although it is not a musical, director George Tillman Jr. says that occasionally Keys and Hudson would break into song. \u201cIn between the takes, you can hear them singing here and there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was amazing.\u201d\n\nKeys laughed when we asked if she and Hudson had a musical connection on set. \u201cShe breaks out in song all the time, and she was on set more than I was, as the executive producer,\u201d Keys said. \u201cBut yes, we love to sing, so it\u2019ll happen. You never know.\u201d\n\nThe Cinema Society and co-host Tommy Hilfiger came up with a unique venue for the post-screening reception: Keys\u2019s West Chelsea recording studio. The party, on the building\u2019s top floor, was spread over multiple rooms\u2014some packed with sound-mixing equipment, requiring partygoers to leave their drinks at the door as they entered.\n\nThe studio is apparently a magnet for musical talent. Just as VF Daily approached the building, Mary J. Blige came out and stepped into a waiting car.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The actress and singer teamed up with Funny or Die to raise awareness about the Affordable Care Act.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9Net 2016", "author": "Bennett Marcus", "og": {"site_name": "Vanity Fair", "description": "The actress and singer teamed up with Funny or Die to raise awareness about the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Jennifer Hudson on Playing Olivia Pope in Her Scandal Parody:  \u201cI\u2019m So Obsessed with Her, I Think I Am Her\u201d", "url": "http://www.vanityfair.com/style/2013/10/jennifer-hudson-olivia-pope-parody", "image": "http://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54caac0c7e4b004120bc469a/4:3/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/image.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.vanityfair.com", "description": "The actress and singer teamed up with Funny or Die to raise awareness about the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Jennifer Hudson on Playing Olivia Pope in Her Scandal Parody:  \u201cI\u2019m So Obsessed with Her, I Think I Am Her\u201d", "image": {"src": "http://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54caac0c7e4b004120bc469a/master/pass/image.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 7802537, "app_id": 1591153417872059, "pages": 8810407571}, "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "keywords": "Parties,Parties,New York City,Movies,Scandal", "pubdate": "2013-10-03T11:20:00Z", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0f08\"", "article_summary": "And I\u2019m like, Oh my god, I\u2019m Olivia Pope**!\u201dShe hasn\u2019t yet heard from Kerry Washington, but Hudson says she hopes she likes the video.\n\u201cI teamed up with Funny or Die in their effort to raise awareness about the health-care bill,\u201d Hudson explained of how the viral video came to be.\nAlthough it is not a musical, director George Tillman Jr. says that occasionally Keys and Hudson would break into song.\nI\u2019m so obsessed with her, I think I am her.\n\u201cIt was amazing.\u201dKeys laughed when we asked if she and Hudson had a musical connection on set."}
