The analysis found that if current law were left unchanged, the U.S. government\u2019s fiscal deficits would total $7.2 trillion between 2016 and 2025. If the president\u2019s budget were enacted, the country would instead add $6 trillion to the national debt as increased spending is offset by higher revenue from the president\u2019s proposed tax increases on top earners.\n\nRelated: The Federal Debt Is About to Become a Big Issue Again\n\nThe report estimates that the president\u2019s budget would have little effect on the federal deficit in 2015 and would reduce the deficits relative to the current baseline every year from 2016 to 2025. Annual deficits would climb to $801 billion by 2025, compared to the current projection of $1.04 trillion. Public debt as a share of the economy would stay almost exactly where it is today, edging down from 74.1 percent in 2014 to a projected 73.1 percent in 2025.\n\nThe largest driver of savings in the president\u2019s budget is a dramatic cut in money directed to Afghanistan and other foreign military endeavors through the Overseas Contingency Operations fund. If current law were extended, that fund would be allocated $74 billion a year, with adjustments for inflation. The Obama budget foresees a cut to $58 billion in 2016, and then $27 billion a year going forward. That accounts for $532 billion in savings \u2014 nearly half of the difference between the president\u2019s 10-year deficit and current law.\n\nCBO also projects that the president\u2019s plan to close tax loopholes and eliminate some deductions and exclusions would bring in an additional $526 billion in revenue over 10 years. Proposed changes to the Medicare program would net out to $240 billion in reduced spending over 10 years. Comprehensive immigration reform would generate a net reduction of another $158 billion.\n\nRelated: 3 Reasons Why Americans Would Pay More Taxes\n\nThe savings are offset in part by increased discretionary spending of $371 billion over 10 years, and boosted by a reduction in net interest costs relative to current projections.\n\nA key point in most of the descriptions here is that they represent a \u201cnet\u201d effect on the budget. For example, Obama\u2019s proposal would generate some $1.8 trillion in additional revenue for the government through changes to the tax code and other laws. However, hundreds of billions of those dollars would wind up not in federal coffers, but redistributed back to other taxpayers through changes in allowable deductions, tax credits and other programs.\n\nOf course, the president\u2019s budget request in never adopted as written. In fact, it is ritually declared \u201cdead on arrival\u201d by the president\u2019s political opponents, after which Congress tries \u2014 and, lately at least, usually fails \u2014 to adopt a budget resolution of its own.\n\nOn Wednesday, before the CBO report was released, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Mike Enzi (R-WY) delivered remarks at a hearing that suggested that Obama\u2019s budget, which adds to the deficit every year \u2014 just less than current law would \u2014 is going to be a particularly hard sell with the GOP.\n\nRelated: 70 Percent of Americans Don\u2019t Know the Woman Pulling Their Purse Strings\n\n\u201cOver the past six years, we have learned that wasteful Washington spending doesn\u2019t solve problems, it only side-steps them,\u201d he said. \u201cBy spending responsibly and putting our fiscal books in order in a balanced and responsible way, we can restore the trust that we have broken with the American people.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cA balanced budget is essential for strong economic growth and job creation\u2026.This is not only possible, it is doable and it is what the American people want and deserve.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "President Obama\u2019s proposed 2016 budget would trim federal deficits by $1.2 trillion ov", "title": "Obama Budget Adds $6 Trillion to Deficits Over 10 Years: CBO", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/12/Obama-Budget-Adds-6-Trillion-Deficits-Over-10-Years-CBO", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05312012_Obama_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/12/Obama-Budget-Adds-6-Trillion-Deficits-Over-10-Years-CBO", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05312012_Obama_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "President Obama\u2019s proposed 2016 budget would trim federal deficits by $1.2 trillion ov", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf2f7\"", "article_summary": "President Obama\u2019s proposed 2016 budget would trim federal deficits by $1.2 trillion over the coming 10 years when compared to current law, the Congressional Budget Office said Thursday.\nThe analysis found that if current law were left unchanged, the U.S. government\u2019s fiscal deficits would total $7.2 trillion between 2016 and 2025.\nOf course, the president\u2019s budget request in never adopted as written.\nThe largest driver of savings in the president\u2019s budget is a dramatic cut in money directed to Afghanistan and other foreign military endeavors through the Overseas Contingency Operations fund.\nAnnual deficits would climb to $801 billion by 2025, compared to the current projection of $1.04 trillion."}
