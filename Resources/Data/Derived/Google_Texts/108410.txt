Matt Kellogg, a lobbyist for an oil and gas industry group, is heading to work for House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Monday .

Kellogg, who has served as the general counsel for the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) since 2011, will be working on finance and energy issues for the GOP leader.

ADVERTISEMENT “Matt will bring a unique perspective to the House Majority leader’s office, with his extensive understanding of the U.S. oil and gas industry and the important role America’s independent producers play in supplying abundant, affordable energy to American families,” Neal Kirby, a spokesman for IPAA, wrote in an email to The Hill. “We wish him well in his new endeavors.”

This isn’t Kellogg’s first time on Capitol Hill.

He previously served as a legislative assistant for Rep. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.), a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, and assisted with tax policy and energy tax issues.

Politico Pro was the first to report the move.
