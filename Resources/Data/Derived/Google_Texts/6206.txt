The Federal Trade Commission is suing a group of companies and their owners for allegedly scamming people into buying antivirus and other software.

The companies allegedly posed as technicians for major technology companies including Microsoft, Google and AT&T.

On Friday, the FTC, which filed the complaint along with the states of Pennsylvania and Connecticut, published a sealed ruling from a federal judge freezing the assets and placing a temporary restraining order on the companies and their owners.

The judge in Pennsylvania handed down the ruling late last month.

The consumer protection agency is now trying to recoup the millions of dollars that the companies allegedly bilked from customers. The exact dollar amount was not included.

The companies charged are Click4Support, IsourceUSA, Innovazion, and Spanning Source. Four of the companies’ owners were cited in the complaint.

The trade commission alleged the companies used pop-up warnings and ads online that appeared to be from well-known technology companies to trick people into believing their computers were infected with viruses.

People were directed to a phone number, where telemarketers led people to believe they worked for the well-known tech giants. According to the FTC, customers were then “given a high-pressure sales pitch for unnecessary tech support services.”

In last month’s ruling, Judge Stewart Dalzell ruled the FTC had a strong likelihood of success in proving that the companies violated multiple consumer protection laws.

“An asset freeze as to Defendants is necessary in order to preserve the possibility of complete and meaningful relief in the form of disgorgement and/or consumer redress at the conclusion of this litigation,” the judge ruled.

The judge also ruled there was cause to gain access to the company’s property, freeze its phone service and suspend its websites. Many of the websites named in the FTC complaint remained accessible to the public Friday afternoon.
