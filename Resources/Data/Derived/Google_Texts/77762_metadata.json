He estimates that a dozen or so have less than 10 days\u2019 cash on hand to pay operational expenses.\n\nSchott said the loss of a local hospital hurts the economy, because it\u2019s often one of the community\u2019s largest employers. He added that a lot of companies don\u2019t want to move their business to a community if nearby hospital care isn\u2019t available.\n\nComplying with the federal requirement that hospitals convert to an electronic medical records system has been hard for several rural hospitals. Roger Knak, CEO of Fairview Regional Medical Center in Major County, said the facility was down to four days\u2019 cash on hand to pay expenses around a year ago, which he largely blamed on the records system requirement.\n\nKnak said a 2 percent reduction in reimbursement for treatment of Medicare patients also has hurt the hospital\u2019s finances.\n\nHe said hospitals were told they could expect an increase in the percentage of insured patients because of the Affordable Care Act to offset other increased costs. But he said Major County still has 21 percent of its residents uninsured.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been struggling for almost three years to replace a physician who left us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are facing an extreme difficulty getting physicians to choose to practice in a rural part of the state. The cost of recruiting goes up and the difficulty in maintaining physicians goes up.\u201d\n\nHospital officials indicate that requests for more financial help are likely, both in the form of Congressional action to improve reimbursement rates and requests for financial assistance from local governmental entities.", "article_metadata": {"description": "OKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 Experts say many of Oklahoma\u2019s rural hospitals are struggling financially, with several of the facilities putting the blame on a requirement to convert to an electronic medical records system.Hospital consultant Val Schott told The Oklahoman that a high number of the state\u2019s rural hospitals are struggling to pay their expenses.
