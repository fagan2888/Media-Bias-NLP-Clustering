Dianne Feinstein, California Democrat and her party\u2019s ranking member on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, flatly stated that she believes terrorist cells are hiding in Europe and the U.S., waiting to be activated and carry out attacks similar to the ones that claimed 17 lives in France last week.\n\n\u201cI think there are sleeper cells not only in France but certainly in other countries and, yes, in our own,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cThis calls for vigilance. \u2026 Hopefully, we can be more active in terms of doing those things which enable us to find terrorists, see who they\u2019re communicating with and to track that.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Top 10 U.S. fighter jets\n\nMrs. Feinstein and Obama administration officials did not elaborate on how many suspected terrorists are in the country, nor did they discuss details of any terrorist plot.\n\nDespite the apparent lack of specific threats, polling data show the American people are deeply worried about a strike in the U.S.\n\nA Rasmussen poll released Sunday shows that 65 percent of Americans believe it is at least somewhat likely that an attack \u201con those critical of Islam\u201d in the U.S. will occur over the next year. Just 26 percent said such an attack is not likely, the survey shows.\n\nPHOTOS: Magazines can't agree on the sexiest woman alive; you be the judge\n\nThe poll was released just days after a string of terrorist attacks shook France. The violence began Wednesday with a mass shooting at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, where 12 people were killed.\n\nAt least 1 million people \u2014 including more than 40 world leaders such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2014 marched in Paris on Sunday to honor the victims of last week\u2019s attacks and to rally for unity and freedom of expression.\n\nThe U.S. sent only its ambassador to France, Jane Hartley. Even Russia sent a higher-ranking official to the rally in Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.\n\n\u201cToday, Paris is the capital of the world,\u201d said French President Francois Hollande. \u201cOur entire country will rise up toward something better.\u201d\n\nOutgoing U.S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. was among those in Paris on Sunday, though he was not seen at the march, according to media reports. He appeared on at least four Sunday morning political television shows in an attempt to reassure the American public that the administration is doing all it can to counter extremism.\n\nThe White House also announced that Mr. Obama would host an anti-extremism summit Feb. 18. The gathering will focus on efforts to stop the radicalization of Americans by terrorist groups such as al Qaeda and the Islamic State, and ways to combat terrorist recruiting efforts.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Holder said the federal government is keeping a close eye on individuals who may be part of the sleeper cells Mrs. Feinstein is warning about.\n\n\u201cWe are constantly evaluating where we stand with regards to those people who we have suspicions about. We have a universe of people who we focus on using legitimate means and keep track of them,\u201d Mr. Holder said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cThe American people should feel secure in what it is we do. \u2026 We are doing, as I said, the best we can.\u201d\n\nBut lawmakers believe more must be done in the wake of the attacks in France, which started when brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi stormed the Charlie Hebdo offices. The men targeted the paper because it published cartoons mocking Muhammad, Islam\u2019s prophet. Al Qaeda\u2019s branch in Yemen said it directed the attack.\n\nA day later, another terrorist, Amedy Coulibaly, killed a police officer and then took hostages inside a kosher market before police raided the building. Over the weekend, video emerged of Coulibaly pledging allegiance to the Islamic State.\n\nThe Kouachi brothers reportedly had weapons training in Yemen and were still able to travel back to France and carry out attacks. American lawmakers fear foreign fighters, after receiving training in Yemen or elsewhere, could travel to the U.S. and unleash violence.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had thousands of these Western travelers that have become foreign fighters in Iraq, Syria and Yemen that pose a threat and a risk of returning to where they came from and to do the same thing we saw in Paris,\u201d Rep. Michael T. McCaul, Texas Republican and chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said during a Sunday appearance on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on CBS.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a good handle intelligencewise of who is on the ground in Syria, Iraq and Yemen to identify them and put them on no-fly lists so they can\u2019t get into the country,\u201d he said. \u201cEurope has to strengthen and tighten its travel restrictions. We need to look at protecting this country.\u201d\n\nBoth Mr. McCaul and Mrs. Feinstein singled out the U.S. visa waiver program as a potential problem area. The program allows citizens from some countries to enter the U.S. without a visa.\n\nMrs. Feinstein called it \u201cthe Achilles\u2019 heel of America\u201d and said it must be reformed.\n\n\u201cThey can come back from training, they go through a visa waiver country and they come into this country,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a big problem here.\u201d\n\nMoving forward, Mr. McCaul said, the House Homeland Security Committee will launch an investigation into potential security gaps in the visa waiver program or other areas that may allow foreign fighters to make their way to the U.S.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A key senator said Sunday she believes there are terrorist sleeper cells in the U.S. that could carry out attacks similar to the ones in France that left 17 people dead last week.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A key senator said Sunday she believes there are terrorist sleeper cells in the U.S. that could carry out attacks similar to the ones in France that left 17 people dead last week.", "title": "Dianne Feinstein: Terrorist sleeper cells are in the U.S.", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/11/dianne-feinstein-terrorist-sleeper-cells-are-us/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/25/cia.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/25/cia.jpg", "description": "A key senator said Sunday she believes there are terrorist sleeper cells in the U.S. that could carry out attacks similar to the ones in France that left 17 people dead last week.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Dianne Feinstein: Terrorist sleeper cells are in the U.S."}, "Author": "Ben Wolfgang", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Dianne Feinstein, France, Paris"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaa27\"", "article_summary": "PHOTOS: Magazines can't agree on the sexiest woman alive; you be the judgeThe poll was released just days after a string of terrorist attacks shook France.\n\u201cI think there are sleeper cells not only in France but certainly in other countries and, yes, in our own,\u201d she told CNN.\nIn the meantime, Mr. Holder said the federal government is keeping a close eye on individuals who may be part of the sleeper cells Mrs. Feinstein is warning about.\nMrs. Feinstein called it \u201cthe Achilles\u2019 heel of America\u201d and said it must be reformed.\n\u201cThey can come back from training, they go through a visa waiver country and they come into this country,\u201d she said."}
