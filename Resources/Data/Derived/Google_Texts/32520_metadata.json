The only problem is, Air Force thrives with an offense based on the ground game.\n\n\u201cI knew about the offense when I came here,\u201d said Robinette, a junior from Bexley, Ohio. \u201cWe\u2019re a run-first team, but we can throw the ball a little and with some trickery that might catch the defense sleeping.\u201d\n\nRobinette has been part of the trickery. He is 2-for-2 with two touchdowns on passes off reverses.\n\nBut his real value is as a pass receiver \u2014 and as a blocker in the running game. He has 20 catches for 562 yards this season, an average of 28.1 yards per catch, and four touchdowns.\n\nRobinette had his biggest game of the season Nov. 14 against Utah State, when he made seven catches for 210 yards \u2014 including a 74-yard touchdown. The 210 yards were the most receiving yards for an AFA player in a game since 1978.\n\n\u201cHe continues to learn and improve,\u201d Air Force coach Troy Calhoun said of Robinette. \u201cOne of the areas he\u2019s improved immensely this year is in his point-of-attack blocking. He has been a force as a blocker, so he\u2019s learning different ways to contribute.\u201d\n\nThe Falcons (8-3, 6-1 Mountain West) play their regular-season finale Saturday night at New Mexico. They have already clinched the Mountain Division title and will play San Diego State on Dec. 5 in the conference championship game.\n\nIrv Moss: 303-954-1296, imoss@denverpost.com or @irvmoss\n\nSaturday\u2019s area college games:\n\nNoon UNLV at Wyoming, ROOT\n\n12:30 p.m. Colorado at Utah, PAC-12\n\n7 p.m. Colorado State at Fresno State, CBSSN\n\n8:15 p.m. Air Force at New Mexico, ESPNU", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jalen Robinette, Air Force wide receiver, shows off his gift of the grab", "title": "Jalen Robinette, Air Force wide receiver, shows off his gift of the grab", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/27/jalen-robinette-air-force-wide-receiver-shows-off-his-gift-of-the-grab/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151127__87b4a157322cbf33870f6a70670067adp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151127__87b4a157322cbf33870f6a70670067adp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-27T17:55:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T04:08:20+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Air Force Academy"}, "article_summary": "AIR FORCE ACADEMY \u2014 At first glance, one might wonder what Jalen Robinette is doing at the Air Force Academy.\nThe only problem is, Air Force thrives with an offense based on the ground game.\n\u201cHe continues to learn and improve,\u201d Air Force coach Troy Calhoun said of Robinette.\nHe is a 6-foot-4, 215-pound wide receiver who has double-digit catches per game written all over him.\nIrv Moss: 303-954-1296, imoss@denverpost.com or @irvmossSaturday\u2019s area college games:Noon UNLV at Wyoming, ROOT12:30 p.m. Colorado at Utah, PAC-127 p.m. Colorado State at Fresno State, CBSSN8:15 p.m. Air Force at New Mexico, ESPNU"}
