Jim Webb (D-Va.) has emerged as the trendy answer to the question of who, if anyone, will mount the most serious challenge to Hillary Clinton Hillary Rodham ClintonClinton: I'm ready for Trump's 'fantasy' campaign Overnight Energy: Trump outlines 'America First' energy plan in North Dakota The Trail 2016: Interleague play MORE for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. Webb, who served only one term as senator from Virginia and has limited name recognition nationally, has formed the dreaded \u201cexploratory committee\u201d and looks very likely to run. A recent spate of articles, sympathetic to Webb\u2019s politics and relatively bullish on his chances to make a sustained run in the primaries, have created the kind of insider \u201cbuzz\u201d reserved for candidates with more \u201cserious\u201d bipartisan bona fides than, say, Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersThe Trail 2016: Interleague play Clinton laughs off idea of Trump-Sanders debate Colorado gov sports Trump socks MORE.\n\nEvidently bored with the inevitability of Hillary, then, it looks like many in the media have settled on Webb as the other candidate to focus on, and he may therefore be the one who most casual followers of politics will assume is the only realistic alternative. With this in mind, it\u2019s worth looking closely at Webb\u2019s record, particularly since he is someone who has skillfully crafted a certain political affectation. And when one looks beneath the surface, one finds that, as with so many other media-friendly politicians, Webb\u2019s reputation is mostly a farce. But he has long presented himself as the sort of politician who disdains politics and yearns for some mythical political culture in which elected leaders are guided only by their high-minded principles. And mainstream pundits, of course, are eternal suckers for this kind of \u201cabove the fray\u201d posture. (The bookers of \u201cMorning Joe\u201d have probably already allotted dozens of hours of time for Webb in 2015.)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWeirdly, Webb has found fans on the left, right, and center of the media spectrum. Writing for The Week, Michael Tracey lavishes praise on Webb for his views on foreign affairs, economic policy, and even social issues, before advising Democrats to \u201cturn their gazes to Webb\u201d if they want a \u201cbetter way forward.\u201d Al Hunt of Bloomberg gushes over Webb with so much enthusiasm that it\u2019s virtually indistinguishable from campaign propaganda. We learn from Hunt that Webb\u2019s \u201ctrademarks\u201d are \u201cfearless and unpredictability.\u201d Indeed, he is a \u201cmaverick\u201d who would bring \u201cauthenticity\u201d to the race, and may be \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s worst nightmare.\u201d Wow. Even some conservatives find themselves seduced by Webb\u2019s charm: Noah Millman pronounces in The American Conservative that we \u201cdesperately need more people like him in our politics.\u201d The man is downright saintly.\n\nThe first thing to say about this sudden - albeit superficial - momentum for Webb is that it\u2019s genuinely bizarre. Jim Webb is a former Republican who endorsed George Allen for Senate in 2000. He has no particular constituency in the Democratic electorate. He was one of the most ideologically conservative senators in the Democratic caucus, but his supporters seem to think he can run to Hillary\u2019s left, and nobody will notice.\n\nMuch of the praise for Webb\u2019s policy credentials has to do with his sincere effort on reforming the criminal justice system and his opposition to empire. On the former, Webb deserves unqualified praise; he fought hard to bring attention to the issue of prison reform despite the limited political benefit involved. Some caveats do apply to his reputation for being anti-war, though. Webb is a hardened Vietnam veteran, not a dove (Webb said in 2007 that he \u201cstill strongly supports the Vietnam War\u201d). His objection to post-9/11 militarism has never included any kind of fundamental critique; his arguments have been of the \u201cstrategic error\u201d and \u201cnational interest\u201d variety. Nevertheless, Webb has certainly been more enlightened than many Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, on these two areas of policy.\n\nElsewhere, though, the record is not good. On climate, Webb was one of the worst Democrats in the Senate, as Ben Adler of Grist recently detailed. From cap-and-trade, to Copenhagen, to EPA regulations, he actively attacked anything remotely resembling progress on energy issues. He supports the Keystone XL pipeline and voted to force approval of it.\n\nKnown as a \u201cpopulist,\u201d Webb opposed his party\u2019s effort to raise taxes on income over $250,000, deeming it unfair to the rich. He was the only Democrat in the Senate to vote against reducing interest rates on student loans. Back in 2009, he joined other conservative Democrats in the Senate in effectively burying the Employee Free Choice Act, after corporations ratcheted up the pressure. This is a very strange kind of populism.\n\nWebb opposes affirmative action. He describes himself as a \u201cstrong supporter\u201d of the Second Amendment. On health care, Webb wanted President Obama to show more \u201cleadership,\u201d by which he meant pursue more modest legislation in order to draw Republican support (he voted for more than a dozen Republican amendments to the Affordable Care Act). Webb is also a proud supporter of the Confederacy. He thinks the Civil War is \u201cmisunderstood\u201d and he doesn\u2019t have any particular problem with the Southern states\u2019 decision to secede. This is, as the kids like to say, problematic.\n\nIn short, Jim Webb, who will be 70 years old on Election Day, is the exact opposite of what Democratic voters seeking an alternative to Hillary Clinton will be looking for. He\u2019s on the wrong side of numerous issues that progressives care about. Literally none of the conditions that allowed Obama to stage his upset of Hillary in 2008 apply to Webb today (most importantly, Webb cannot raise money on her level, and he cannot perform as well as Obama did among African-American voters). So let\u2019s stop pretending this ludicrous idea of \u201cJim Webb, Democratic nominee for President,\u201d is worth taking seriously.\n\nDoolittle is a freeloance writer based in New York City, with a M.A. in Public Policy from Stony Brook University.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Weirdly, Webb has found fans on the left, right, and center of the media spectrum.", "description": "Weirdly, Webb has found fans on the left, right, and center of the media spectrum.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Weirdly, Webb has found fans on the left, right, and center of the media spectrum.", "title": "Webb is not the man", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/227888-webb-is-not-the-man", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T04:47:50-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T04:47-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/227888-webb-is-not-the-man", "dcterms.date": "2014-12-23T17:00-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Justin Doolittle", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-23T17:00:02-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T04:47:50-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/227888-webb-is-not-the-man", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Weirdly, Webb has found fans on the left, right, and center of the media spectrum.", "card": "summary", "title": "Webb is not the man"}, "dcterms.title": "Webb is not the man"}, "article_summary": "So let\u2019s stop pretending this ludicrous idea of \u201cJim Webb, Democratic nominee for President,\u201d is worth taking seriously.\nWebb is a hardened Vietnam veteran, not a dove (Webb said in 2007 that he \u201cstill strongly supports the Vietnam War\u201d).\nNevertheless, Webb has certainly been more enlightened than many Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, on these two areas of policy.\nJim Webb is a former Republican who endorsed George Allen for Senate in 2000.\nOn climate, Webb was one of the worst Democrats in the Senate, as Ben Adler of Grist recently detailed."}
