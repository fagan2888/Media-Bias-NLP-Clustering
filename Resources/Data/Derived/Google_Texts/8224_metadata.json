As the crowd was filtering in to the National Mall, a band fired up the crowd with a rousing song that lampooned the belief in \u201cJesus coming again,\u201d mixing it with sexual innuendo. As the assembled crowd clapped and sang along to other songs satirizing religion, a large costumed puppet figure of Jesus danced among spectators. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to bash anyone\u2019s faith, but if it happens, it happens,\u201d comedian and master of ceremonies Paul Provenza announced to laughter and applause at the outset of the event. The bashing and attacks on religion, mainly Christianity (in its evangelical and Catholic forms), happened as much if not more than positive portrayals of secularism and were in sync with new atheist leader and scientist Richard Dawkins\u2019s advice to \u201cmock and ridicule\u201d people\u2019s beliefs. When one of the authors asked an official from the Secular Students Alliance, a group prominent in organizing the event, about whether the ridiculing of religion was productive, he answered, \u201cThis is what we do.\u201d\n\nThe rally was billed by its organizers as the \u201clargest secular gathering in human history,\u201d but it also revealed how organized atheism had gained a measure of unity, support, and traction in popular culture during the preceding decade. The rally, which was organized and sponsored by twenty atheist and secular humanist organizations, was widely reported to be a \u201ccoming-out party\u201d for atheists to publicly declare their unbelief and demand a place for themselves at the table. These objectives were not much different than those of its 2002 predecessor event called the \u201cGodless March on Washington,\u201d but the two gatherings had notable contrasts. The Reason Rally drew an attendance of over ten thousand (although secularists have tended to go with the highest estimates of twenty thousand), whereas the 2002 march barely attracted twenty-five hundred secularists. Dawkins, clearly the main attraction of the event (with the crowd chanting his name as he made his entrance to the stage), told the audience that the rally could represent the \u201ctipping point\u201d for atheism; the mass of people declaring their unbelief would help lead to a rising tide of \u201ceveryone else coming out\u201d as atheists. The atheists\u2019 interest in showing their numerical strength was on display at the rally, with the frequent claim made that they represent 16 to 17 percent of the population (taken from survey results showing a growth of unaffiliated\u2014though not necessarily secularist\u2014America).\n\nThere was a much larger presence of young adults and women at the rally than in 2002; the founding of the Secular Student Alliance and its rapid growth in colleges and high schools (doubling since 2009 from 143 campuses to 350) may be a factor in that change. Much of the success of the rally can be credited to the greater coordination and unity between the various secularist groups, ranging from such veterans as the American Atheists and the Freedom from Religion Foundation to the influential Center for Inquiry (CFI), Humanistic Judaism, and the well-funded Richard Dawkins Foundation.\n\nIn 2002 the fractious tendency of secularist groups was more evident, with several groups declining to participate. In 2012 even the more moderate American Humanist Association (AHA) took an active part in the rally; as AHA spokeswoman Maggie Ardiente told us in an interview, \u201cAtheism is the first step on the path\u201d to a more positive kind of humanism. The event featured the old standard-bearers of freethought; magician and veteran skeptic James Randi resembled a walking social type of the village atheist as he jabbed his cane toward the sky and railed against the \u201cmisogynistic, genocidal, sexist, racist, militaristic, and homophobic\u201d deity of the Old Testament. But the rally also showed how the new atheism and its professionalized, if polemical, style has raised secularism\u2019s status in the worlds of entertainment and popular culture, a subject we will address in the next chapter. The rally\u2019s performers, such as singer and comedian Tim Minchin, the rock group Bad Religion, comedian Eddie Izzard, and Adam Savage of the \u201cMythbusters\u201d TV show, blended hip and edgy humor and artistic sensibility in their atheist repertoires. These personalities and increasing numbers of other performers are prominent in the entertainment world while also finding a niche market among secularists, along with a host of bloggers with large followings.\n\nThe prominent role of celebrities and the calls for reason and coming out of the closet to claim a place in American society at the event were joined seamlessly with irreverent attacks on religion. The tension, if not conflict, between the secularists\u2019 strategies of debunking religion and calling for acceptance in a largely religious, if pluralistic, society was as apparent in 2012 as it was in 2002. This tension between celebrating and suppressing difference from a majority or norm is an issue with which many identity movements struggle (Bernstein 1997). Highlighting the difference from a religious majority can strengthen unity internally both positively (e.g., celebrating an intellectual superiority) and negatively (e.g., emphasizing the oppressiveness of religion). Highlighting similarities with a majority may broaden or extend a movement but may also decrease intensity within it. This question of how much attention to devote to internal issues, such as strengthening unity and increasing membership, versus reaching out and appealing or collaborating with other groups to achieve certain ends, is another issue that all movements have to grapple with and negotiate.\n\nMoreover, agreeing that a problem exists and needs to be addressed, and motivating people to do so, is not to agree on what should be done or how to go about doing it. The issue of gender relations is a recent example in which secularists split into factions over political concerns. A secularist blogger issued a call for a \u201cthird wave\u201d of atheism that would unite the politics of the left with a concern that women participants would be free of sexual harassment. She had in mind reports that women had been plagued with sexual harassment at atheist events, but the declaration ignited a bitter split whereby the leaders of the new movement, known as Atheism+, in effect excommunicated or \u201cdisowned\u201d dissenters from its platform (McGrath 2012). This example highlights how moving from the abstract to the concrete can divide individuals within a particular group (some secularists have dismissed sexual harassment within the movement as a nonissue), which perhaps helps explain why secularists place so much emphasis on where they do agree. Also, until a constituency of like-minded people come together and decide to act, practical matters regarding strategies and goals are not really an issue. Focusing on broad areas of agreement is a first initial step in establishing a base, whereas getting too specific can turn subgroups against one another.\n\nResearch in human psychology suggests that individuals are more likely to act to avoid dire consequences than to seize new opportunities (Quattrone and Tversky 1988). And the threat of religion\u2014 whether in the form of the religious right and the threat of dissolving the separation of church or 9/11\u2014is arguably one of the main triggers motivating secularists to act. The proclamation that they are not necessarily against religion but irrationalism may help, perhaps functioning to broaden appeal as well.\n\nMany participants in these groups still believe that they are in the forefront of secularism and progress. Humor is an important device for declaring the superiority of freethought and secularism over religious thought. Moreover, humor can be used to gain mainstream acceptance. As Herbert, a humanist lawyer at the march, noted, \u201cNothing should be off limits. Why should religion get a pass? One of the ways to have a secular society is for people to be able to laugh at themselves. That\u2019s the important first step.\u201d He also added that the \u201cabsurdities of religion have to be exposed. Why shouldn\u2019t religion be held up for ridicule just because most people have [religious beliefs]? Why do we have to hush up just because more people believe than don\u2019t believe?\u201d A forty-one-year-old atheist activist from California remarked, \u201cWe all make fun of everything, including free thought. In a free marketplace of ideas, everything is open to ridicule. If there is something that can\u2019t be made fun of, then there\u2019s something wrong.\u201d\n\nAs civil right struggles have shown, one of the ways social identities become politically salient is in opposition to discrimination, highlighting a discrepancy between the promise and the practice of the democratic process in respect to the (unequal) distribution of goods and rights. In the wake of the civil rights movement, many new groups\u2014from feminists to gays to religious fundamentalists\u2014 have taken up the discourse of identity to struggle for equity and recognition in the political arena. Atheists are following suit in their claim that they are an embattled minority in need of rights and even protection in a religious and hostile society, tacitly acknowledging the failure of widespread secularism. Both Free Inquiry and as our interviews feature frequent use of language expressing a minority identity and status, often taken from minority and identity politics, calling for atheists and secular humanists to engage in greater activism to protect their rights.\n\nThis point was illustrated in an interview with Paul, a fifty-six-year-old businessman in the Washington, D.C., area, during the Godless March on Washington in 2002. For Paul, the process of coming out as an atheist was gradual. He was raised in a conservative Lutheran home. \u201cThe first step is realizing that you don\u2019t believe what everyone else believes. Then this little voice in your head [starts] saying that you\u2019re going to hell. . . . The [next] step is saying, \u2018I\u2019m an atheist,\u2019 and then saying, \u2018I\u2019m an atheist and proud of it.\u2019 That\u2019s the more difficult step.\u201d In his own personal life, he said, \u201cit\u2019s traumatic to be surrounded by a community that is hostile to you. It\u2019s not politically correct to disrespect blacks, gays, or the handicapped, but it\u2019s still all right to disrespect atheists. . . . Religious people are usually the extremists, and they represent a much larger group. But they consider us not to be fully human. One of the things that rule your life when you\u2019re an atheist is fear. You never know when you\u2019re going to be attacked.\u201d This fear is two-sided. On the one hand, it can lead to paralysis and apathy. On the other, it can lead to action. As the social movement literature suggests, the course such emotions take is contextual and would depend on whether resources and support are in place to channel such threats and anxieties into activism.\n\nWith greater exposure comes greater criticism. In recent years, several organizations, such as the Atheism Anti-Discrimination Support Network, have formed to counter discrimination and build a political identity. Addressing a New York secular humanist meeting, Margaret Downey, the network\u2019s director, said that she wanted to \u201cempower the atheist community so we don\u2019t become easy victims of prejudice.\u201d Regarding one Christian television commentator who voiced a negative opinion on atheists, she commented, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to change her religious views, just her prejudice.\u201d\n\nIn the secularist movement\u2019s meetings, blogs, and online forums, much debate takes place about what name might make for a more positive self-image among Americans than atheist or secular humanist. The media devoted some attention to the effort among one group of atheists to substitute \u201cBrights\u201d for the older terms, but little agreement exists in practice on actually adopting that term (Shermer 2003). New atheist spokesman and scientist Richard Dawkins argued that adopting the name \u201cbrights\u201d and forsaking the older designations would be an exercise in consciousness-raising (Dawkins 2003). Replacing derogatory terms of the past with more positive ones (or reappropriating them) is a tactic frequently employed by many once-stigmatized minority groups seeking to gain a place for themselves in American society, from African Americans to gay rights activists. One could even call such a move a standard strategy of contemporary identity politics. As Grant Farred (2000: 638) writes, \u201cThe struggle for identity has often turned on the capacity of marginalized groups to set their own political agenda, simultaneously acknowledge, reject, and reinscribe the disjuncture between \u2018identities imposed\u2019 and those desired.\u201d\n\nAtheists want to mobilize to challenge and eliminate the stigma associated with nonbelief. However, in mobilizing and articulating claims they need to use the stigmatized identity they aim to change. In doing so, and in seeking recognition, they run the risk of strengthening the biased social category of nonbelief they aim to overturn insofar as it suffers from historical stereotypes and is associated with negative characteristics and carries negative connotations. \u201cThis is a dilemma both at the level of means, of how to get what you want, and at the level of ends, since moral dignity arises both from abolishing the stigma and from organizing politically\u201d ( Jasper 2010: 31). Sam Harris (2007) grapples with the dilemma in his controversial \u201cThe Problem with Atheism\u201d lecture, where he suggests, \u201cI think that \u2018atheist\u2019 is a term that we do not need, in the same way that we don\u2019t need a word for someone who rejects astrology. . . . All we need are words like \u2018reason\u2019 and \u2018evidence\u2019 and \u2018common sense\u2019 and \u2018bullshit\u2019 to put astrologers in their place, and so it could be with religion.\u201d He adds,", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some atheists want to celebrate difference, others want to join the political arena.
