For example, Dr. Kumar said, doctors may need to perform additional tests to help determine if a patient with high blood pressure has heart failure.\n\nICD-10 includes 68,000 diagnostic codes, compared with 14,000 in the current compendium. The number of codes for inpatient hospital procedures will expand to 87,000, from 4,000.\n\nConsumers often need prior approval from insurers for expensive tests and medical procedures. To get approval, they need a valid diagnostic code.\n\nDr. Michael R. Marks, an orthopedic surgeon and coding expert in Connecticut, said that if doctors did not use the proper codes, insurers could delay approval. \u201cThe patient,\u201d he said, \u201cwill get frustrated and ask: \u2018Why has my M.R.I. not been authorized yet? Why has my surgery not been scheduled?\u2019 \u201d\n\nProfessional coders play an invisible but indispensable role in the health care system, reading through medical records and assigning codes to describe patients\u2019 conditions. Accurate coding helps ensure patients get the care they require. It is also a way to justify the services provided. The old codes, in use for more than 30 years, have not kept up with changes in medical technology and treatment.\n\nHealth care providers are racing to hire coders as the deadline approaches.\n\nCoders are \u201ca hot commodity,\u201d said Kevin M. Carpenter, director of health information management at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, who estimated that his hospital had spent $5 million preparing for the new codes. That includes the cost of upgrading information technology and training 1,000 doctors and 30 full-time coders.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe imminent shift dwarfs comparable changes. In 1983, Medicare started paying hospitals a fixed amount for each case, based on the diagnosis, but that was only for hospitals and Medicare patients. In 2014, under the Affordable Care Act, millions of people obtained Medicaid or subsidies for private insurance, but together those changes affected fewer than one in 10 Americans.\n\nBy contrast, the federal government says the new codes will be used by doctors and hospitals for virtually all patients.\n\nAs people make the change, doctors and hospital executives say, it is inevitable that some claims will be denied for services that were provided but not properly coded. Patients may see the denials in statements they receive from insurers.\n\nMany doctors and hospitals say they will step up efforts to collect the patient\u2019s share of the bill, including deductibles and co-payments, at the time of service.\n\nDoctors and hospitals can revise and resubmit claims to correct the codes. But that takes time and could delay reimbursement.\n\n\u201cWe fully expect delays in payment from some insurers,\u201d said Brenda L. Reetz, chief executive of Greene County General Hospital in Linton, Ind. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the cash flow of larger hospitals. So we got a $3 million line of credit from a bank, based on the money we expect to receive from Medicaid, Medicare, commercial insurers and patients.\u201d\n\nThe hospital has been training employees since November 2013, but Cathy Hadley, director of health information management at the county-owned hospital, said, \u201cIt will take us 35 percent longer to do coding.\u201d\n\nOn its website, Aetna says, \u201cMedical claims will be denied if they don\u2019t use the new ICD-10 codes\u201d for services provided on or after Oct. 1. Stacie Watson, an Aetna executive, said: \u201cWe are ready. Test results are encouraging. There should be very little disruption if providers and everyone else is ready.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Dr. Barbara L. McAneny, a cancer specialist in Albuquerque, expressed concerns. \u201cI don\u2019t think physicians are ready,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think health plans are ready.\u201d\n\nDr. McAneny, a trustee of the American Medical Association, said she and her 17-doctor group had taken out a $4 million line of credit to ensure they could pay expenses, including the cost of cancer drugs, if the new codes cause a delay in reimbursement.\n\nUse of the new codes, originally scheduled for October 2013, was delayed a year by the Obama administration and then pushed back another year by Congress.\n\nA Nashville bank, InsBank, is offering a special \u201cICD-10 Line of Credit\u201d to doctors in Tennessee. \u201cCash may come in slower than usual,\u201d said Blake J. Wilson, a vice president of the bank, but doctors must still pay rent, electricity bills and wages.\n\nInsurers, researchers and some doctors see many potential benefits in use of the new codes. Doctors will have to provide more information about the cause, severity and complications of an illness or injury.\n\n\u201cThat will require deeper assessment of the patient,\u201d Dr. Kumar said.\n\nThe new codes will also make it easier for insurers and federal officials to measure the results of treatment and the quality of care \u2014 factors increasingly used in deciding how much to pay doctors and hospitals.\n\nPublic health officials say the new codes will help them identify outbreaks of disease, causes of death and community health needs. Researchers say the data will help them evaluate new treatments and procedures.\n\nDr. Robert W. Lash, a diabetes specialist who is chief of staff at the University of Michigan Health System, said: \u201cICD-10 is a lot more work for many providers, with no obvious short-term payoff. But in the long run, we should gain a better understanding of illnesses and injuries and how to treat them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKaren Zupko, a coding consultant in Chicago, said orthopedics would be affected more than other specialties because the codes for fractures and injuries are particularly complex. One code in the old system may be replaced by dozens of new options.\n\nDr. Marks, a former president of the Connecticut Orthopaedic Society, gave an example: A doctor will be asked to specify whether a fractured thigh bone is in the right or left leg; whether the bone protrudes through the skin; whether healing is routine or delayed; and whether the bone fragments rejoin at the wrong angle, leaving the patient with a deformed limb.\n\n\u201cThe number of codes is exploding,\u201d Dr. Marks said. \u201cOn Oct. 1, we will be speaking a new language. It\u2019s like switching to German, after speaking English for 30 years.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150913210609, "twitter": {"description": "Under the new coding regime, government programs and private insurers will require doctors, hospitals, clinics and nursing homes to report vastly more information about the care they provide patients.", "title": "One Symptom in New Medical Codes: Doctor Anxiety", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/14/us/politics/one-symptom-in-new-medical-codes-doctor-anxiety.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003905422"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/14/us/14health-JP/14health-JP-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/14/us/politics/one-symptom-in-new-medical-codes-doctor-anxiety.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003905422", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/14/us/politics/one-symptom-in-new-medical-codes-doctor-anxiety.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 13, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Doctors,Hospitals", "news_keywords": "Doctor,Hospital", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Robert Pear", "SCG": "politics", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By ROBERT PEAR", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Under the new coding regime, government programs and private insurers will require doctors, hospitals, clinics and nursing homes to report vastly more information about the care they provide patients.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/14/us/14health-JP/14health-JP-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Under the new coding regime, government programs and private insurers will require doctors, hospitals, clinics and nursing homes to report vastly more information about the care they provide patients.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Sept. 13, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/robert_pear/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2015-09-14", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Hospitals", "published": "2015-09-13", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "14health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150914123605, "hdl_p": "One Symptom in New Codes: Doctor Anxiety", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/14/us/politics/one-symptom-in-new-medical-codes-doctor-anxiety.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/14/us/14health-JP/14health-JP-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Under the new coding regime, government programs and private insurers will require doctors, hospitals, clinics and nursing homes to report vastly more information about the care they provide patients.", "title": "One Symptom in New Medical Codes: Doctor Anxiety"}, "pdate": 20150913, "des": "Hospitals", "articleid": 100000003905422, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "One Symptom in New Medical Codes: Doctor Anxiety", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/14/us/14health-JP/14health-JP-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "Dr. Michael R.
