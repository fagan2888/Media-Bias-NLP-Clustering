This neglect may be disrupting their development.\n\nCell phones have completely overrun our society. From higher rates of car crashes to apps for detecting eye diseases, they affect us both positively and negatively. Adding to the list of negatives, though, a new study finds that too many parents are using up valuable time at the dinner table on their phones, rather than communicating with their children sitting right in front of them.\n\n\u201cWe know from decades of research that face-t-face interactions are important for cognitive, language, and emotional development,\u201d said study author Dr. Jenny Radesky, a fellow in developmental-behavioral pediatrics at Boston Medical Center, according to HealthDay. \u201cBefore mobile devices existed, mealtime would\u2019ve been a time where we would\u2019ve seen those interactions.\u201d\n\nStudies have shown that kids learn best through live interactions with their parents and other adults. One study found that interaction, even through video chat applications like Skype, were better than educational videos at teaching kids language and its mechanics with regards to conversation. Another study found that fathers who interacted with their children more put them at a lesser risk of behavioral problems later on. Being on a cellphone takes away a lot from time that should be better spent, especially because children tend to have inquiring minds.\n\nFor the study, researchers watched 55 random caregivers at fast food restaurants as they ate with one or more young children. They took notes about the caregivers\u2019 behaviors, and found that 40 of the caregivers used their phones or other devices during the meal, with 16 of them using it throughout the entire meal. \u201cThe girl keeps eating, then gets up to cross the room to get more ketchup. Caregiver is not watching her do this; she is looking down at the phone\u2026,\u201d the notes said, according to NBC. \u201cStill no conversation \u2026 Now girl\u2019s head appears to be looking right at caregiver, and caregiver looks up but not at girl\u2026\u201d\n\nOne child\u2019s efforts to get his father\u2019s attention led to being reprimanded for acting up \u2014 he was singing the parody of the song \u201cJingle Bells,\u201d \u201cJingle bells, Batman smells.\u201d Meanwhile some of those who \u201cappeared to accept this lack of engagement \u2026 seemed like they\u2019d given up,\u201d Dr. Rahil Briggs, director of pediatric behavioral health services at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, told HealthDay.\n\nAlthough the effects of parental cell phone use on their children hasn\u2019t been explored deeply, the looks that the researchers saw on the children\u2019s faces showed that they were affected in some way. The study, however, didn\u2019t look into how the children were treated once they got home, and children don\u2019t always need constant face-to-face interaction, Gedeon De\u00e1k, a cognitive science professor at the University of California, San Diego told NBC. Nevertheless, it\u2019s important for parents to find some kind of balance between cell phone use and spending time with their kids. Cell phones are \u201can essential tool,\u201d Radesky said. \u201cWhat we need to do is help build guidelines for the healthiest ways to use them. It\u2019s important for parents to have \u2018off\u2019 time where they tune in only to their child.\u201d\n\nSource: Radesky J, Kistin C, Zuckerman B, et al.
