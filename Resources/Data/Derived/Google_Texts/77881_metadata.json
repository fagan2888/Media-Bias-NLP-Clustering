The side-by-side New Tampa campuses on Imperial Oak Boulevard merged over the summer to give some relief to the overcrowded Turner, which enrolled 1,130 students last school year.\n\nFour weeks into the new school year, with many of the bugs worked out, Hillsborough County school district officials say the merger accomplished their goal of making room for students who need it without the expense of building a new school.\n\nTurner was filled to the brim because of growth in New Tampa. The community is drawing families with more young children than there are seats in the elementary school and no nearby elementary had room to spare.\n\n\u201cIt is more of a regional solution,\u201d said Rory Salimbene, the district\u2019s general manager of construction. \u201cBy converting some of our middle school spaces to elementary spaces, we more efficiently used the space we have.\u201d\n\nTo free space at Bartels, which enrolled about 850 students last year, attendance zones were redrawn to send a couple hundred students to Liberty and Benito middle schools.\n\nAs of last week, 1,800 students were enrolled at Turner/Bartels. Of those, 1,150 are in elementary school and 650 are in middle-school. It\u2019s now a student body comparable in size to one of the district\u2019s high schools. And there\u2019s room to grow to 2,311 students.\n\nOver the summer, district and school officials worked to join the two schools top to bottom in time for the students\u2019 first day.\n\nThe cost came to about $460,000, $300,000 of it for a new covered walkway to link the two schools. Other work included $180,000 to paint both campuses the same off-white color, as well as adding a digital message board, upgrading security fencing, redoing the gymnasium floor with the school\u2019s new logo, and replacing signs.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nWhat used to be the old Bartels Middle building now houses the \u201cupper campus,\u201d which includes classrooms for students in fourth through eighth grades, as well as some classes for third-graders. The \u201clower campus\u201d is for pre-kindergarteners through second-graders, as well as some third-graders.\n\nNew Principal Jonathan Grantham has an office on both campuses and rides a golf cart between them throughout the school day.\n\nSo far, things are running smoothly for the most part, thanks to good planning over the summer, Grantham said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s continuous improvement,\u201d said Grantham, who previously was principal of Roland Park K-8, a magnet school. \u201cThis whole year is going to be a process. Our goal is to get a little better every day.\u201d\n\nAll Turner/Bartels teachers were trained in infusing science, technology, engineering and math into their lessons, as the school now has a \u201cSTEM\u201d curriculum.\n\nTwo STEM coordinators \u2014 Angel Danger and Nicole Tuminella \u2014 are on staff to train and work with teachers.\n\n\u201cEvery conversation here has been geared toward STEM,\u201d Grantham said, even in English, physical education and music.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, music teacher Melissa Grady incorporated a science lesson into her class by having her students monitor how sound travels through different materials. They paired up and talked to each other through cups strung together with copper wire, fishing line or yarn.\n\n\u201cOur instruments do not work properly without STEM,\u201d Grady said. \u201cWhen they do this kind of thing, they can figure out how instruments work.\u201d\n\nWhen word spread last spring that the two schools would be combined, some parents were skeptical or downright opposed.\n\nThey didn\u2019t want 5-year-olds walking the same halls as 13-year-olds. They worried about younger and older children riding on the same school buses and feared it would be difficult to keep such a sprawling campus safe.\n\nSome worried the adjusted day would be too long for the younger kids. Turner\u2019s school day was previously six hours and 15 minutes and ran from 8 a.m. to 2:15 p.m. Bartels\u2019 school day lasted seven hours and 15 minutes, from 9 a.m. to 4:15 p.m.\n\nNow, school lasts six hours and 50 minutes, from 8:45 a.m. to 3:35 p.m. and parents have the option to drop their students off at a before-school program that begins at 6 a.m.\n\nBut the schedule is still a concern for some, including Enaye Englenton, who has children in the first and third grades at the school. Englenton said this adds to an \u201calready long day.\u201d\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nEven though they attend the same school now, the older kids rarely come into contact with the younger ones, Grantham said. When they do, it\u2019s because the school has organized an event. He says the older students serve as role models for the younger ones.\n\nBut a few weeks in, seventh-grader Liam Kilcommons said he and his fellow middle-school students miss having their own school.\n\n\u201cI wish they could have kept the elementary kids over there,\u201d Liam said.\n\nStill, the school year is going OK because \u201cthey don\u2019t bother us and we don\u2019t bother them.\u201d\n\nEnglenton said her biggest concern now is transportation, which she says the district should work to address.\n\n\u201cBuses routinely run late both in the mornings and afternoons,\u201d Englenton said in an email. \u201cThere continues to be a lack of supervision. This is a major concern when there are children ranging from ages 5-14 on the same buses.\u201d\n\nShe said Turner/Bartels administrators have done a great job at addressing parents\u2019 concerns.\n\nLike all principals, Grantham still hears complaints, but fewer than he did. He acknowledges transportation can be an issue but says it has improved.\n\nStudents, parents and staff are still getting used to the sheer size of the student body.\n\nFor Grantham, one of the toughest challenges is planning. For example, Grandparents Day in the past has been a one-day event. This year, it will be spread over three days.\n\nThird-grader Alexis Modonado, 9, who likes that her classroom is on the upper campus, sees the size of the school as a plus.\n\n\u201cWe get to do experiments around the whole school,\u201d Alexis said.\n\nSalimbene, the district\u2019s construction manager, expects that the school will eventually fill up and the district will reassess how to accommodate more growth.\n\n\u201cWe try to keep our schools so that they\u2019re not so large that it makes management even more difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you reach capacity and you can\u2019t address it by boundaries, the only alternative is to build.\u201d\n\nekourkounis@tampatrib.com\n\n(813)259-7999", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 14 Sep 2014 23:19:06 -0400", "Description": "NEW TAMPA \u2014 When students at Turner Elementary and Bartels Middle returned to school Aug. 19, they had a new bell schedule, new uniforms and a new focus on science, technology, engineering and", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "NEW TAMPA \u2014 When students at Turner Elementary and Bartels Middle returned to school Aug. 19, they had a new bell schedule, new uniforms and a new focus on science, technology, engineering and", "title": "New Hillsborough K-8 school allows for growth in New Tampa", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/education/new-hillsborough-k-8-school-allows-for-growth-in-new-tampa-20140914/", "image": {"width": 3603, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140914/ARTICLE/140919418/EP/1/1/EP-140919418.jpg", "height": 2565}, "updated_time": "2014-09-14T23:19:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "NEW TAMPA \u2014 When students at Turner Elementary and Bartels Middle returned to school Aug. 19, they had a new bell schedule, new uniforms and a new focus on science, technology, engineering a", "title": "New Hillsborough K-8 school allows for growth in New Tampa", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140914/ARTICLE/140919418/AR/0/AR-140919418.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-09-14T23:19:06Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-09-14T23:19:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "bartels middle school,turner bartels,turner elementary"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf955\"", "article_summary": "The community is drawing families with more young children than there are seats in the elementary school and no nearby elementary had room to spare.\nOf those, 1,150 are in elementary school and 650 are in middle-school.\nNew Principal Jonathan Grantham has an office on both campuses and rides a golf cart between them throughout the school day.\n\u201cEvery conversation here has been geared toward STEM,\u201d Grantham said, even in English, physical education and music.\nThe biggest change, though, is that all of them are now attending a single school \u2014 the new Turner/Bartels K-8."}
