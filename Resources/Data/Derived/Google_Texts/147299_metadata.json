First you have to motivate millennials.\n\nSo what\u2019s the biggest problem with Obamacare right now?\n\nThe botched website?\n\nIf only.\n\nAccording to Obama administration officials, that has mostly been fixed.\n\n\n\nThe more worrying issue threatening the Affordable Care Act is the marketing of the new legislation to those most crucial to the plan\u2019s viability\u2014the young and healthy, or as the health-care industry refers to them, the \u201cyoung invincibles.\u201d\n\nSo far, the advertising that\u2019s targeting the under-35 market has been abysmal.\n\nThe results have been embarrassing, even offensive.\n\nSome ads developed by two nonprofit groups in Colorado were so bad that Business Insider described them as \u201cmaking the internet cringe.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, while millions of dollars have been spent to attract the elusive millennial demographic, the response from young invincibles has been less than enthusiastic.\n\nAccording to recent data collected by CNN, as of last week, 21 percent of the total Obamacare enrollees were between 18 and 35. Analysts say the plan needs almost double that number to offset the health-care costs of older Americans and avoid a health care \u201cdeath spiral\u201d\u2014a prohibitive increase in premiums that could lead to the law\u2019s demise.\n\nAs with Obamacare\u2019s dysfunctional website, the most pressing question now about the marketing of the plan to young people is how to fix it.\n\nA good place to start is to focus on selling what this audience has most to gain from Obamacare\u2014the satisfaction of being a member of a society who believes universal access to health care is a fundamental human right and knowing that their enrollment in the plan enables the old and infirm to enroll affordably, too.\n\nAfter all, many of these young folks are the same people who responded so positively to the civically minded message\u2014\u201cwe are the ones we\u2019ve been waiting for\u201d\u2014of Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign.\n\nObama\u2019s success at turning out the youth vote in 2008 even triggered the advertising trade journal Ad Age\u2019s piece \u201cWhat Obama Can Teach You About Millennial Marketing,\u201d written for the benefit of consumer advertisers.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

Obama tapped into that in his first presidential run, but it seems to be lost on him now.\n\nOf the thousands of scholarly articles written on marketing to millennials and the millions of web entries devoted to the topic, many explore how 18- 35-year-olds are highly motivated to seek out brands that support a cause\u2014socially minded companies that have come to be known as \u201cidea brands.\u201d\n\nAs MillennialMarketing.com, a website devoted to decoding millennial consumer habits and marketing trends, explains, millennials are \u201csocially savvy consumers.\u201d Idea brands such as Toms Shoes and Warby Parker prescription eyewear, whose business models include a strong philanthropic focus, appeal to them because \u201cthey invite participation\u2026offer social value and align to a higher purpose.\u201d\n\nRight now, the yearning among young people to be a part of something bigger than themselves is so profound that crowd-funding\u2014collaborative online fundraising, largely composed of donors aged 24-35 \u2014raised $2.7 billion across the globe in 2012 and is projected to grow to $5.1 billion in 2013.\n\n\n\nPerhaps not coincidentally, one crowd-funding nonprofit in particular, Watsi, has been receiving a lot of attention lately. Founded last year by a 26-year-old ex-Peace Corps volunteer, the global platform allows online donors to fund medical treatment for people in developing countries without access to affordable health care.\n\nClearly, millennials are not averse to supporting a cause. Indeed, we know they\u2019re continually seeking alignment with a higher purpose. Of all people, Obama and his (usually adroit) message-makers should have had that in mind as they thought about marketing his most socially ambitious legislative initiative.\n\nIf they had run a more honest campaign, young Americans would be wearing their enrollment in the plan like a badge of honor, celebrating the idea that their being part of the risk pool reduces insurance premiums for the older and less fit members of the population.\n\nThe ads could have been fairly straightforward and much more dignified than those currently in circulation. In case you\u2019re curious, I\u2019ve included a rough layout of what one might look like.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "judithgrey"}, "keywords": "Obamacare, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201312031045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/business", "description": "The White House says the troubled HealthCare.gov has been fixed\u2014but what about the marketing campaign that\u2019s causing the Obamacare death spiral?
