The average ASRC shareholder owns 100 shares of stock and will receive $1,250. The other 2014 quarterly dividend distributions are scheduled for July, September and December. When the March dividend is paid, ASRC will have distributed a total of more than three quarters of a billion dollars in dividends since its incorporation, read a release from ASRC.\n\n\"This is a program that our shareholders have requested for some time, and we've listened,\" said ASRC president and CEO, Rex A. Rock, Sr. in a release last week. \"Thanks to a new digital stock management system we are finally able to make it happen, and I look forward to seeing the difference it can make in the lives of our owners.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Arctic Sounder - Serving the Northwest Arctic and the North Slope", "author": "Alaska Newspapers, Inc., Steve Keller designer and application developer", "og": {"description": "News from the region", "author": "Alaska Newspapers, Inc.", "url": "http://www.thearcticsounder.com/article/1406in_brief", "image": "http://www.thearcticsounder.com/graphics/am_logo_master.png", "title": "In Brief", "type": "article"}, "robots": "NOODP", "keywords": "news, alaska, arctic, north slope, barrow, alaska newspapers", "google-site-verification": "Fe0C9W2CZ8ooYp3qRTmPjC4_qn4aAUDjh1pe2Jy_f1o"}, "article_summary": "The other 2014 quarterly dividend distributions are scheduled for July, September and December.\nThe first quarterly dividend payment of $12.50 per share is scheduled for early March.\nKIC, ASRC dividends announcedKikiktagruk Inupiat Corporation (KIC) announced last week that shareholders will receive $3 per share this year as their annual dividend.\nKIC operates the Polaris dealership in Kotzebue, and Shaeffer added that the large Arctic Slope Regional Corporation dividend distributed late last year helped them out because of an influx of snowmachine sales.\nThe event is open to everyone in the community and they will also be signing up people for VA and Medicaid."}
