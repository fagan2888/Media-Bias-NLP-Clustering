In part because organizing in the private sector has become so difficult, unions have been focusing heavily on political advocacy. Journalist and unofficial labor historian Harold Meyerson, writing in the American Prospect, recently chronicled some of these efforts. Most have taken place at the local and state level, in places where liberals have the most influence: California, Seattle, New York City, and the like. But, as Meyerson notes, labor activists have also organized ballot measures to raise the minimum wage in Arkansas and Nebraska, among other states. They have also kept the pressure on Congress to raise the federal minimum wage, which still stands at $7.25 an hour, to $10.10.\n\nAchieving anything remotely like that would still be difficult, of course. SEIU\u2019s president, Mary Kay Henry, has apparently taken some grief for spending so much of the union\u2019s money on an effort unlikely to swell the organization\u2019s ranks anytime soon. But labor has always been at its best when it was an advocate for all working people, not just those paying dues. Unions were pivotal in creation of Social Security and Medicare (and Obamacare), for example. They also helped secure higher minimum wages and safer workplaces.\n\nThose achievements helped all Americans, by improving minimum standards for pay, benefits, and working conditions. Getting fast-food workers a raise\u2014whether it\u2019s by shaming or pressuring businesses into action, or securing new legislation\u2014could have similarly wide-reaching effects.\n\n\u2014Jonathan Cohn\n\nIn the news:\n\nIMMIGRATION: There have been two major developments over the last few days. First, the executive order on deportations that was supposed to come at the end of the summer may not come until after Election Day. Obama himself hinted at that on Thursday; Press Secretary Josh Earnest did the same thing on Friday. Aides are divided over whether the president should wait and, apparently, the president is still waiting for official word from his legal advisers on how much action the law would allow him to take. (Carrie Budoff Brown, Politico) Meanwhile, a federal immigration court has ruled that women who are victims of domestic violence can qualify for asylum status, setting a clear precedent that should allow many more women to make the same claim. One Fox News anchor apparently protested that it meant these women could get \u201cinstant U.S. citizenship plus our benefits.\u201d (Molly Redden, Mother Jones)\n\nDAY CARE: Over the last decade, at least 43 children died in Virginia\u2019s barely regulated at-home day cares, according to an investigation by reporters David S.
