It suggests Congressional conference committees, divorce settlement negotiations, and peace talks between warring factions all have a better chance of success if they take place in a dimly lit room.\n\nIt\u2019s not only that dusky conditions increase creativity, which can play a helpful role in forging compromise. This study suggests emotions\u2014positive and negative alike\u2014are heightened in the presence of bright light.\n\nIt seems our minds reflexively associate light with heat, and the notion of physical heat stimulates emotional heat. As a result, the intensity of light appears to increase the intensity of one\u2019s feelings\u2014a good thing if you\u2019re on a romantic fling, but problematic in situations that demand a dispassionate response.\n\n\u201cThese findings suggest a simple way to nudge people into being less emotional: by simply turning the lights down,\u201d write Alison Jing Xu of the University of Toronto and Aparna Labroo of Northwestern University. Their study is published in the Journal of Consumer Psychology.\n\nXu and Labroo describe five experiments that provide evidence for their thesis. Arguably the most telling one featured 98 university students who were randomly assigned to visit a brightly lit lab (with fluorescent ceiling lights turned on) or a dimly lit one (illuminated only by the light from computer monitors). They were told researchers were \u201ccollecting consumers\u2019 reaction to potential advertising plots and models.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Research shows that bright lights produce heightened emotions, while dusky conditions increase creativity", "title": "The fastest way to reach a congressional budget agreement?
