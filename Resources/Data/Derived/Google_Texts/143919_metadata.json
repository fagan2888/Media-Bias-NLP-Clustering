One of these rights was the right to adequate medical care, but what exactly is a right to adequate medical care?\n\nMany advocates for a constitutional right to medical care or healthcare believe in a Medicare-for-All option provided by the federal government. Supporters, like presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, believe this is one of the only economically viable options to achieve the goal of this proposed constitutional right. It requires raising taxes in the hopes of providing for as many Americans as possible.\n\nOther supporters just believe healthcare should be a right guaranteed to citizens for free. These supporters include students in the medical field who have the ambition to provide such care to the impoverished.\n\n\u201cEveryone deserves to have healthcare whether they have the money or not,\u201d said biology junior Sara Abouelniaj. \u201cOnce I get to be a successful doctor, I\u2019m planning to give people who cannot afford healthcare [the] healthcare that they need for free.\u201d\n\nThe concept of the right to adequate medical care seems well intentioned, and it has already been recognized since 1948 to be a universal human right by the United Nations. So why has the United States of America been one of the only major industrialized nations in the world to define medical care as a privilege and not a constitutional right?\n\nThe simple answer is that it creates a conflict of economic interests.\n\nMany free market advocates have vigorously denied that it is the state\u2019s responsibility to provide medical care. Some view it as a right that will eventually lead to a monopolistic form of healthcare. Others argue, like Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, that this right will force healthcare providers to provide services that they would otherwise not want to provide with from their own free will. Some of these believers include economics students.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it is constitutional to force one individual\u2019s work to be given to someone else at a price they don\u2019t get to set,\u201d said economics junior Stephen Nunez. \u201cI believe in private, mutually beneficial contracts; no monopolistic force [in healthcare].\u201d\n\nWhile advocates for the right to adequate medical care such as myself believe it is a right long overdue, it is important to have a real discussion on this issue. It is good to have opposing views on this topic because they can provide the limitations of our goal of everyone being provided with efficient medical care.\n\nIt is not as though advocates for private health insurance are against people having adequate medical care. In fact, I believe it is quite the opposite.\n\nThey would rather have people be able to choose their options from people who, in their view, have chosen to provide healthcare on their own standards; not the government\u2019s.\n\nMany advocates for private insurance, who are not otherwise affiliated with private insurance companies, are skeptical of the government\u2019s efficiency when it comes to providing such a responsibility to its citizens.\n\nThose who oppose the right to healthcare have a very interesting view of its definition. As I would define it, it would be similar in concept to the right to counsel (which is already provided by the United States Constitution). If you are unable to afford private health insurance or private medical care, then the state will provide for you.\n\nAlso, in response to those who question whether it is the government\u2019s responsibility to provide this to their citizens, look no further than the words of our nation\u2019s four-time elected president, Franklin Roosevelt:\n\n\u201cBetter the occasional faults of a Government that lives in a spirit of charity than the consistent omissions of a Government frozen in the ice of its own indifference.\u201d\n\nOpinion columnist Samuel Pichowsky is a political science sophomore and may be reached at [email protected]", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. is the only developed nation in the world that does not guarantee healthcare as a right to all it's people.
