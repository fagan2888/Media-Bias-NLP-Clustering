They\u2019re some of the brightest, most inspiring children.\n\nSo what does it take to adopt them?\n\n\u201cYou can be single, married, you can be a gay couple, it doesn\u2019t matter. We are looking for anyone who is safe and appropriate, that can open a loving home to these children,\u201d said CPS Adoption Preparation Specialist Casey Jordan.\n\nPrivate and international adoptions can cost tens of thousands of dollars, where adoption through foster care can cost as little as nothing.\n\n\u201cThe cost should never be an issue for people to adopt a child from foster care,\u201d said Kori Gough of Partnership For Children.\n\nThen there\u2019s assistance available for daycare, medical expenses, even college tuition.\n\nMany parents expect a baby when they adopt, but there are hundreds of teens, and siblings groups, who are in need of a loving home.\n\n\u201cI think it would be amazing for people to adopt teens. They\u2019re looking for their home. They\u2019re looking for their forever family, just like any other child,\u201d added Jordan.\n\n\u201cThere are amazingly beautiful children who have never had a real true family or the chance for a life with a forever family. And they\u2019re here in Central Texas, available,\u201d added Gough.\n\nThey are kids who are ready for consistency. The chance to live in one home and not have to move every year. The chance to fall in love with parents who will always be there for them.\n\n\u201cThere are teens now that have been in care since they were toddlers and they\u2019ve been waiting for year and years and years, and we have to keep telling them we\u2019re looking for you. We\u2019re looking and those families can look here in Texas because there are so many children that are waiting to be adopted,\u201d Jordan stressed.\n\nWaiting for someone like you, to become the forever family they\u2019ve been dreaming of.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "index, follow", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.twcable.twcnews", "og": {"site_name": "TWC News", "description": "Every week Jennifer Borget introduces you to a different child in foster care awaiting their forever family.
