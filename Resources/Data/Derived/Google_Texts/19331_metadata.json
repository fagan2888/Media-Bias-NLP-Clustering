The \u2018Bucket\u2019 List\n\nThe President adopted a new White House protocol. When matters of executive life get too hard to deal with, he\u2019s decided to \u201cbucket.\u201d The entire audience and the people watching at home, knew he probably meant two words that rhyme with bucket, instead.\n\n3. Obamacare\n\nWhat would a speech made by the president be without discussing his signature healthcare law, which helps all Americans get access to care even if they don\u2019t have a job. Of the healthcare policy he said:\n\n\u201cToday thanks to Obamacare, you no longer have to worry about losing your insurance if you lose your job. You\u2019re welcome Senate Democrats,\u201d Obama said.\n\n4.
