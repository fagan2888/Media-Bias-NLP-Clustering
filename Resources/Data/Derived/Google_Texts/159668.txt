In the minds of many conservatives, President Obama is a lawless Manchurian candidate, born in Kenya and who illegitimately holds the highest office in the land. Although Obama has long joked about so-called “Birthers” who have continued to demand the first African-American president produce his birth certificate, on his recent trip to Africa, the president added a new joke to his repertoire — predicting that he could win a third term.

“I actually think I’m a pretty good president — I think if I ran, I could win” Obama joked during his speech to the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia before quickly adding, “but I can’t!”:



Rather than threatening American conservatives with what may be their worst nightmare, Obama was actually lecturing African leaders who fail to respect constitutionally set term limits. Obama pointed to violence that erupted in the African nation of Burundi after that president unconstitutionally secured a third term.

“Now, let me be honest with you,” Obama said. “I do not understand this. I am in my second term. It has been an extraordinary privilege for me to serve as the President of the United States. I cannot imagine a greater honor or a more interesting job. I love my work. But under our Constitution, I cannot run again.”

President Obama argued that part of the reason why former South African president Nelson Mandela “forged a lasting legacy” is because he was “willing to leave office and transfer power peacefully.”

President Obama also spoke about a host of other issues that plague authoritarian regimes in the region. In Ethiopia, where the African Union is seated, journalist and critics of the government are routinely imprisoned. Ahead of Obama’s visit, the first ever for a sitting U.S. president, Ethiopia released five journalists who had been jailed for over a year on terrorism-related charges.
