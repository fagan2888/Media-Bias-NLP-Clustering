So the Medina woman -- whose medical care for cancer drove her into debt -- is joining President Barack Obama again, this time as he flies to Nashville, Tennessee, on Air Force One today.\n\nThe topic of today's speech at Taylor Stratton Elementary School in the suburb of Madison: Moving forward with the Affordable Care Act, or ACA.\n\nThat forward direction riles Republican ACA critics, especially since the U.S. Supreme Court last week ruled that Americans in every state are eligible for subsidies to help for health insurance premiums if they meet the income guidelines.\n\nThe court case was the second major legal hurdle the Obama White House overcame with the ACA, and the president said the court's 6-3 decision was a victory for all Americans.\n\nMedical bills -- and lack of insurance to cover them -- are the single biggest cause of personal bankruptcies, according to estimates using 2013 data. The ACA's requirement for nearly all Americans to have health insurance began in 2014. As he has before, Obama is likely to point out today how the ACA, also known as Obamacare, was designed to solve the medical-financial problem.\n\nCritics are likely to counter that even under the ACA, people can be liable for several thousand dollars in medical bills -- up to $13,200 for a family, due to deductibles and co-payments for the least-generous policies. But the sums are no longer staggering, ACA proponents say. And most plans have out-of-pocket limits significantly lower than the maximum, according to a study by Avalere Health.\n\nCanfield was a self-employed cleaning woman who wrote to Obama in 2009, telling him how her cancer treatments had left her in debt. She ultimately canceled coverage because of the high premiums. She worried that her bills would leave her homeless, but the Cleveland Clinic wound up treating her as a charity case because of her income.\n\nThe ACA, passed by Democrats in Congress in 2010, was designed to deal with these very problems, the White House said. It eliminated the direct link between health conditions and the cost of premiums, outlawed the ability to refuse insurance to anyone based on their health status, and limited the differences in premiums that old people and young people could be charged.\n\nThis required balancing out the costs between those who needed health care and those who didn't. It was achieved through the ACA's mandate that nearly everyone have insurance, a mandate that brought down or limited increases in premiums for some but that also resulted in higher premiums for others.\n\nThe mandate is still deeply unpopular among Republicans, and members of their party vying for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination say they will try to repeal the act if they win the office.\n\nCanfield's sister, Connie Anderson, will also be along on the Nashville trip, the White House said.\n\nCanfield has now been cancer-free for five years, the White House said. Her 2009 letter to the president still hangs in a frame at the White House.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, affordable-care-act, natoma-canfield, obamacare, obamacare. supreme-court, news", "title": "Medina woman joining President Obama again as he touts Affordable Care Act", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Medina woman joining President Obama again as he touts Affordable Care Act\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2015/07/medina_woman_joining_president.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/open_impact/photo/18236359-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"16423896\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-07-01T17:18:58Z\", \"author\": \"Stephen Koff, Northeast Ohio Media Group Washington Bureau Chief\", \"tags\": [\"affordable-care-act\",\"natoma-canfield\",\"obamacare\",\"obamacare. supreme-court\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cleveland.com/open_impact/photo/18236359-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@SteveKoff", "description": "Natoma Canfield's struggles to pay medical bills while dealing with cancer became a symbol in President Obama's crusade for the Affordable Care Act.", "card": "summary", "site": "@clevelanddotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Wednesday, July 01, 2015,  3:20 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.cleveland.com/open_impact/photo/natoma-canfield-53a6f7f204ee7e02.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"skoff\", \"author_nickname\": \"Stephen Koff, Northeast Ohio Media Group Washington Bureau Chief\", \"author_id\": \"2490\", \"source_blog_name\": \"OPEN: Ohio Politics\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "cleveland.com", "description": "Natoma Canfield's struggles to pay medical bills while dealing with cancer became a symbol in President Obama's crusade for the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Medina woman joining President Obama again as he touts Affordable Care Act", "url": "http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2015/07/medina_woman_joining_president.html", "image": "http://media.cleveland.com/open_impact/photo/18236359-thumb_square_large.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "cleveland.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Wednesday, July 01, 2015,  1:18 PM", "article_author": "Stephen Koff, Northeast Ohio Media Group Washington Bureau Chief", "Description": "Natoma Canfield's struggles to pay medical bills while dealing with cancer became a symbol in President Obama's crusade for the Affordable Care Act."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9fb7\"", "article_summary": "This required balancing out the costs between those who needed health care and those who didn't.\nCanfield's sister, Connie Anderson, will also be along on the Nashville trip, the White House said.\nSo the Medina woman -- whose medical care for cancer drove her into debt -- is joining President Barack Obama again, this time as he flies to Nashville, Tennessee, on Air Force One today.\nHer 2009 letter to the president still hangs in a frame at the White House.\nThe ACA's requirement for nearly all Americans to have health insurance began in 2014."}
