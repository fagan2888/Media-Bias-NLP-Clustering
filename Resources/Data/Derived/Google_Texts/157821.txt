Republican presidential hopeful Ben Carson and his family on Saturday rallied about 100 supporters at his campaign headquarters in Manchester, N.H., amid swirling rumors about the status of his campaign.

“I am in this,” Carson said, according to BuzzFeed News . “I’m not leaving. I’m not going anywhere.

ADVERTISEMENT “Maybe I should never go home for another change of clothes,” Carson joked, referring to his brief trip home to Florida earlier in the week that sparked false rumors he was ending his campaign during the Iowa caucuses.

“Do not let anybody – I don’t care who it is – tell you that I’m going anywhere,” he said. “They have written my obituary every week for the last year and half, and then they turn around and say, ‘He’s still here?’ ”

Carson’s wife, Candy Carson , recounted hearing about the rumors at two separate Iowa precincts.

“It’s not fair to us, but it’s not fair to Iowans,” she told supporters, according to BuzzFeed.

Carson’s son, Murray Carson, also addressed the room.

“I kept hoping and still hope that Cruz himself isn’t behind it,” he said. “I thought it was unfortunate that some people were deceived by that. But that’s politics I guess.”

Cruz said his campaign only spread a report from CNN.

He has apologized for not sending campaign staffers a follow-up message clarifying the report.

CNN denied reporting Carson was dropping out of the race.
