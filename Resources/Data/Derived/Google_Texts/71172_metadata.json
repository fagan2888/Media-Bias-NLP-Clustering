A midair crash was reported after 11 a.m. Tuesday between a Cessna 150C and an F-16 fighter jet based in Sumter, South Carolina. (Brad Nettles/staff)\n\nMONCKS CORNER \u2014 Air traffic control warned the pilot of an F-16C of approaching traffic roughly a minute before the midair collision that killed a Berkeley County father and son earlier this month, a preliminary report released by the National Transportation Safety Board stated.\n\nThe report shed light on the jet pilot\u2019s flight plan and other details leading up to the July 7 collision over Lewisfield Plantation. Additional reports and ultimately a ruling on what caused the crash are expected to follow in coming months.\n\nMike and Joe Johnson boarded a single-engine, two-seat Cessna plane with plans of spending the day in Myrtle Beach.\n\nThe bodies of both father, 68, and son, the Cessna\u2019s 30-year-old pilot, were recovered in the Cooper River.\n\nThe jet\u2019s pilot, Air Force Maj. Aaron Johnson parachuted to safety. He was said to be on a solo mission to practice instrument-assisted approaches at Charleston Air Force Base and intended to return to Shaw Air Force Base that day. He was picked up at Medway Plantation shortly after the collision.\n\nWeather conditions were favorable, with calm winds and visibility up to 10 miles the day of the crash, the preliminary report stated.\n\nThe Cessna first appeared on air traffic control radar at its take-off time, 10:57 a.m., according to the report. The private plane hadn\u2019t submitted a flight plan, according to the report, but was headed for Grand Stand Airport in North Myrtle Beach.\n\n\u201cFor the duration of its flight, the pilot of the Cessna did not contact CHS approach control, nor was he required to do so,\u201d the report stated.\n\nA traffic controller advised the jet\u2019s pilot of the Cessna\u2019s presence two miles away at 18 seconds past 11 a.m. The pilot confirmed that he was \u201clooking,\u201d the report stated.\n\nThe traffic controller and pilot spoke again 8 seconds later when the controller advised the pilot to turn if the Cessna wasn\u2019t within sight. The pilot responded asking the controller to confirm the Cessna\u2019s distance.\n\nAnother 8 seconds passed before the controller told the pilot to turn \u201cimmediately,\u201d the report stated.\n\nThe jet began a southerly turn over the next 18 seconds, the report stated, and by 52 seconds past the hour it appeared as though the Cessna was preparing to pass below the jet\u2019s 1,500-foot altitude.\n\n\u201cAt that point the targets were laterally separated by about 1,000 feet,\u201d the report said. \u201cNo further radar targets were received from the Cessna, and the next radar target for the F-16 was not received until 1101:13.\u201d\n\nA distress call from the jet\u2019s pilot came 6 seconds later. The jet continued to fly for about 3 minutes before its pilot ejected in the area of the F-16\u2019s crash site.\n\nDebris from the wreckage was scattered over an 8-mile stretch throughout rural Berkeley County.\n\nNo injuries were reported on the ground, but authorities fielded one report of damage when the jet\u2019s falling engine landed within a cluster of residential campers that sit beneath a bay of trees on McCrae Drive.\n\nThe Cessna was not carrying a black box, but the F-16 had a flight data recorder, an NTSB official reported the day after the collision. Both planes had working transponders that send traffic controllers information about position.\n\nThe Cessna\u2019s pilot also was in contact by radio with the Berkeley County Airport, where it had launched minutes before the collision, NTSB reported.\n\nMike Johnson was a former teacher, carpenter and 1969 graduate of The Citadel,\n\nJoe Johnson, a student pilot, was the registered owner of the Cessna, whose model is listed in FAA records as a 150M.\n\nHe recently had worked for Delta with the goal of flying for an airline.\n\nReach Christina Elmore at 937-5908 or at Twitter.com/celmorePC.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Preliminary report released in midair collision that killed two in Berkeley County, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Cessna 150C,F-16,Moncks Corner,NTSB,Shaw Air Force Base", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "MONCKS CORNER \u2014 Air traffic control warned the pilot of an F-16C of approaching traffic roughly a minute before the midair collision that killed a Berkeley County father and son earlier this month, a preliminary report released by the National", "title": "Preliminary report released in midair collision that killed two in Berkeley County", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150718/150719349/preliminary-report-released-in-midair-collision-that-killed-two-in-berkeley-county", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150718/PC16/150719349/AR/0/AR-150719349.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150718/PC16/150719349/AR/0/AR-150719349.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "MONCKS CORNER \u2014 Air traffic control warned the pilot of an F-16C of approaching traffic roughly a minute before the midair collision that killed a Berkeley County father and son earlier this month, a preliminary report released by the National", "title": "Preliminary report released in midair collision that killed two in Berkeley County", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150718/PC16/150719349/AR/0/AR-150719349.jpg?201507182211", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150719349}}, "keywords": "Preliminary report released in midair collision that killed two in Berkeley County , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Cessna 150C,F-16,Moncks Corner,NTSB,Shaw Air Force Base", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-18T16:14:06Z", "modified_time": "2015-07-18T22:11:00Z", "author": "Christina Elmore"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "MONCKS CORNER \u2014 Air traffic control warned the pilot of an F-16C of approaching traffic roughly a minute before the midair collision that killed a Berkeley County father and son earlier this month, a preliminary report released by the National"}, "article_summary": "(Brad Nettles/staff)MONCKS CORNER \u2014 Air traffic control warned the pilot of an F-16C of approaching traffic roughly a minute before the midair collision that killed a Berkeley County father and son earlier this month, a preliminary report released by the National Transportation Safety Board stated.\nA traffic controller advised the jet\u2019s pilot of the Cessna\u2019s presence two miles away at 18 seconds past 11 a.m.\nThe Cessna first appeared on air traffic control radar at its take-off time, 10:57 a.m., according to the report.\nThe jet\u2019s pilot, Air Force Maj.
