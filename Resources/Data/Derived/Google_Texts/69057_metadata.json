The demand for smaller homes is further compounded by older couples looking to downsize, pushing prices up even more.\n\nAccording to Rightmove, the number of online enquiries per property for homes with two or fewer bedrooms is a quarter higher than for those with three or more bedrooms. Enquiries for all homes were up 22 per cent in June compared with 2014.\n\nThe online agent said the serious shortage of suitable properties for first-time buyers highlighted \u2018the need for an urgent and marked increase in the overall housing stock\u2019 amid fears that prospective homeowners were hitting \u2018their affordability ceilings\u2019.\n\nMiles Shipside, of Rightmove, said: \u2018The greatest mismatch between demand and supply is at the lower end of the property ladder.\n\n\u2018No doubt many buyers in this category would like to afford to buy a larger home, but have had to accept that it is out of their reach and downsize their aspirations to increase their chances of a successful purchase.\n\n\u2018The challenge for government, planners and developers is how best to ensure the right properties are built in the right locations and at more affordable prices.\u2019\n\nThe website, which advertises properties for 90 per cent of UK estate agents, said enquiries for all homes were up 22 per cent in June compared to a year earlier.\n\nIn short supply: The supply and demand for two-bedroom properties has widened, a new report found\n\nBy contrast, the number of properties coming to market was 11 per cent lower than the same period in 2014.\n\nWhile many Britons are forced to wait longer to buy their first home, many existing homeowners are preparing for the first hike in their mortgage rates in eight years.\n\nThe Bank of England has warned interest rates could rise within months from its historic low of 0.5 per cent.\n\nThe Bank has not raised the base rate since July 2007, and cut it to its current level in March 2009, but governor Mark Carney, has now told families to prepare for rates to rise as soon as \u2018the turn of this year\u2019.\n\nFigures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders reveal 1.8million homeowners have never experienced a rate rise because they took out their first mortgage after 2007.\n\nMark Harris, of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: \u2018With interest rates at a rock bottom 0.5 per cent for several years, there will be many first-time homeowners who will simply never have known a rate rise.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Buying,home,harder,gap,supply,demand,two,bedroom,properties,widens", "original-source":
