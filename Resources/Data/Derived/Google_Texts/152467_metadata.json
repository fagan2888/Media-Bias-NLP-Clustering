President Obama proposed a 30-year extension of that agreement in April, which the American nuclear industry says will allow it to continue working in the country.\n\n\n\nCongress has the right to block or modify that agreement, and concerns about nuclear nonproliferation could hinder it at some point. But key lawmakers on both sides of the aisle say they support the idea of a nuclear cooperation pact, and industry officials are hopeful the new version takes hold this year.\n\n\u201cEven where the Russians may have brought in financing, or the Koreans may have underbid folks, there is still the desire to have the American supply chain come in,\u201d said David Blee, the executive director of the U.S. Nuclear Infrastructure Council, a business group.\n\n\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe United States\u2019 agreement with China has been on the books for 30 years, but Congress initially blocked the deal over nonproliferation concerns. Lawmakers let the agreement take effect in 1998.Since then, U.S. companies have looked to play a bigger role in China\u2019s growing nuclear industry. Right now, China only gets about 2 percent of its electricity from nuclear. But the country is building 24 new reactors \u2014 more than 35 percent of the reactors under construction in the world today \u2014 and the industry expects even more to come soon.Westinghouse Electric Co. signed an agreement in 2007 to export its rector technology to the country, and the company currently has four units under construction there today.\u201cThis [agreement] is really important for the U.S., to be able to keep the promises made to it by China about how they would use the technology and how the program would work,\u201d Westinghouse CEO Daniel Roderick said at an event hosted by The Hill and sponsored by the Nuclear Energy Institute last week. \u201cIt\u2019s something that is very important to U.S. business, to stay [accessible] to that market.\u201dGeopolitical issues could cause Obama\u2019s proposed agreement some problems in Congress. Members are likely to scrutinize the plan\u2019s nuclear nonproliferation protections to make sure they\u2019re strong enough to block future nuclear weapon development in Asia.The Obama administration, looking to head off those concerns, gave Congress documentation highlighting the agreement\u2019s nonproliferation components, and officials have testified on Capitol Hill about what they say are beefed-up rules.\u201cImplementing this agreement will better position the United States to continue influence the Chinese government in a positive direction on nonproliferation objectives,\u201d Thomas Countryman, the assistant secretary of the State Department\u2019s Bureau Of International Security And Nonproliferation, said at a May hearing.Both Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman(R-Tenn.) and ranking Democrat Sen.(D-Md.) have said they're concerned about China\u2019s nonproliferation policies, which could be addressed in the nuclear agreement.\u201cIt will now be up to Congress to determine if the concerns about the agreement are outweighed by the benefits,\u201d Corker said in May. \u201cIf so, we should approve the agreement without delay. If not, but the concerns can be mitigated, we should work diligently to find grounds upon which we can support the agreement. If the concerns cannot be alleviated, we should disapprove the agreement.\u201dStill, both senators have endorsed the idea of a nuclear cooperation agreement.Cardin said it gives the U.S. the chance to enforce nonproliferation policies, help countries reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and increase American business overseas.\u201cThe enormous growth in Chinese nuclear power generation represents a major opportunity for U.S. businesses, and one they have already taken advantage of,\u201d he said.The nuclear industry was emboldened by Obama\u2019s proposed agreement in April. If Congress steps in and changes it, Blee said, that would require another round of negotiations between the U.S. and China, which he said would be a \u201cshowstopper.\u201d\u201cWe are hopeful, and ultimately optimistic, that the Congress will see the merits of approving the [agreement] as proposed,\u201d Blee added.\n\nThis article is part of America's Nuclear Energy Future series, sponsored by the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI).
