The acoustic concert will feature original songs by Jonas, including music from his latest CD, \u201cBuild It Back Again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to help (the audience) connect with something greater than their individual selves \u2026 through the joy of song,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to inspire them to pursue their own creativity \u2014 and have fun.\u201d\n\nBonnie Rose, senior minister at the center, recognized Jonas\u2019 talent when she first heard a recording of his song, \u201cGod Is In.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis lyrics can make you laugh, cry, think and fall in love with the absurdities of living,\u201d said Rose, of Santa Paula. \u201cI don\u2019t know of any other songwriter with that kind of gift.\u201d\n\nAlthough it\u2019s a fundraiser, \u201cI think the immediate power of this event will be held in the sense of community it will bring forth,\u201d Rose continued. \u201cI like to imagine that many lives will be changed in small, subtle ways \u2014 ways that ultimately help make the world a better place.\u201d\n\nHis performance is a great fit for the center, she added.\n\n\u201cWe call ourselves a fun place for serious spiritual growth,\u201d Rose said. \u201cI am excited about the sense of community this event will bring \u2014 not to mention, it will be fun.\u201d\n\nConcert proceeds will help the center continue to provide services and events. Performances to Grow On, based in Ojai, was picked as the second beneficiary because of its focus on youths and its involvement in the Ojai Storytelling Festival.\n\n\u201cPerformances to Grow On helps us get in touch with what is magical in life,\u201d Rose said. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect fit for us because we believe that God is not limited to church but can be appreciated in all kinds of wholesome, heart-expanding activities.\u201d\n\nThe Ojai nonprofit presents performances from various artistic and cultural traditions that are educational, imaginative and engaging, said founder Brian Bemel.\n\n\u201cWe have a very large educational component for arts education, and the funds will be used to bring students from low-income schools to the storytelling festival,\u201d said Bemel, of Ojai. \u201cWe believe that the arts are a powerful tool to bring people from diverse backgrounds together in community.\u201d\n\nJonas believes music can happen anywhere, anytime, with anyone and anything.\n\n\u201cRecyclable and homemade instruments are a fun and integral part of making my music accessible and inspiring,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the initial spectacle of the instruments becomes overshadowed by the energy, feelings and glorious sound generated by interaction with the audience.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"title": "Billy Jonas brings his unique instruments to Ventura", "og": {"url": "http://www.vcstar.com/entertainment/arts/billy-jonas-brings-his-unique-instruments-to-ventura-ep-1046567966-345933682.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/jonas1_17111250_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 432}, "type": "article", "description": "The musician performs Saturday in Ventura", "title": "Billy Jonas brings his unique instruments to Ventura"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/jonas1_17111250_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "The musician performs Saturday in Ventura", "site": "https://twitter.com/vcstar", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Billy Jonas brings his unique instruments to Ventura"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-vcs-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd39c4\"", "article_summary": "Billy Jonas The musician will perform at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at the Ventura Center for Spiritual Living, 101 S.
