People are people. We all have the same concerns.\u201d\n\nThe self-professed \u201cprince of light and hope\u201d \u2014 a title he now says was hyperbolic \u2014 is preparing for a turn of ugly in the notoriously trying Palmetto State, even as he casts his eye toward the general election. Equal parts self-help guru and policy wonk, Kasich\u2019s optimistic message has always been an awkward sell in a party that has gravitated to the \u201cdarkness\u201d of attack ads and xenophobia, as Kasich describes it. But he is billing his strong finish in the Granite State as a vindication that another type of politics may be having a moment. \u201cI am not going to run for President by having a negative message,\u201d Kasich said as he began his remarks to an overflow crowd of several hundred at a pizza joint outside Charleston.\n\nBut first he has to ramp up his organization and appeal in the state where he polls in the single digits. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me, so I guess I\u2019ve got to go back to the beginning,\u201d Kasich said at the top of the town hall, acknowledging how far he has to go in the state. Yet there were some signs of movement, as passersby greeted him as he ate lunch at a Wendy\u2019s and when he walked to and from his campaign bus. He said an event in Hilton Head Thursday morning drew just 50 RSVPs Tuesday; now there are over 1,000 pledged attendees.\n\nKasich knows he can\u2019t win in South Carolina, but hopes to compete with his Establishment lane, Floridians Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, enough to keep them from amalgamating their lane. Already the knives are out against him. Bush has criticized Kasich for his expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act and his support for military budgeting reforms. Kasich warned rivals he would not be passive in the face of criticism, saying his McKees Rocks, Pa., roots have taught him to be scrappy: \u201cI\u2019m not going to be a pincushion or a marshmallow,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to defend myself, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nDuring his final events in New Hampshire, Kasich was frequently stopped by lifelong Democratic voters who said his message was resonating with them. Another such voter questioned him during his first appearance in South Carolina, an effect Kasich wrote off to the Democratic Party shifting leftward, particularly with the rise of Bernie Sanders. \u201cI will have a chance to win those blue collar conservative Democrats,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cTheir party has left them behind.\u201d\n\nKasich elaborated on the theme in an interview with TIME, saying his appeal to centrists makes him more electable. \u201cEveryone talks about the Republican Party moving right, that\u2019s a joke compared to how far left the Democratic Party moved,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re spending their time trying to get their socialist credentials. It\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d\n\nHis answer betrayed his own frustration with elements of his party, who have enforced purity above all else. \u201cSome people try to call me a liberal because I think we should offer opportunity to everybody, not just to some people, but to everybody,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know how the Republican Party got so far off kilter.\u201d\n\nAsked about his support of Medicaid expansion, Kasich argued his record on budgets and taxes made him the most conservative in the race. \u201cWho\u2019s more conservative than I am?\u201d he asked, before listing his achievements. \u201cI think that\u2019s the definition of conservatism. And if conservatism has switched from a philosophy of opportunity for all, then we better take a good look at what it means to be a conservative. And look, I\u2019m helping to redefine it right now.\u201d\n\nLater he told TIME that it was others who were looking to change the GOP\u2019s guiding philosophy. \u201cI think they\u2019re trying to redefine it,\u201d before admiring of himself with a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s a great line,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "It's a whole new ballgame in the South", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "It's a whole new ballgame in the South", "title": "John Kasich Looks to Retool 'Light and Hope' for South Carolina", "url": "http://time.com/4216897/john-kasich-south-carolina-republican/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/timepol-john-kasich-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/timepol-john-kasich-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "title": "John Kasich Looks to Retool 'Light and Hope' for South Carolina", "description": "It's a whole new ballgame in the South", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TIME"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "jeb bush, john kasich, new hampshire, republican, south carolina", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time", "author": "https://facebook.com/zekejmiller"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "john kasich, republican, south carolina, jeb bush, marco rubio"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThey warned me when I was coming down here, \u2018You\u2019re going to South Carolina and they\u2019re really conservative down there,\u2019\u201d Kasich said.\n+ READ ARTICLEFresh from a second-place finish in New Hampshire, Ohio Governor John Kasich knows he faces an uphill battle for success in South Carolina, a conservative electorate he has spent little time courting.\nKasich knows he can\u2019t win in South Carolina, but hopes to compete with his Establishment lane, Floridians Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, enough to keep them from amalgamating their lane.\nAnother such voter questioned him during his first appearance in South Carolina, an effect Kasich wrote off to the Democratic Party shifting leftward, particularly with the rise of Bernie Sanders.\n\u201cI will have a chance to win those blue collar conservative Democrats,\u201d Kasich said."}
