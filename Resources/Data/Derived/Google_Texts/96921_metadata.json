Repeal or delay and do nothing.\n\nWatch here:\n\nUnfortunately your browser does not support IFrames.\n\nPeggy Noonan said on This Week, \u201cI think the Obamacare problem is two-tier. One is the real problem with the website that has been fascinating and captivating people for two months. Beyond that, there is the deeper problem of America discovering of what is in the program itself, people losing coverage, the doctor situation \u2014 you can\u2019t keep them, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.\u201d\n\nOh, yes, suddenly losing coverage is a bad thing that the GOP cares about! Hop on this bus before it takes off and rolls right over you \u2014 and it will. And I guess it shouldn\u2019t be a shock that the only people the GOP cares about are those who already had insurance and now might have to switch their doctors. Oh, the inhumanity\u2026 It\u2019s truly pulling at the 47%\u2019s heartstrings. To think a few 5% of the population might have to meet a new doctor \u2014 it\u2019s almost like dying from lack of health insurance.\n\n\u201cEt cetera.\u201d This means that there is so much to complain about but Noonan figures you already know what\u2019s wrong with Obamacare. \u201cEt cetera.\u201d\n\nOn top of \u201cet cetera\u201d, there\u2019s this thing that hasn\u2019t happened yet but might! Hang on to your outrage, America \u2014 \u201cPlus, there\u2019s something new, orphaned policies, in which people go on to the site, think they have registered and find out in January that they haven\u2019t.\u201d\n\nBecause of all of that, you might as well not give health insurance to any of the 47 million who don\u2019t have it for a year. Let them die because they might not get insurance in January, \u201cSo it\u2019s so problematic that I have said since October, this thing should just be delayed one year.\u201d\n\nStephanopoulos replied, \u201cAnd Peggy Noonan, one of the things you do see, even more Republican governs signing up accepting the program especially on Medicaid. We just saw Michigan signing up on top of Ohio and New Jersey, some big states there.\u201d\n\nNoonan goes in for the anti government push, but gets hung up on government programs that she apparently loves more than ObamaCare, \u201cBut let me say something so old-fashioned, I always thought one of the central mistakes here was obsessing on the issue of insurance and not obsessing on the issue of health care and making sure everybody who gets into an accident, who has some trouble, who doesn\u2019t have money, can get treated in America.\u201d\n\nSay what? So, Peggy wants people to get treatment without insurance \u2013 no matter if they have money or not. Great idea!\n\nPeggy wants programs like Medicare to be expanded, it seems, \u201cIt seems to me, we had some programs that could be deepened, broadened, made good, made better.\u201d Yes, but ObamaCare is trying to do that and Republicans are refusing to take the money in some states. Why is that if Republicans really want the poor and middle class to get medical help?\n\nPeggy feels that since insurance and a website are so complicated, we might as well give up, \u201cAnd insurance is complicated. And we are seeing in this whole website thing and in everything that follows, you can\u2019t control that market. It\u2019s a big, complicated, nutty, messy market. We shouldn\u2019t have government even have gone in there.\u201d\n\nYet she wants to expand \u201csome programs\u201d \u2014 and those \u201cprograms\u201d are government programs.\n\nPeggy is clearly saying insurance is for the birds and the market place is \u201cnutty, messy\u201d \u2014 do tell, Ms Noonan. So we should go with expanding government programs, only the government should stay out of it.\n\nSo there you have GOP No Care \u2014 single payer, but without the government. Laugh here if you must.\n\nOr, as it was before, GOP Go Die with your corporate insurance death panels but with the sentiment of single payer \u2014 because Peggy thinks it would be super nice if people could get help without insurance.\n\nIf only doctors and hospitals would donate their time and resources or charge those with insurance to cover those without \u2013 oh, wait, that\u2019s what we were doing before ObamaCare and that wasn\u2019t fair to those with insurance and plus there was that little issue of people dying due to lack of insurance. HUH.\n\nThe market doesn\u2019t work according to Noonan and the government should stay out of government programs that work so well\u2026 But we should delay ObamaCare\u2026\n\nIn other words, Noonan is advocating for doing nothing, which is what Republicans do best when they\u2019re not obstructing and destroying.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Peggy Noonan made the argument for single payer but without the government and then landed back at the GOP's real plan: Do nothing.
