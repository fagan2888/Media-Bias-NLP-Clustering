The answer may seem intuitively simple, yet many corporations are only starting to see their employees\u2019 health and wellness as an opportunity for increasing efficiency, saving money, and not least of all, building employee loyalty.\n\nIn an interview at Davos this year AETNA CEO Mark Bertolini credited AETNA\u2019s employee wellness program with a 7.5% reduction in annual health care costs and an average increase of 69 minutes of work per month per participating employee. According to a study by ADP, a majority of mid-sized and large companies report that their wellness programs, \u201cmet or exceeded expectations in regards to reducing overall healthcare costs.\u201d Based on estimates from ABI Research, 13 million wearable activity-tracking devices such as Fitbit will be integrated into employee wellness programs by 2018.\n\n\u201cCompany wellness programs are one of our favorite sustainability success stories, which is why we developed our Wellness Retreat.\u201d says Corey Klemmer, J.D., CEO of Metamorphosis Corporate Sustainability Retreats. \u201cOur clients support sustainable, healthy lifestyles for their employees and can reap the rewards on countless fronts, from productivity and health care costs to talent acquisition and retention.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Healthcare Act, also known as Obamacare, has in many cases, resulted in increased insurance costs for employees. In order to reduce costs, companies are looking for fresh health and wellness solutions that deliver long-term benefits.\n\n\u201cWellness Retreats don\u2019t just support the bottom line,\u201d says Ken Remsen, M.D., President of Metamorphosis Corporate Sustainability Retreats, \u201cthey also demonstrate to employees that their employer has a stake in their person well being. What better way to cultivate employee loyalty then to show you care? It's a win-win. We even provide each with a fitness tracker to monitor their progress on the retreat and stay motivated when they get back, for sustained benefits to both the company and the employee.\u201d\n\nWhether providing retreats for executives, employees, incentive travel or teams within company departments, Metamorphosis Retreats aspires to add to the bottom line while providing services that build personal, communal, and environmental sustainability.\n\nAbout Metamorphosis Corporate Sustainability Retreats\n\nMetamorphosis Corporate Sustainability Retreats (Metamorphosis Retreats) was formed in 2013 to offer sustainable corporate travel opportunities ranging from health and wellness incentive trips to executive corporate social responsibility educational retreats.
