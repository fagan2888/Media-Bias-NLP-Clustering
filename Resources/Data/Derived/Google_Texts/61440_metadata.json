(AIS) have found that Anthem, Inc. was the country\u2019s top Medicaid insurer as of first quarter 2015. With nearly 4.8 million lives representing 10.27% of the national market, Anthem edges out UnitedHealthcare, which had 4.47 million enrollees and 9.59% market share as of early 2015. Centene Corporation, Molina Healthcare, Inc. and WellCare Health Plans, Inc. round out the top five. Complete findings will be published in the forthcoming AIS's Medicare and Medicaid Market Data: 2015, shipping later this month.\n\nHealth Net, Inc.\u2019s California Medicaid plan had the highest enrollment of any Medicaid plan in the United States, with 1.63 million, according to AIS researchers; its closest competitor is also a California plan, L.A. Care, which had 1.61 million enrollees as of the first quarter of 2015. California \u2014 the most populous state \u2014 has the most Medicaid enrollees at 10.2 million. This represents an increase of 52% from the end of 2013, reflecting the state\u2019s managed Medicaid expansion efforts.\n\nResearchers also found that Medicaid enrollment in the U.S. as of the first quarter of 2015 grew by almost 11 million from the fourth quarter of 2013, representing the impact of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion initiatives.
