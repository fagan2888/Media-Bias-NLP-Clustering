A suite of value-added services, Aflac Business Solutions, helps employers with compliance requirements for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and employees navigate benefits and online medical treatment.

Aflac employer clients will have access to ACA reporting compliance solutions including an ACA phone and email hotline, 1095 communications to employees and IRS filing.

The provider’s partners will offer administrative support, help negotiate employees’ unpaid medical bills and provide access to telemedicine support from health care professionals that can evaluate common conditions and ailments.

Aflac’s partnership can help employees to implement and assist with administration of a flexible spending account plan.

The intention of the suite is to help businesses keep their employees happy and productive. Teresa White, president of Aflac U.S., says the offering can be used a retention and attraction tool as plan sponsors may be limiting benefits.
