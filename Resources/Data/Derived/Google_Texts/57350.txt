The German bank halts its plans to hire 250 additional workers in Cary, North Carolina.

The stocks of companies that have women as board directors or lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and transgender employees in senior roles outperform the ones that do not, according to a recent report.

It's the new portfolio diversification, Credit Suisse, the report's publisher, is arguing.

The bank took 270 companies with openly LGBT staff as leaders or senior managers and compared their performance to a stock index tracking North America, Europe and Australia, because most of the LGBT companies Credit Suisse could identify were in one of these three regions.

"Having the policies is not enough," said Stefano Natella, Credit Suisse's global head of research, who co-wrote the report. "You have to want the culture."
