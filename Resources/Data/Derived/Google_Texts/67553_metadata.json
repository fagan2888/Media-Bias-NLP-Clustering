It almost seems too good to be true: If everyone who plays these games gets exponentially smarter, what\u2019s to stop us from becoming super-intelligent hyperbeings, walking around with brains the size of pumpkins?\n\nThen again, consider a game like Candy Crush Saga, something you might play as an alternative to a brain game. Candy Crush and its smartphone cousins are nothing more than money-grubbing timesinks, laced with garishly festive colors and chintzy sounds. Playing something like Candy Crush does little to engage anything but your dopamine receptors as you swipe mindlessly away. If you\u2019re going to waste that time anyway, why not try doing something constructive?\n\nRelated: The App-Selling Power of Kate Upton\u2019s Cleavage\n\nOf course, the science behind brain training apps is still less than solid. Though it\u2019s a very new field of study, there\u2019s no definitive proof that these apps have any long-term benefits in any kind of intelligence metric, and some critics have even gone so far to call apps like Lumosity a scam. Other studies disagree, finding that there\u2019s a small but statistically significant improvement between those who use some kind of brain-training app and those who don\u2019t.\n\nEven if these products offer no more than a placebo effect, that mindset may still matter. Making an active effort to engage yourself in times when you could be staring listlessly off into space or watching Maury can have an effect on your personal sense of well-being, if nothing else. It\u2019s like doing a morning set of push-ups, taking the stairs instead of the elevator, or resolving to eat less fast food. All of those little things can make a big difference.\n\nRelated: Video Games Could Be Coming to Vegas Casinos\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nWith that in mind, we\u2019ve put together a short list of the highest-rated brain training apps and games. Some of them address so-called \u201ccore cognitive\u201d skills, others teach you languages. Some are just fun to play. All of them make you think, at least a little bit. But we assume no responsibility if you don\u2019t win the Nobel Prize this year.\n\nClick here to see the 8 best brain-training apps\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It\u2019s very easy to be a little leery of so-called \u201cbrain training\u201d apps and games.", "title": "The 8 Best Apps to Train Your Brain", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/13/8-Best-Apps-Train-Your-Brain", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/12092012_Brain_Gears_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/13/8-Best-Apps-Train-Your-Brain", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/12092012_Brain_Gears_article.jpg", "creator": "@lumbology", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It\u2019s very easy to be a little leery of so-called \u201cbrain training\u201d apps and games.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: The App-Selling Power of Kate Upton\u2019s CleavageOf course, the science behind brain training apps is still less than solid.\nIt\u2019s very easy to be a little leery of so-called \u201cbrain training\u201d apps and games.\nRelated: Video Games Could Be Coming to Vegas Casinos\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bWith that in mind, we\u2019ve put together a short list of the highest-rated brain training apps and games.\nThen again, consider a game like Candy Crush Saga, something you might play as an alternative to a brain game.\nCandy Crush and its smartphone cousins are nothing more than money-grubbing timesinks, laced with garishly festive colors and chintzy sounds."}
