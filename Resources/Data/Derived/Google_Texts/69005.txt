The leader of the Islamic State group has ordered the terror organization to start minting gold, silver and copper coins for its own currency–the Islamic dinar. A website affiliated with the group said IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi instructed his followers to mint the coins to “change the tyrannical monetary system” modeled on Western economies that “enslaved Muslims.” The order was approved by the Islamic State group’s Shura Council, an advisory board, according to the website. The authenticity of the posting couldn’t be independently verified but the website has been used in the past for IS postings.
