LOS ANGELES (MarketWatch) -- Hospira Inc. HSP, +0.15% shares were down slightly Tuesday after the drug and device maker reportedly got another warning letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration over manufacturing deficiencies at one of its plants in Liscate, Italy. The Wall Street Journal reported this is at least the sixth warning letter issued to Hospira, and it questions whether the company is taking sufficient measures to prevent contamination and make sure records on quality-control measures are tamper-free. The Journal says it calls for Hospira to respond with a fix-it plan. FDA officials could not confirm the existence of the letter. Hospira is being purchased by Pfizer Inc. PFE, +0.73% which was up marginally to $34.77.
