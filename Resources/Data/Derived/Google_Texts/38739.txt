The drug, used to treat particular forms of leukemia and lymphoma, showed “statistically significant” improvement in survival rates for patients using Imbruvica versus another drug, Ofatumumab, Pharmacyclics /quotes/zigman/53242/delayed /quotes/nls/pcyc PCYC officials said in a press release.

Shares of the company jumped $19.14 to $124.20 in recent action.
