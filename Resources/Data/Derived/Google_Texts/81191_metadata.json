Four months ago we got a $1 raise to $9.\u201d\n\nLopez loads baggage onto conveyor belts at the Delta Air Lines ticket desk or carries oversized bags down to the unionized Delta baggage handlers at plane-loading level.\n\nDuring breaks, Lopez watches people soar 35,000 feet into the blue heavens on business trips and swanky vacations to Miami, West Palm Beach, Atlanta and all over the U.S.A. as he struggles in the underclass of New York City, deep below the poverty line with a base take-home pay of about $500 every two weeks.\n\n\u201cYaquira takes care of the baby and works at Michaels, but it\u2019s only seasonal,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes on my days off she gets a day or two as a cashier in a local supermarket. I don\u2019t like it but we get a city rent subsidy for $600 of our $1,100 rent. Plus food stamps and WIC. I hate taking subsidies. I want to support my family on my own in a union job with a living wage and benefits so I don't need subsidies.\u201d\n\nLopez loads baggage onto conveyor belts at the Delta ticket desk or carries oversized bags down to the plane-loading level at LaGuardia'a Terminal D. (AFP/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nBut Lopez claims that Aviation Safeguards has shortchanged his already meager paycheck to the tune of thousands of dollars over three years.\n\n\u201cI can't tell you how many times they paid me for less hours than I worked,\u201d he says. \u201cTo get paid for those missing hours I\u2019d have to take four trains \u2014 the 6, 4, N and F \u2014 to Kew Gardens, Queens, to the company\u2019s main office and wait hours on the long human resources line with all the other shortchanged workers.\"\n\nThen Lopez would have to fill out paperwork and prove he worked those missing hours.\n\n\u201cIf the claim is approved then you wait two or three paychecks sometimes to get the back money,\u201d he says. \u201cMy days off are Sundays, when the office is closed, and Mondays, which I love spending with my family. Most times it\u2019s not worth spending the carfare and your day off trying to get paid for time you already worked. So they get away with not paying me for those hours.\u201d\n\nLopez is one of 88% of 12,000 nonunion workers at LaGuardia, Kennedy and Newark airports claiming at least one form of \u201cwage theft\u201d in the last year in a new Local 32BJ SEIU report titled \"Grounded Before Takeoff: Pervasive Wage Abuse Amongst New York City Airports\u2019 Subcontracted Workers.\u201d\n\nLopez is faced with a long journey to Aviation Safeguards' main office in Kew Gardens, Queens, to claim the pay he is owed. (TOMAS E. GASTON)\n\n\u201cFor low-wage workers already struggling to make ends meet, the rampant wage and hour violations at the airports are a second blow,\u201d said Hector Figueroa, president of 32BJ SEIU. \u201cThese violations are not only illegal but they expose the broader malfunction of the subcontracting system at the airports.\u201d\n\nCraig Coy, CEO of Aviation Safeguards, says his company is not in collective bargaining with any union at any of the New York area airports and denies his company is involved in a pattern of wage theft.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a publicly traded company that values our workers,\u201d says Coy. \u201cWe\u2019re paying above minimum wage and signing up workers for health care that's better than the Affordable Care Act. We have a history of respecting unions that bargain honestly.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Lopez rises each work day at 2:30 a.m. to travel to LaGuardia for his 4 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. shift. \u201cLast time I took my girlfriend \u2018out\u2019 was to see the \u2018The Hunger Games,\u2019 \u201d he says, laughing at the irony. \u201cYaquira\u2019s favorite restaurant is Olive Garden but we can\u2019t even afford the $10 all-you-can-eat pasta special. But my mom works in a day care so she gave us a Cool Culture Card that gets us into museums for free.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a young guy who\u2019s doing all the right things that a responsible father is supposed to be doing. But like the 88% of 12,000 subcontracted airport workers screened by Local 32BJ of SEIU he says he\u2019s getting skyjacked.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2014457.1416293942!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/hamill18n-1-web.jpg", "description": "Gian Lopez, 21, supports his girlfriend, Yaquira Collado, 20, and their daughter, Yliaelena Lopez, 2, working as a $9-an-hour nonunion subcontracted baggage handler for Aviation Safeguards in Terminal D of LaGuardia Airport, where he\u2019s worked for three years.", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "parsely-title": "Hamill: Airport workers claim to be victims of wage ripoffs", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/hamill-airport-workers-claim-victims-wage-ripoffs-article-1.2014458", "twitter": {"description": "Gian Lopez, 21, supports his girlfriend, Yaquira Collado, 20, and their daughter, Yliaelena Lopez, 2, working as a $9-an-hour nonunion subcontracted baggage handler for Aviation Safeguards in Terminal D of LaGuardia Airport, where he\u2019s worked for three years.", "title": "Hamill: Airport workers claim to be victims of wage ripoffs", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/hamill-airport-workers-claim-victims-wage-ripoffs-article-1.2014458", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2014457.1416293942!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/hamill18n-1-web.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-18T03:33:59-0500", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "sailthru.title": "Hamill: Airport workers claim to be victims of wage ripoffs", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Gian Lopez, 21, supports his girlfriend, Yaquira Collado, 20, and their daughter, Yliaelena Lopez, 2, working as a $9-an-hour nonunion subcontracted baggage handler for Aviation Safeguards in Terminal D of LaGuardia Airport, where he\u2019s worked for three years.", "title": "Hamill: Airport workers claim to be victims of wage ripoffs", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/hamill-airport-workers-claim-victims-wage-ripoffs-article-1.2014458", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2014457.1416293942!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/hamill18n-1-web.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "nydn_section": "New York", "parsely-type": "article", "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "New York", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Gian Lopez, 21, supports his girlfriend, Yaquira Collado, 20, and their daughter, Yliaelena Lopez, 2, working as a $9-an-hour nonunion subcontracted baggage handler for Aviation Safeguards in Terminal D of LaGuardia Airport, where he\u2019s worked for three years.", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2014457.1416293942!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/hamill18n-1-web.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-11-18T08:33:59"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019re paying above minimum wage and signing up workers for health care that's better than the Affordable Care Act.\nBut like the 88% of 12,000 subcontracted airport workers screened by Local 32BJ of SEIU he says he\u2019s getting skyjacked.\n\u201cIf the claim is approved then you wait two or three paychecks sometimes to get the back money,\u201d he says.\nMost times it\u2019s not worth spending the carfare and your day off trying to get paid for time you already worked.\n\u201cSometimes on my days off she gets a day or two as a cashier in a local supermarket."}
