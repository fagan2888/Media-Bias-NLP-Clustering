She\u2019d been denied the opportunity to testify before a House panel about the need for insurance companies to cover contraception. The exclusion ticked off Democrats, who noted that only men were on hand to discuss an issue with a disproportionate impact on women. The Democrats held their own panel with Fluke and others. Republicans declined to show up.\n\nFor a day or two, Fluke thought the entire controversy would be a footnote in the Obamacare fights -- another hearing gathering dust in the C-Span archives. But then Rush Limbaugh targeted her: He went on his radio show, butchered her name, and called her a slut. The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nBut Fluke wasn\u2019t necessarily supposed to speak before the panel in the first place. If it weren't for another student\u2019s class schedule, she could still be just another unknown policy wonk today.\n\nAt that time, Fluke was part of a group of people on campus who were, as she described it, \"concerned about the lack of comprehensive reproductive health care coverage on our insurance for students.\" The group had explored a few avenues for speaking out, as well as the possibility of filing a lawsuit, but concluded that working through the Affordable Care Act was the best path forward. They held a press conference at the National Press Club, which got the attention of lawmakers.\n\nWhen the invitation came to testify, they had to decide who would go. Fluke explained to \"Candidate Confessional\" why she was chosen.\n\n\"You want the honest answer?\" she said. \"Somebody had class at that time\u2026 That was certainly part of it. I actually skipped immigration law to go and testify.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "The contraception rights advocate testified before Congress partly because another student had class.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2016-05-14 12:44:05 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "The contraception rights advocate testified before Congress partly because another student had class.", "title": "How A Classmate's Scheduling Conflict Paved The Way For Sandra Fluke", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sandra-fluke-candidate-confessional_us_5735fc94e4b060aa781a1e0d", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/5735fdcb130000f0043818a3.jpeg?cache=nhmq8hlq7z", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The contraception rights advocate testified before Congress partly because another student had class.", "title": "How A Classmate's Scheduling Conflict Paved The Way For Sandra Fluke", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/5735fdcb130000f0043818a3.jpeg?cache=nhmq8hlq7z", "height": 1000}, "creator": "@samsteinHP,@jasoncherkis", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-05-13 12:44:05 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5735fc94e4b060aa781a1e0d", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Sandra Fluke ,fluke candidate confessional,sandra fluke contraception,sandra fluke rush limbaugh", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Sandra Fluke ,fluke candidate confessional,sandra fluke contraception,sandra fluke rush limbaugh", "published_time": "2016-05-13 12:44:05 -0400", "modified_time": "2016-05-13 12:44:05 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "She\u2019d been denied the opportunity to testify before a House panel about the need for insurance companies to cover contraception.\nIn the first half of 2012, Sandra Fluke went from being an unknown student at Georgetown University Law Center to a leading advocate for contraception rights and a rising star within the Democratic Party.\nThe Democrats held their own panel with Fluke and others.\nThey held a press conference at the National Press Club, which got the attention of lawmakers.\nBut Fluke wasn\u2019t necessarily supposed to speak before the panel in the first place."}
