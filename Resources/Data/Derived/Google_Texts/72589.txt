ICYMI Health features what we're reading this week.

This week, we examined pieces that explored unconventional ways of thinking. A new book by Bren√© Brown explores why dwelling on failure can actually yield positive results, and a father-daughter team makes a case for seeking solutions to problems rather than analyzing our feelings about them.

We also took note of a highly practical survey about bicycle signage that could hold a key to improving relationships between rides and drivers.

Read on and tell us in the comments: What did you read and love this week?
