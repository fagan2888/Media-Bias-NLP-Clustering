People who are prepared to work for less than the industry rate will attract the investors.\u201d\n\nPrivate equity firms typically charge a 2% management fee on money allocated to private equity funds, as well as an additional 20% fee on profits, known as \u201ccarried interest\u201d.\n\nAs of September 2015, 72% of firms globally charged a 2% to 2.24% management fee, while 85% take 20% in carried interest, according to data provider Preqin.\n\n\u201cIn most areas of money management you only pay a fee when the money is invested,\u201d Mr. Rubenstein said. \u201cAt a private equity firm, you get a fee on committed capital.\u201d\n\nA December 2015 survey of 81 private equity professionals by specialist bank and asset management firm Investec found that nearly a fifth of private equity firms intend to lower their management fees either imminently or in the long term. Pressure from investors was cited as the main driver behind the change to fee structures.\n\n\u201cIf an investor comes along and says \u2018I will give you $5 billion but I am not going to pay a fee on committed capital and I am not going to give you 20% [carried interest]. I will give you 10% but no hurdle\u2019, what are you going to do?\u201d Mr. Rubenstein said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t take the $5 billion on those terms, they will give it to somebody else who will accept those terms.\u201d\n\nHowever, he added that \u201cdisruption is an innovator\u2019s dilemma\u201d, suggesting that not all firms would be rushing to change their fees.\n\n\u201cIf you are at the top of the heap in any industry you are reluctant to do anything to change your business model,\u201d he said.\n\nCarlyle declined to comment on whether it charges fees on invested or committed capital.\n\nWrite to William Louch at william.louch@wsj.com", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Carlyle Group co-founder David Rubenstein predicts that investor pressure will drive down private equity fees.", "title": "Carlyle\u2019s Rubenstein: PE Firms Need to Accept Lower Fees", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2016/01/20/carlyles-rubenstein-pe-firms-need-to-accept-lower-fees/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Carlyle\u2019s Rubenstein: PE Firms Need to Accept Lower Fees", "description": "Carlyle Group co-founder David Rubenstein predicts that investor pressure will drive down private equity fees.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Laura Kreutzer", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Private Equity Beat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Private Equity Beat", "article.summary": "Carlyle Group co-founder David Rubenstein predicts that investor pressure will drive down private equity fees.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2016-01-20T13:52:38-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2016/01/20/carlyles-rubenstein-pe-firms-need-to-accept-lower-fees/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-PEBB-19458", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Carlyle Group co-founder David Rubenstein predicts that investor pressure will drive down private equity fees.", "title": "Carlyle\u2019s Rubenstein: PE Firms Need to Accept Lower Fees", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2016/01/20/carlyles-rubenstein-pe-firms-need-to-accept-lower-fees/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Private Equity Beat", "article.id": "BL-PEBB-19458", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2016-01-20T13:52:38-05:00"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIn most areas of money management you only pay a fee when the money is invested,\u201d Mr. Rubenstein said.\nI will give you 10% but no hurdle\u2019, what are you going to do?\u201d Mr. Rubenstein said.\nBy William LouchDavid Rubenstein, co-founder of the Carlyle Group, predicted that private equity fees would come down in the coming years, because investors will no longer accept certain fees that buyout firms charge \u2013 a development that he said could transform \u201cthe whole industry\u201d.\nAs of September 2015, 72% of firms globally charged a 2% to 2.24% management fee, while 85% take 20% in carried interest, according to data provider Preqin.\nCarlyle declined to comment on whether it charges fees on invested or committed capital."}
