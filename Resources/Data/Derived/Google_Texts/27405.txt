Controversial or not, enrollment has kicked off for the Federal Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.

The contentious shutdown of the U.S. government, effective yesterday, failed to delay or defund the act, as a vote by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives wanted. So, Jersey City, Hudson County and the rest of the country are proceeding with their efforts to enroll many of the well over 50 million people who qualify for the program.

Urban League offices in Hudson and Bergen counties are already enrolling applicants and dispensing information on Obamacare.

As reported in The Jersey Journal earlier this week, the Jersey City Department of Health and Human Services has 10 certified counselors/navigators, and Metropolitan Family Health Network, 935 Garfield Ave., also has a team of "enrollment specialists." One of them is located at the Urban League of Hudson County office, 253 Martin Luther King Drive, Jersey City.

According to Niyona Boateng, the Urban League's project director of Affordable Care Act navigators, a number of people walked into the agency's King Drive office seeking information or wishing to enroll in the program.

Boateng said the navigators received 20 hours of training.

Anyone interested in ACA enrollment needs to bring current insurance information, if any, along with tax reruns and pay stubs.

Boateng said her office is also hoping that churches, community organizations, book clubs, etc., will assist in encouraging anyone who might qualify to enroll.

"If requested, we will make someone available to address churches and organizations about enrollment in the ACA," Boateng said.
