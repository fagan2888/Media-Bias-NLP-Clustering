Glenn Beck is really not happy about Americans enrolling in Obamacare.

The White House reached a major goal on Monday, after more than 7 million people signed up for health care under the new legislation. President Obama made celebratory remarks about the growing numbers.

Beck's response on his Wednesday radio show was a rant in which he called Obama "a full-fledged dictator" without the military uniform, and members of the media "rat bastards" for covering the president's speech. As Salon reported, the radio host also said that if Obama were to wear a uniform, it would be one he designed himself.

Yelling in his microphone, Beck proceeded to invoke the Declaration of Independence:

I’m not going to waste. My. Life. I’m going to do what I was born to do! All men were created equal and endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, among these are life, liberty AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS! I have a right to pursue my happiness! I have a right to do what I was born to do, not what they tell me what to do. That’s what that phrase means!
