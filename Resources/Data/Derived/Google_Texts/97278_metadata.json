(NYSE: MOH):\n\nNet income per diluted share, continuing operations, of $0.77 for the quarter, compared with $0.33 in 2014.\n\nAdjusted net income per diluted share, continuing operations, 1 of $0.89 for the quarter, compared with $0.48 for 2014.\n\nof $0.89 for the quarter, compared with $0.48 for 2014. Total revenue of $3.6 billion, up 45% over third quarter 2014 and 2% over second quarter 2015.\n\nMolina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE: MOH) today reported its financial results for the third quarter of 2015.\n\n\u201cMomentum in our business continues to grow as we execute on our priorities of revenue growth, profit improvement and business diversification,\u201d said J. Mario Molina M.D., chief executive officer of Molina Healthcare, Inc. \u201cI am very proud of our performance so far this year, and I look forward to welcoming the employees and patients of Providence Human Services into the Molina family.\u201d As previously announced, the Company has agreed to acquire Providence Human Services, LLC and Providence Community Services, LLC, both wholly owned subsidiaries of The Providence Service Corporation, in an all-cash transaction.\n\nOverview of Financial Results, Continuing Operations\n\nFinancial results for the third quarter of 2015 improved significantly over the same quarter of 2014 due to higher revenue, greater medical cost efficiency, and full state reimbursement of the Affordable Care Act Health Insurer Fee (HIF).\n\nIncome from continuing operations, before tax expense, increased to $98 million in the third quarter of 2015, from $24 million in the third quarter of 2014.\n\nPremium revenue increased approximately 46% in the third quarter of 2015, compared with the third quarter of 2014, due to increased Medicaid expansion, integrated Medicare-Medicaid Plan and Marketplace enrollment, growth in the Company\u2019s Illinois health plan, and the start-up of the Company\u2019s Puerto Rico health plan earlier this year.\n\nMedical care costs as a percent of premium revenue (the \u201cmedical care ratio\u201d) decreased to 89.3% in the third quarter of 2015, from 90.6% in the third quarter of 2014.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue (the \u201cgeneral and administrative expense ratio\u201d) increased to 8.0% in the third quarter of 2015, from 7.2% in the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to broker and exchange fees associated with the Company\u2019s Marketplace program.\n\nHealth Insurer Fee Update\n\nThe Company has secured full reimbursement for the Medicaid portion of its expense under the HIF. During the third quarter of 2015, the Company recognized as revenue certain amounts of HIF reimbursement due from Michigan and Utah for prior periods. These amounts represented approximately $8 million ($0.08 per diluted share) of HIF revenue related to 2014 and approximately $17 million ($0.18 per diluted share) related to the first two quarters of 2015.\n\nThe amount of HIF reimbursement not recognized in the third quarter of 2014 was approximately $6 million ($0.07 per diluted share) and approximately $37 million ($0.49 per diluted share) for the nine months ended September 30, 2014.\n\nTexas Health Plan Quality Revenue Update\n\nAs previously disclosed, the Company has deferred recognition of that portion of its quality related revenue in Texas that is based upon measures for which the Company does not have historical information, clear definitions, and clarity around minimum standards. Such revenue is estimated to be approximately $20 million for all of 2014 and $17 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company has not recognized any of this revenue through September 30, 2015.\n\nConference Call\n\nThe Company\u2019s management will host a conference call and webcast to discuss its third quarter results at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on Thursday, October 29, 2015.

Adjusted net income per diluted share, continuing operations, is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management as a supplemental metric in evaluating its financial performance, its financing and business decisions, and in forecasting and planning for future periods. This measure is not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and should not be viewed as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is diluted net income per share, continuing operations.

These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as supplements to, and not as substitutes for or superior to, GAAP measures.\n\nThe first of these non-GAAP measures is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).
