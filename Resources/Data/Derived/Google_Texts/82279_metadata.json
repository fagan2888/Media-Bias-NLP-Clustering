John Hickenlooper on Sunday announced a 640-acre land transfer to expand the historical preservation of the deadly site.\n\n\u201cFar too many people have never heard this story,\u201d Hickenlooper said. \u201cI encourage all Coloradans to make the story of Sand Creek a living history sharing the truth about this tragedy with others, especially our children, to instill empathy and understanding, the realization of what cruelty people are capable of. This deepens our resolve to prevent the worst of human nature from manifesting in the perpetuation of violence and injustice against others.\u201d\n\nThe 640 acres being expanded are adjacent to the current historic site outside of Eads where about 200 people \u2014 mostly women, children and the elderly \u2014 were killed when U.S. Army soldiers ambushed the camp of Cheyenne and Arapaho chiefs as they slept.\n\nAlexa Roberts, superintendent of the Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site for the National Park Service, said the land marks the spot where soldiers prepared to attack the camp.\n\nSunday, tribal chiefs and leaders of the Cheyenne and Arapaho communities gathered at the state Capitol for the 17th annual Spiritual Run and Remembrance event commemorating the massacre.\n\nChief Navitt Spotted Elk choked back tears at the event as he remembered his grandfather, Charles, an infant survivor of the massacre who became an orphan that day.\n\n\u201cWhen I was running, I was thinking of them,\u201d Spotted Elk said. \u201cFrom that baby that survived is where I came from.\u201d\n\nHickenlooper also announced that Strasburg High School has chosen to collaborate with tribal leaders to change its American Indian mascot. The school will begin to incorporate the history of the massacre into its curriculum.\n\nThe governor added that half of the necessary funds have been raised for a Sand Creek memorial at the state Capitol.\n\nDennis Gallagher, former Denver auditor and annual participant in the anniversary events, said he hopes the increased efforts to preserve history will let people learn from the past.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope next year when we meet,\u201d Gallagher said to the crowd, \u201cthe world has learned a little something about not massacring each other.\u201d\n\nYesenia Robles: 303-954-1372, yrobles@denverpost.com or @yeseniarobles", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Hickenlooper approves 640-acre land transfer to preserve Sand Creek history on anniversary", "title": "Hickenlooper approves 640-acre land transfer to preserve Sand Creek history on anniversary", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/29/hickenlooper-approves-640-acre-land-transfer-to-preserve-sand-creek-history-on-anniversary/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151129__20151130_A2_CD30MASSACREp2.jpg", "height": 454}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151129__20151130_A2_CD30MASSACREp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-29T20:12:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T07:06:31+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Marking the 151st anniversary of the Sand Creek Massacre, Gov.\nThe governor added that half of the necessary funds have been raised for a Sand Creek memorial at the state Capitol.\nJohn Hickenlooper on Sunday announced a 640-acre land transfer to expand the historical preservation of the deadly site.\nAlexa Roberts, superintendent of the Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site for the National Park Service, said the land marks the spot where soldiers prepared to attack the camp.\nDennis Gallagher, former Denver auditor and annual participant in the anniversary events, said he hopes the increased efforts to preserve history will let people learn from the past."}
