Furthermore, four to six months after graduation, 89 percent of new bachelor's degree graduates had secured employment in nursing.\n\nRegistered nurses who graduate from entry-level master's programs also had luck landing jobs after graduation. The survey found 67 percent secured a position at graduation and 90 percent found employment four to six months after graduation.\n\nMore hospitals are requiring new hires have a bachelor's degree in nursing (43.7 percent compared to 39.1 percent in 2012) and 78.6 percent of healthcare employers now express a strong preference for BSN program graduates, according to the survey.\n\n\"Clearly, healthcare settings nationwide are seeing a difference in nursing practice based on the level of education and are making hiring decisions to enhance the quality of care available to patients,\" AACN President Jane Kirschling in the survey announcement. \"With a significant number of nurses nearing retirement, we fully expect to see the demand for baccalaureate-prepared nurses continue to rise into the foreseeable future.\"\n\nThe call for nurses to earn advanced degrees comes in the wake of recommendations from the Institute of Medicine that 80 percent of all nurses hold bachelor's degrees by 2020 as part of a nationwide movement to improve patient care.\n\nBut the extra cost and additional course load after a long day at work is also a hardship for those nurses with two-year associate's degrees, many of whom have worked in the healthcare industry for years, according to an article on NJ.com.\n\nSaint Peter's University Hospital in New Brunswick, N.J., set a policy last year that all registered nurses must earn a bachelor's degree within the next decade, NJ.com reported. The new policy means nearly half of the registered nurses at the hospital must go back to school in order to keep their jobs.\n\nIn response, more than a dozen colleges and universities are offering special accelerated programs and online courses to help the registered nurses quickly upgrade their diplomas. Some colleges are even sending professors to hospitals to help nurses take classes between shifts, according to the article. Fortunately, for the nurses at St. Peter's, the hospital is picking up most of the cost for the courses.\n\nAlthough studies that show patients receive better care in hospitals that employ nurses with higher-level academic degrees, many of the nurses interviewed for the N.J.com article weren't sure the extra schooling would make them better nurses. Most of the courses, they said, focus on research and theory--not practical day-to-day nursing techniques.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the survey report\n\n- read the announcement\n\n- check out the NJ.com article\n\n- read the IOM recommendations\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nAs market worsens for hospital jobs, nurses look elsewhere\n\nFewer patient deaths linked to more four-year nursing degrees\n\nInternationally educated nurses could help meet healthcare demand\n\nScope of palliative care widens amid workforce shortage\n\nMore men enter nursing--and earn higher salaries than women\n\nHow healthcare reform affects nurses\n\nReport: NPs, Pas won't solve primary care shortage", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite\u00a0a recent report that there are fewer jobs for nurses in hospitals, the\u00a0American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) has\u00a0good news for students graduating this May from entry-level baccalaureate (BSN) and master's nursing programs: New\u00a0data\u00a0shows they are much more likely to receive a job offer upon graduat", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Despite\u00a0a recent report that there are fewer jobs for nurses in hospitals, the\u00a0American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) has\u00a0good news for students graduating this May from entry-level baccalaureate (BSN) and master's nursing programs: New\u00a0data\u00a0shows they are much more likely to receive a job offer upon graduat", "title": "Nurses with advanced degrees more likely to land jobs after graduation", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/nurses-bsn-and-masters-degrees-more-likely-land-jobs-after-graduation/2013-12-05", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "advanced degrees,American Association of Colleges of Nurses,HR & Workforce Management,Institute Of Medicine IOM,nursing students,Patient Care & Outcomes,registered nurses", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "HR & Workforce Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe022d\"", "article_summary": "The call for nurses to earn advanced degrees comes in the wake of recommendations from the Institute of Medicine that 80 percent of all nurses hold bachelor's degrees by 2020 as part of a nationwide movement to improve patient care.\nRegistered nurses who graduate from entry-level master's programs also had luck landing jobs after graduation.\nThe survey found 67 percent secured a position at graduation and 90 percent found employment four to six months after graduation.\nFurthermore, four to six months after graduation, 89 percent of new bachelor's degree graduates had secured employment in nursing.\nThe new policy means nearly half of the registered nurses at the hospital must go back to school in order to keep their jobs."}
