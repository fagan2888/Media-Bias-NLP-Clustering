Metropolitan State University of Denver is in discussions with Denver Health about partnering to run its campus health center and to participate in health-related academic programs, officials said.

“Though nothing has been determined at this point, given the sea change that the Affordable Care Act has brought about in health care and insurance, we are committed to examining whether running a campus health care center ourselves makes sense,” said Metro State spokeswoman Cathy Lucas.

She said running a health care center is not a core competency of the university, which already contracts with outside physicians to provide services at the Health Center at Auraria.

She did not comment on whether closing the medical center might be one of the options being considered.

Denver Health did not respond to a request for comment.
