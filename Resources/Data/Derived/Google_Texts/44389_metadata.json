To hear Fournier tell it, he is above partisanship, political gamesmanship, and small ball. Integrity is Fournier\u2019s currency, and blasting shallow, partisan hypocrites is his brand.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nWhat to make, then, of Fournier\u2019s glaring, highly-partisan hypocrisy and dishonesty in his latest moral crusade \u2014 this one to use former-New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani as a club against the entire Republican Party?\n\nFor two days now, all over Twitter and cable television, Fournier has posed as a Man of Principle outraged over the fact that, in a private setting, Giuliani dared question the love President Obama has for his country (to his credit, Giuliani is now publicly standing by his claim).\n\nThis is just a sample of Fournier\u2019s outrage campaign:\n\n\u2014\n\nWhen opposing somebody\u2019s views spills into questioning their patriotism, you\u2019ve sacrificed your seriousness, Mr Mayor http://t.co/c2uMDPS1iL \u2014 Ron Fournier (@ron_fournier) February 19, 2015\n\n\u2014\n\nFournier is furious that Giuliani criticized The World\u2019s Most Powerful Man, and he obviously believes that you \u201csacrifice your seriousness\u201d when \u201copposing somebody\u2019s views spills into questioning their patriotism.\u201d And yet\u2026\n\n\u2026at the 3:15 mark in the video below (from late 2013) you will see Fournier himself openly question the patriotism of others.\n\nWorse, unlike Giuliani, Fournier isn\u2019t questioning the patriotism of The World\u2019s Most Powerful Man, a man with legions of political and media supporters to rush to his defense. No, Fournier questions the patriotism of ObamaCare opponents.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\nFOURNIER: And I would say not \u201calmost\u201d rooting for failure. There are many Republicans rooting for failure and I frankly find that unpatriotic. The law\u2019s been passed. We should all be doing what we can to make it work.\n\nFournier has also called the questioning of Obama\u2019s patriotism \u201cpathetic and beneath\u201d Giuliani.\n\nApparently, it\u2019s not pathetic and beneath Fournier to do the same to millions.\n\nApparently, rules are for Little People, like former mayors. It gets better\u2026\n\nBecause a raging ego, and a mercenary impulse to tailor your beliefs to whatever cable network you happen to be on, oftentimes blinds self-awareness, here\u2019s video from just yesterday of Fournier on his high horse (if you\u2019ll pardon the expression) blasting those who question the patriotism of others as \u2026 \u201cunpatriotic.\u201d\n\nCaptain Integrity\u2019s principles on this issue are now pretty clear. There is a pattern. According to Fournier, fighting against The State (ObamaCare) and criticizing The Leader of the State (Obama) are the only true acts that reach the level of unpatriotic.\n\nBeyond the \u201cunpatriotic\u201d hypocrisy, Fournier\u2019s chilling belief that we must all get in line to make a law like ObamaCare work is almost beyond comprehension. To paraphrase \u201cThe Princess Bride,\u201d I\u2019m not sure the word patriotism means what Ron Fournier thinks it means.\n\nSomething else that doesn\u2019t mean what Fournier think it means is \u201cnon-partisan.\u201d Here\u2019s Fournier going the full-Todd Akin \u2014 weaponizing the opinion of a single man against the Republican Party as a whole:\n\n\u2014\n\nHoping that @ScottWalker and @Reince have the decency to denounce this along with rest of GOP: http://t.co/c2uMDPS1iL \u2014 Ron Fournier (@ron_fournier) February 19, 2015\n\n\u2014\n\nThis is something the objective, unbiased, not-at-all liberal media only does to the GOP. The media is really nothing more than a bunch of left-wing \u201cgotcha\u201d trackers, and when they snag one \u2014 whether it\u2019s a \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d star or a former mayor \u2014 all Republicans must always answer for whatever personal opinion the media wants stamped out.\n\nThis is Thought Policing 101, but it also a very effective partisan weapon the media wields against the GOP at every opportunity. For instance\u2026\n\nGiuliani is a former mayor who expressed his opinion in what he thought was a private setting. Joe Biden is a sitting Vice President who just this week publicly stereotyped Somalis. No one in the media, including Captain Integrity, is asking any Democrat to distance themselves from Biden\u2019s latest racist statement. No one in the media grilled a single Democrat over DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz\u2019s criticism of intermarriage. And in 2008, when then-candidate Obama questioned a sitting president\u2019s patriotism, no one in the media\u2026. Well, you get my point.\n\nIn fact, all three of those stories \u2014 involving a candidate for president, the head of the DNC, and a sitting Vice President \u2014 got about 5% the media attention the private comments of a former mayor did.\n\nWhen questioned on this double standard, America\u2019s Moral Courage Crusader punted (if you\u2019ll pardon the expression):\n\n\u2014\n\n.@Thomasismyuncle @TheRickWilson That\u2019s not the problem.
