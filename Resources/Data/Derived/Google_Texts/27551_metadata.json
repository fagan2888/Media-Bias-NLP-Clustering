He plans to be operating from the 8,700-square-foot-building on 2670 Airport-Pulling Road South on December 15. (Dania Maxwell/Staff)\n\nBy John Osborne\n\nIt has been a labor of love since the beginning for Sam Saad III and his family.\n\nLiterally, at times.\n\nWhen Saad, 37 \u2014 a real estate and business attorney, Naples city councilman and father of two \u2014 moves his base of operations to a recently purchased, 8,700-square-foot building at 2670 Airport-Pulling Road S. on Dec. 15, he could be forgiven for flashing back to the fateful day in 2007, when he was scheduled to open his current office at the corner of Fifth Avenue South and U.S. 41 in downtown Naples.\n\nA fateful day that didn\u2019t unfold as planned because the stork had other scheduling ideas in mind.\n\nAfter moving to Southwest Florida from Washington, D.C., in 2003, where he worked on the re-election campaign of President George W. Bush, Saad and his wife set up shop in a spare bedroom of their condo before Amy Saad\u2019s pregnancy in 2007 convinced the couple that more traditional office space might be called for.\n\nAnd so began the opening day that never was \u2014 a frantic 24-hour period that was pushed aside to make room for a newborn baby.\n\n\u201cWe were supposed to open Dec. 8, 2007, but we were getting the computers up and running when my wife\u2019s water broke at around noon,\u201d recalled Sam Saad, a Nebraska native and Creighton University law school graduate who was working two other jobs at the time his daughter, Lola, was born. \u201cIt was a lot of excitement and a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nNot to mention a testament to Amy Saad\u2019s remarkable recovery ability.\n\n\u201cI spent the next 12 to 15 hours in the hospital, needed a few days, then went back to work a week later,\u201d said Amy Saad, who would go on to also give birth to Sam Saad IV a few years later. \u201cIt was a very crazy week. Very exciting, very crazy and very scary.\u201d\n\nSince those early days, Sam Saad III said, everything has been smooth sailing as he has watched his burgeoning business grow to 12 employees and into the much larger space on Airport-Pulling Road South.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll rent the top floor for a little while as we grow into the space,\u201d he said. \u201cParadise Coast Title and Escrow will be on the first floor, and we\u2019ll have the law office on the second floor. Our clients will have a much nicer experience, with more comfortable surroundings and better technology. It will be easier and more efficient, not to mention the proximity to the courthouse.\n\nWe\u2019ll be across the street now, so it will be two minutes to the courthouse instead of 15. The overall operation will be much more efficient.\u201d\n\nAs a family man himself, Saad said he understands the complexities of juggling work and family.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a very family-friendly business,\u201d he said. \u201cOf our 12 employees, including me, seven have minor children, so if somebody\u2019s kid is sick, somebody has to take care of them. I\u2019m very flexible as long as the work gets done. We\u2019re a small firm, but we offer health care benefits so the employees don\u2019t have to worry about the implications of Obamacare (The Affordable Care Act).\u201d\n\nClaudia Alusma, 23, an Immokalee native and recent Florida Atlantic University graduate, has worked as Saad\u2019s marketing assistant for the past three weeks. Alusma said she appreciated the help she has received at her new job.\n\n\u201cSo far, I\u2019m loving the environment,\u201d she said. \u201cI love the way the office is set up, and I like that the employees here are very knowledgeable and skilled at what they\u2019re doing. They\u2019re helping me to learn and get into the marketing world. Plus, Sam is a great leader, and I\u2019m excited to be a part of his growing firm.\u201d\n\nA city councilman since 2010, Saad he wears his different hats to the best of his abilities each day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a balancing act every day to get the legal work done, be a good representative for my constituents and make time for my kids and wife,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a great staff, and that helps a lot. I know everyone says it, but they\u2019re the best. They work hard every day, and they\u2019re dedicated professionals who make a huge difference.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"title": "Sam Saad to expand legal operations", "og": {"url": "http://www.naplesnews.com/news/sam-saad-to-expand-legal-operations-ep-736758280-330715501.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/dm_samsaad_45_9422659_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 427}, "type": "article", "description": "It has been a labor of love since the beginning for Sam Saad III and his family.", "title": "Sam Saad to expand legal operations"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/dm_samsaad_45_9422659_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "It has been a labor of love since the beginning for Sam Saad III and his family.", "site": "@ndn", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Sam Saad to expand legal operations"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-ndn-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9d34\"", "article_summary": "(Dania Maxwell/Staff)By John OsborneIt has been a labor of love since the beginning for Sam Saad III and his family.\nIt was purchased by Naples City Councilman Sam Saad III, who plans to move his firm to the location Dec. 15.\n\u201cI spent the next 12 to 15 hours in the hospital, needed a few days, then went back to work a week later,\u201d said Amy Saad, who would go on to also give birth to Sam Saad IV a few years later.\nThe overall operation will be much more efficient.\u201dAs a family man himself, Saad said he understands the complexities of juggling work and family.\nThey work hard every day, and they\u2019re dedicated professionals who make a huge difference.\u201d"}
