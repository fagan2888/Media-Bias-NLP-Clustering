For Green, a 6-foot-5, 255-pound chiseled beast, his road to recognition has been paved in dirt, grass, mud and muscle.\n\nIt started in Nevada, where it\u2019s not uncommon for folks to straddle the line between dreams and delusion. Green wanted to play college football. He figured he could be a star receiver for the Wolf Pack, a team that featured quarterback Colin Kaepernick and linebacker Brandon Marshall.\n\nThe coaches moved him to tight end.\n\nBroncos Mailbag: Pose a question for Mike Klis\n\n\u201cAnd I hated it. I hated blocking,\u201d Green said. \u201cBut I started to get recognition from not only my teammates and coaches, but the media for springing guys for touchdowns. I realized how valuable my role was. Whatever my job is blocking, I want to do it well and look physical doing it.\u201d\n\nThe startling transformation from a 215-pound college freshman into an earth mover for the Broncos\u2019 revived running game draws comparisons to Bruce Banner\u2019s ripped jeans and anger management issues. That\u2019s fine by Green. Long ago, he began calling himself the Hulk, a nod to his last name and adoration for the comic book character who wreaks havoc. Virgil\u2019s younger brother Jeremiah, a former Nevada star who last played in the Canadian Football League, fueled the vision, answering to the nickname Green Goblin.\n\n\u201cHe was the villain because he was the linebacker. The Hulk, man, the last four years if it comes on, I watch the entire movie. I love it,\u201d Green said. \u201cWe fed off it. We played together at Nevada.\u201d\n\nBroncos fans know Green better now than at any time during his previous three seasons. Offensive coordinator Adam Gase and quarterback Peyton Manning hinted of his value after the early-season loss at Seattle when Green exited with a first-half concussion. His importance became apparent over the season\u2019s final six games during which Green has played roughly 70 percent of the snaps because of Julius Thomas\u2019 lingering ankle sprain.\n\nDenver committed to the run after a humbling loss at St. Louis. The Broncos improved from 89.9 yards rushing per game, ranking 27th overall, to 111.6, which sits 15th in the league.\n\nAdding an extra \u201ctackle\u201d and leaning on Green as a blocker helped breathe life into the ground game. It is a weapon that didn\u2019t exist consistently last season, which creates confidence for their Jan. 11 postseason opener.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen how successful it can be. I am going to really come out and be an animal in the playoffs,\u201d Green said. \u201cI will be firing off the ball to make sure to move my guy and make sure that our running back has a clean read.\u201d\n\nGreen\u2019s presence and production is a microcosm of an evolving offense. The Broncos want Thomas as a weapon near the end zone, but he admits he hasn\u2019t been himself. He hopes that with the bye that he can \u201cget over the hump and get back to guy I used to be.\u201d Since that is no longer a certainty, Green\u2019s impact can\u2019t be overstated.\n\nKnown as a bruiser, he has shown finesse, providing evidence that he shouldn\u2019t be typecast. Gase said Green deserves credit for taking advantage of additional practice reps, insisting he \u201ctrusts\u201d Green in the passing game.\n\n\u201cAt Nevada, I didn\u2019t learn much about route running and how to get open against different coverages. It\u2019s just been a learning process, learning how Peyton (Manning) talks, learning how the coaches talk. Julius has done a great job of adjusting well. His mind wasn\u2019t molded like mine was,\u201d Green said. \u201cHe had a free mind to work with. Watching him and seeing how he\u2019s getting open has truly helped me to start to understand things better.\u201d\n\nManning discussed his desire to get Green a touchdown for weeks. He didn\u2019t throw the pass to Green last Sunday, but he called the play.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying like crazy to get him one,\u201d Manning said of the 1-yard scoring toss from Brock Osweiler. \u201cIt was good Virgil got his.\u201d\n\nThe reaction of teammates explained Green\u2019s popularity in the locker room. They rushed to greet him, knowing how long he had waited for the opportunity.\n\nGreen couldn\u2019t hide his smile. The Raiders probably were better off not making him angry. Opponents don\u2019t seem to like him much when he\u2019s angry.\n\n\u201cWhen I was at Nevada, I started to bulk up in the weight room. I worked extremely hard to become the best pound-for-pound lifter,\u201d Green said. \u201cBut at the end of day, regardless of my weight, it\u2019s about coming off the ball and hitting the guy across from me. That\u2019s what is going on in my head. I don\u2019t care how big the guy is. It means nothing. I have to impose my will.\u201d\n\nTroy E.
