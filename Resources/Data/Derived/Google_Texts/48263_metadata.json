We can only warn people to not take it up.\"\n\nUnder the country's Computer Crimes Act, passed in 2007, it's illegal to post content that \"causes public panic\" or \"any obscene computer data which is accessible to the public.\" The Thai Culture Watch Office said that photos featuring the lower half of women's breasts could be considered a violation of the law.\n\nIt's not surprising that Thailand's military government is as authoritarian about underboob as it is about everything else.
