Terms weren\u2019t disclosed.\n\nThe Palo Alto-based startup specialized in taking data from a variety of modern databases and migrating it into Amazon\u2019s online archiving service named Redshift. The company had received $2 million in funding from Data Collective, Andreessen Horowitz, Ignition Partners and others.\n\nAmazon doesn\u2019t acquire many companies for its Amazon Web Services cloud division, instead investing heavily in internal research and development. Acquisition targets typically are small companies that fill a particular niche, such as 2lemetry, an Internet-of-Things firm Amazon purchased last month, and Israeli semiconductor startup Annapurna Labs, which the online retailer agreed to buy in January.\n\nOne use of Amiato\u2019s technology is to take data kept in modern databases, such as MongoDB, and load it into Amazon\u2019s Redshift. Amiato employees have subsequently gone to work in Amazon\u2019s database and Redshift product groups, according to posts on LinkedIn.\n\nSpokeswomen for Seattle-based Amazon didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment on the deal.\n\nAmazon introduced its first set of Web-services products almost 10 years ago. The business division in which Web-services sales are logged brought in $1.67 billion in sales in the company\u2019s most recent quarter. Amazon will start breaking out its Web-services unit as its own line item later this month when it reports its next quarterly earnings.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jack Clark", "twitter": {"description": "Amazon.com Inc. is said to have acquired data-migration startup Amiato last year, giving the online retailer the brains behind a technology that makes it easier to pour data into Amazon\u2019s cloud services.", "title": "Amazon Acquired Data Migration Startup Amiato", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-10/amazon-acquired-data-migration-startup-amiato", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ipcT1QBYRbWU/v3/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Jack Clark", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Amazon.com Inc,Tech", "news_keywords": "Amazon.com Inc,Tech", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-10/amazon-acquired-data-migration-startup-amiato", "parsely-title": "Amazon Acquired Data Migration Startup Amiato", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-04-10T20:40:54.266Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Amazon.com Inc. is said to have acquired data-migration startup Amiato last year, giving the online retailer the brains behind a technology that makes it easier to pour data into Amazon\u2019s cloud services.", "parsely-tags": "Amazon.com Inc,Tech,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-04-10T20:40:54.266Z", "parsely-section": "technology", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Amazon.com Inc. is said to have acquired data-migration startup Amiato last year, giving the online retailer the brains behind a technology that makes it easier to pour data into Amazon\u2019s cloud services.", "title": "Amazon Acquired Data Migration Startup Amiato", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-10/amazon-acquired-data-migration-startup-amiato", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ipcT1QBYRbWU/v3/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "Amazon.com Inc. is said to have acquired data-migration startup Amiato last year, giving the online retailer the brains behind a technology that makes it easier to pour data into Amazon\u2019s cloud services."}, "parsely-post-id": "NMLQO76VDKI001", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ipcT1QBYRbWU/v3/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca192\"", "article_summary": "The business division in which Web-services sales are logged brought in $1.67 billion in sales in the company\u2019s most recent quarter.\nAmazon.com Inc. is said to have acquired data-migration startup Amiato last year, giving the online retailer the brains behind a technology that makes it easier to pour data into Amazon\u2019s cloud services.\nThe Palo Alto-based startup specialized in taking data from a variety of modern databases and migrating it into Amazon\u2019s online archiving service named Redshift.\nOne use of Amiato\u2019s technology is to take data kept in modern databases, such as MongoDB, and load it into Amazon\u2019s Redshift.\nAmazon bought Amiato for the skills of its employees, according to a person familiar with the matter who wasn\u2019t authorized to speak publicly about the deal."}
