But both forces could run up against a counter-force: a shortage of psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors and therapists in much of the country.\n\nMore than half of U.S. counties have no mental health professionals and so \"don't have any access whatsoever,\" according to Thomas Insel, director of the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\nThe implications are significant.\n\nNearly one in five adults -- about 43 million people -- had a diagnosable mental disorder within the past year. For nearly 10 million, the condition was serious enough to affect their ability to function day to day. Millions of adolescents also struggle with a debilitating mental disorder.\n\n[Months of deadly shootings are pushing mental-health legislation forward in Congress]\n\nMany people have become eligible for mental health coverage under the 2010 Affordable Care Act.

Rural areas face some of the biggest deficits.\n\n\"It is a serious shortage, especially in certain parts of the country,\" said Renee Binder, president of the American Psychiatric Association.\n\nThe lack of psychiatrists and other mental-health providers is part of an overall shortage of physicians in the United States. Earlier this year, a study by the Association of American Medical Colleges concluded that the nation will face a deficit of between 46,000 and 90,400 doctors within a decade. While primary care doctors will certainly be in short supply, it said, the biggest deficits may be among specialist physicians who care for the elderly, including psychiatrists.\n\nExperts cite inadequate reimbursement from government and private insurance plans as one factor.\n\n\"A medical student leaves medical school and residency with the same amount of debt no matter their specialty, yet primary care and psychiatry are professions with some of the lowest annual salaries,\" said Chuck Ingoglia, senior vice president for public policy at the National Council for Behavioral Health. \"Which one would a smart, ambitious young person choose?\"\n\nOr put another way: \"If you look at the valuation for an hour of therapy, you could say we pay plumbers, carpenters and handymen more than we pay for behavioral health,\" said Paul Gionfriddo, president of Mental Health America.\n\nRead more:\n\nWomen more likely to have serious mental health problems than men, study says\n\nNIH's mental health chief on why he's leaving for Google: Technology may hold key to better diagnosis\n\nMost Americans will get a wrong diagnosis at least once in their lives\n\nNearly one-third of teens changed health habits based on online search\n\nFor more health news, you can sign up for our weekly newsletter here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Even as demand for mental health services grow, the shortage of psychiatrists and related professionals is getting worse.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/lena.sun.90", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Even as demand for mental health services grow, the shortage of psychiatrists and related professionals is getting worse.", "title": "Why it\u2019s so hard to find a mental health professional", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/10/22/why-its-so-hard-to-find-a-mental-health-professional/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2015/10/depression.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@bylenasun"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/10/22/why-its-so-hard-to-find-a-mental-health-professional/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "mental health, mental illness, psychiatrists, shortages, Congress,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/lena.sun.90"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "mental health, mental illness, psychiatrists, shortages, Congress,"}, "article_summary": "Woman sitting on sofa and crying with therapist taking notes (Bigstock)The demand for mental health services is growing nationally, and comprehensive mental health legislation is gaining momentum in Congress for the first time in years.\nMore than half of U.S. counties have no mental health professionals and so \"don't have any access whatsoever,\" according to Thomas Insel, director of the National Institute of Mental Health.\nRead more:Women more likely to have serious mental health problems than men, study saysNIH's mental health chief on why he's leaving for Google: Technology may hold key to better diagnosisMost Americans will get a wrong diagnosis at least once in their livesNearly one-third of teens changed health habits based on online searchFor more health news, you can sign up for our weekly newsletter here.\n[Months of deadly shootings are pushing mental-health legislation forward in Congress]Many people have become eligible for mental health coverage under the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\nOr put another way: \"If you look at the valuation for an hour of therapy, you could say we pay plumbers, carpenters and handymen more than we pay for behavioral health,\" said Paul Gionfriddo, president of Mental Health America."}
