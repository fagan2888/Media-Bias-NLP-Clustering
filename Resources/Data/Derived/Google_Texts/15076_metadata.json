He was up at 3 a.m. to run the local morning show circuits encouraging even more people to an event that can barely accommodate the estimated 70,000 people already attending. Along with Show Director Ben Stevens, Programming Director Mark Walters, and Volunteer Coordinator Tracy Kelly, Devin struggles to prevent the organized chaos of the Dallas Comic Con from descending into the real thing \u2014 and the effort clearly exhausts him.\n\nOn the eve of the convention, as I waited in line for a press credential I would never receive,* I met a woman dressed as a S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent who kept referring to \u201cthe Director,\u201d and it wasn\u2019t until someone else asked her where \u201cDirector Pike\u201d got off to that the reference sunk in \u2014 and the comparison is apt, as both are in partially in charge of large, loosely knit organizations that always seems on the verge of falling apart and yet somehow still operate.\n\n*I was told by the media agency running the press that neither Salon nor the Onion have sufficient \u201creach.\u201d One of their people \u201clooked at the circulation numbers and they just didn\u2019t compete\u201d with those who had been awarded credentials, which could only mean everyone else covering the convention worked for online pornography and kitten photos.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t surprise you, then, that the Director was able to score me a pass* that afforded me access not merely equivalent to, but greater than, that of the press \u2014 and one which I quickly, albeit accidentally, abused by following a bald man through a guarded door, almost ending up on stage with \u201cThe X-Files\u201d\u2018 Mitch Pileggi. The door was manned by one of the legion of volunteers who keep the conference\u2019s inherent anarchy in check by dint of a pleasant demeanor.\n\n*Which I not only deserved, but which was absolutely necessary, given that I would be moderating a panel with Haruo Nakajima, Kenpachiro Satsuma, and Tsutomu Kitagawa \u2014 three of the men who portrayed the iconic monster \u201cGodzilla\u201d on the silver screen \u2014 on Sunday.\n\nAfter I scuttled out of the spotlight, I asked the woman in charge of this particular door why she let me through. \u201cYou looked like you knew where you were going,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you had a badge.\u201d I was tempted to reply that the point of badges is to prevent people who look like they know where they\u2019re going from just going anywhere, but she had a point \u2014 it\u2019s all about the badges.\n\nAnd by \u201cbadges,\u201d I mean \u201clanyards.\u201d Around the neck of every attendee hung a lanyard declaring where and when this particular individual could move about the conference. If yours read VIP, you were welcome almost anywhere at anytime \u2014 the front of the room, closest to the speaker, or the front of the line, first to acquire an audience. Premium, Deluxe, and Single Day followed suit, in descending order of importance.\n\nThe first panel Devin personally hosts is a little running late, which should\u2019ve been expected, given that it was a Q&A session with Sylvester McCoy, the Seventh Doctor. As many of his companions have learned the hard way, trusting the Doctor to show up on time is a fool\u2019s errand, and yet the crowd sat patiently, not the least bit concerned about whether he\u2019d arrive, or what mood he\u2019d be in when he does.\n\nWhen he finally did, he climbed onto the stage, under the table at which the interview would take place, and proceeded to regale the audience with tales of setting the world record for the number of ferrets a person can stuff in his pants.\n\n\u201cJust out of curiosity,\u201d Devin asked, \u201cwhat was the record?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was none! We invented it!\u201d he replied.\n\nBy the time McCoy\u2019s panel ended, it was 8:15 p.m. I\u2019d been there since seven hours, and had walked the 2 1/2 mile-long concourse at the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center eight or nine times and was, understandably, beyond beat. Devin had been up since 3 a.m. and ran that same stretch countless times \u201cputting out brush fires\u201d throughout the day. I could only imagine how he felt \u2014 and it was only Day 1.\n\nOn Day 2, I awoke at 3 a.m. to sound of thunder shaking my hotel room at the Dallas Omni. I don\u2019t mean this poetically \u2014 I mean I was near the top of a tall hotel in the middle of a raging thunderstorm and the thunder shook the walls with enough force to knock pictures to the floor.
