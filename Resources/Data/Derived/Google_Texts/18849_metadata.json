And when consumers now enter the lighting aisle, they face bulbs of various shapes, technologies and prices that make comparison shopping more difficult.\n\nOn top of all that, one type of light, called a light-emitting diode, or LED, is undergoing the rapid transformation of price and capability that shoppers more often see in computers and smartphones. It will last far longer than other light bulbs, but it\u2019s not as cheap, though some prices are now a fraction of what they were five years ago.\n\nAs she sized up all the lights at Ikea, Halsell, an interior designer, hesitated over style and price.\n\n\u201cI prefer incandescent,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess it\u2019s because it\u2019s what I grew up with.\u201d\n\nLEDs use 75 percent less energy and last 25 times as long as an incandescent bulb, according to Energy.gov. Replacing five of the most commonly used bulbs can save $75 in energy costs per year, according to the website. An average home has 50 to 80 light bulbs.\n\nThe change away from incandescents forced shoppers to flip their cost expectations. For decades, people bought cheap bulbs that cost more to run. Now, they\u2019re encountering bulbs that cost more but are cheap to run.\n\nHalsell examined two LEDs because she thought the fixtures she was buying would only accept them. But the prices of the LED bulbs, $4.49 and $6.99, made her pause. \u201cThese prices are high, and I don\u2019t think they last as long as they say they will,\u201d she said.\n\nShe\u2019s not alone in her reluctance. Consumers are increasingly turning to halogen bulbs, despite their poor energy consumption relative to LEDs and another type, compact fluorescents, or CFLs.\n\nMarket data shows that sales of halogen bulbs rose sharply last year while CFLs fell. The average price for both halogens and CFLs is around $2, well below the LED price average of $10.70. Some market watchers have predicted LED bulbs will take off when their average price reaches $10, though others think they will need to fall much more.\n\nPrices for LEDs are falling nearly as fast as computer chips. In 2009, a 60-watt-equivalent bulb from Philips was $40. Home Depot now sells a more energy-efficient version from Cree Inc., an early innovator in LED technology, for $6.97.\n\nJohn Ewoldt,\n\nStar Tribune (Minneapolis)", "article_metadata": {"description": "The change away from incandescents forced shoppers to flip their cost expectations.", "og": {"description": "The change away from incandescents forced shoppers to flip their cost expectations.", "title": "In the light bulb aisle, bright ideas and plenty of confusion", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150221-in-the-light-bulb-aisle-bright-ideas-and-plenty-of-confusion.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150221-biz_pfp-lightbulbs-bizplus_ms_42286529.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/BIZ_PFP-LIGHTBULBS-BIZPLUS_MS_42286529.JPG", "height": 853}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-02-22T02:49:17Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-02-22T02:49:17Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"In the light bulb aisle, bright ideas and plenty of confusion\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150221-in-the-light-bulb-aisle-bright-ideas-and-plenty-of-confusion.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150221-biz_pfp-lightbulbs-bizplus_ms_42286529.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/BIZ_PFP-LIGHTBULBS-BIZPLUS_MS_42286529.JPG\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2190133\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-02-22T02:49:17Z\", \"section\": \"Economy & You Headlines\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150221-biz_pfp-lightbulbs-bizplus_ms_42286529.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/BIZ_PFP-LIGHTBULBS-BIZPLUS_MS_42286529.JPG", "publishtime": "2015-02-22T02:49:17Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "The average price for both halogens and CFLs is around $2, well below the LED price average of $10.70.\nMINNEAPOLIS \u2014 While shopping at Ikea recently, Liz Halsall confronted a problem that\u2019s confused many shoppers the past few years: which light bulb to buy.\nIt will last far longer than other light bulbs, but it\u2019s not as cheap, though some prices are now a fraction of what they were five years ago.\nAn average home has 50 to 80 light bulbs.\nSome market watchers have predicted LED bulbs will take off when their average price reaches $10, though others think they will need to fall much more."}
