And the sky started falling with speculation.\n\nThe Rockies\u2019 all-star shortstop is on the East Coast to visit with Dr. William Meyers, a surgeon who specializes in sports injuries, in Philadelphia.\n\nAnd Tulo\u2019s visit to Yankee Stadium was only that, he said \u2014 a visit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a short drive from Philly. I\u2019m with my family. I wanted to see (Derek) Jeter play one more time,\u201d Tulowitzki told The Denver Post.\n\nA Tulowitzki trade is not imminent, to the Yankees or otherwise, a major-league source confirmed.\n\nTulowitzki, who is on the Rockies\u2019 15-day disabled list with a high thigh injury (technically a left hip-flexor strain), on Saturday night flew to Philadelphia for a consultation with the doctor who performed his sports hernia surgery in 2012.\n\nOn Monday, Tulowitzki will receive \u201cdry needling\u201d therapy on his leg, Rockies head athletic trainer Keith Dugger said. The procedure is meant to increase blood flow to an injured muscle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not very invasive,\u201d Dugger said. \u201cWe do it all the time here, and he\u2019s had it done before.\u201d\n\nBut Tulowitzki\u2019s appearance at Yankee Stadium, one day after the Rockies\u2019 misspelled \u201cTulowizki\u201d jersey giveaway at Coors Field, only fueled the Tulo trade rumors.\n\nThe New York Post last week reported the Mets had contacted the Rockies about trade possibilities.\n\nTulowitzki is eligible to return off the DL on Aug. 5.\n\nIn 2012, Tulowitzki played just 47 games in part because of the sports hernia surgery. Meyers removed scar tissue that was irritating a nerve in his groin.\n\nTulowitzki\u2019s high thigh strain is not the same injury, but the muscles involved are in the same area. And it\u2019s possible Tulowitzki was overcompensating and stressing a hip flexor because of the 2012 injury.\n\nTulowitzki, by the way, showed up in the Bronx with a T-shirt that read at the top \u201cThere\u2019s Always Money\u2026\u201d Stop reading into it. It ends with \u201cIn Banana Stands.\u201d It\u2019s an Arrested Development reference.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Keith Dugger,Philadelphia,Troy Tulowitzki,Yankee Stadium", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Troy Tulowitzki showed up at Yankee Stadium on Sunday to catch the New York-Toronto game.
