Michael Leavitt during an HX360 event at HIMSS16 on Wednesday.\n\nLeavitt asked the question that has been buzzing around political circles and social media in recent weeks: Will he join the presidential race?\n\n\u201cWhat happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas,\u201d Romney joked. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not getting in.\u201d\n\nWith the question of the moment answered, Romney settled into a casual conversation around the fascinating 2016 presidential race.\n\nThe former Massachusetts Gov. said any of the remaining Republican candidates would replace Obamacare and lean on tax credits to get citizens insured. But that might be where the similarities end between his view of Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.\n\n\u201cIf Mr. Trump became president, I think he\u2019d look to the House \u2013 and I don\u2019t know that because he hasn\u2019t described a comprehensive plan \u2013 but I think he\u2019d look to Mr. Ryan and the House to move toward refundable tax credits for buying insurance, with an emphasis on health savings accounts,\u201d Romney said. \u201cInsurance would be a benefit, not deductible. Look for an at-risk pool funded by feds for people with pre-existing conditions.\u201d\n\n[Also: See photos from Day 2 of HIMSS16]\n\nRomney added that if Rubio, Cruz or Ohio Gov. John Kasich won the White House, each would likely put a finger on the scales, but would take a similar direction as Trump.\n\nWith his big wins on Super Tuesday, Trump has 319 delegates to Cruz\u2019s 226 delegates. But Romney said the Presidential race \u201cis still a contest,\u201d among Republicans.\n\nAs for the Democrats, Romney said they would likely keep Obamacare, though there might be a few changes made.\n\n\u201cIf Hillary gets elected you might see some adjustments to Obamacare, but the House wouldn\u2019t go along with Bernie Sanders-style expansion,\u201d Romney said. \u201cIf Bernie were president, federal regulators would play a larger role in healthcare and be more demanding of insurance companies and providers.\u201d\n\nThat point, however, might be moot in relatively short order. When asked if the Clinton-Sanders battle is over Romney answered: \u201cI think so.\u201d\n\nRomney also acknowledged that Obamacare is the law of the land and reflected on his own proposal to improve healthcare in America.\n\n\u201cMy own view was to say that each state is responsible for getting 95 percent of its people insured but it\u2019s up to each state how to do it,\u201d Romney said.\n\nIf Vermont wants single-payer, let them try it, and if other states want to replicate what he did in Massachusetts they would be free to pursue that avenue, he said.\n\n\u201cGiven the fact that Obamacare has been implemented and is now in place, it\u2019s hard to go back to the model I proposed,\u201d Romney said. \u201cPresident Obama \u2013 thanks so much \u2013 went out and told everybody Romneycare was the grandfather of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nAs for the election, Romney said he believes the Republicans need a fresh face to beat the Democrats, someone people didn\u2019t know before the race began. Though he also said Florida Sen. Marco Rubio or Texas Sen. Ted Cruz would have a better chance of beating Hillary Clinton than he does.\n\nTwitter: @SullyHIT\n\nThis story is part of our ongoing coverage of the HIMSS16 conference.
