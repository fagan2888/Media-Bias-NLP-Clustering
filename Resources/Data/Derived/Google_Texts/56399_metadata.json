The answer was a diplomatic \"no.\"\n\nHH: Can Elizabeth Warren beat her?\n\n\n\nDA: I don\u2019t think Elizabeth, I know Elizabeth Warren well, and my strong feeling is she\u2019s not going to run. I think she\u2019s trying to influence the direction of the party, and you have more influence as a potential candidate than you do if you take yourself out. So she\u2019s allowing, she\u2019s sticking to this language of I\u2019m not running for president, and titillating people with it, because it gives her more leverage. I don\u2019t think she would beat her. I have high regard for Elizabeth. I don\u2019t think she would beat her. Look, look at the polling, Hugh. Hillary is probably as well-positioned within her own party as any open seat candidate has been in our lifetime. And you know, she\u2019s going to have to go out and work for it. If she assumes anything and doesn\u2019t go out and work for it, and earn it, and make her case and present her, a rationale for a candidacy that resonates with people, then anybody is vulnerable under those circumstances. But you know, I know the team she\u2019s assembling. I have a high regard for them. I have some sense of the kind of thinking she\u2019s doing. I think she\u2019s going to come out of the gate very strong.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice how Axelrod starts the interview by claiming he doesn't believe Warren will run and then goes into detail about the team she's assembling to make a bid for the White House.\n\nMeanwhile Vice President Joe Biden seems to be fading from 2016 presidential talk despite a trip to Iowa today and past statements about his desire to run.\n\nBehind the scenes, though, there are few signs the vice president is taking steps toward mounting a third bid for the top job at the White House. As Hillary Rodham Clinton builds an elaborate campaign-in-waiting, and a few other Democrats nibble around the edges, Biden's name has faded from the mix of expected 2016 candidates.\n\n\n\nBiden's aides and longtime political advisers say he isn't organizing in early voting states such as New Hampshire and Iowa, although he'll visit Des Moines on Thursday. He has yet to form an exploratory committee or other apparatus that could rapidly scale up to become a campaign.\n\n\n\nAlthough he stays in close touch with former political aides, no staff has been lined up to take on key roles in a potential bid. Nor are any Democrats in the early voting states organizing a \"Draft Joe\" movement \u2014 the pining of those who aren't ready for Hillary is reserved for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Competition. .05/26/2016 4:10:54AM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Competition.", "title": "Katie Pavlich - Axelrod: Elizabeth Warren Can't Beat Hillary Clinton", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/02/12/axelrod-elizabeth-warren-cant-beat-hillary-clinton-n1956506", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/32/ce3a01f4-d880-40a1-911d-7495fcbf7381.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Competition.", "title": "Katie Pavlich - Axelrod: Elizabeth Warren Can't Beat Hillary Clinton", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/02/12/axelrod-elizabeth-warren-cant-beat-hillary-clinton-n1956506", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/32/ce3a01f4-d880-40a1-911d-7495fcbf7381.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Axelrod: Elizabeth Warren Can't Beat Hillary Clinton, Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdedf\"", "article_summary": "DA: I don\u2019t think Elizabeth, I know Elizabeth Warren well, and my strong feeling is she\u2019s not going to run.\nHH: Can Elizabeth Warren beat her?\nDuring an interview with former Obama White House advisor David Axelrod yesterday, conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt asked if Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has a chance at defeating Clinton.\nAnd you know, she\u2019s going to have to go out and work for it.\nI think she\u2019s going to come out of the gate very strong."}
