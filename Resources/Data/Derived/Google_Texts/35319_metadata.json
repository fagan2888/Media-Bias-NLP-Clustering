Emphasis on \u2018potential.\u2019\n\nFacing a Republican-led Senate, President Obama soon may be hosting GOP leader Mitch McConnell at the White House, after the veteran lawmaker won a sixth six-year Senate term in Kentucky. Last year, buoyed by his 2012 reelection, Obama dismissed the notion of schmoozing with his Republican tormentors on Capitol Hill. People keep asking him, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get a drink with Mitch McConnell?\u201d he wisecracked at the White House Correspondents Association dinner.\n\nNow Obama will have to spend more time than he\u2019d like with the GOP, or else kiss goodbye to the last two years of his legislative legacy. \u201cThere are incentives, small incentives on both sides to show they can actually accomplish something,\u201d says Elaine Kamarck, senior fellow in the Governance Studies program at the Brookings Institution. \u201cBut they\u2019re small and not very high salience,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing the big middle class can jump up and down about.\u201d\n\nKamarck nominates Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) and corporate tax reform. They aren\u2019t bell-ringers but could end the gridlock to get Congress functioning again. TPA would allow Obama to conclude negotiations on a major trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). It\u2019s something Obama wants, and so does the GOP. Corporate tax reform is another area ripe for a deal. The United States has the highest corporate tax in the world at 35 percent, and the recent wave of \u201cinversions,\u201d with major companies moving their address overseas to avoid paying billions in taxes, has lent bipartisan urgency to the reform effort.\n\nJohn Feehery, who served as communications director to former House Speaker Dennis Hastert, cautions that any tax reform will be lauded by big business, but individual rates won\u2019t be touched. \u201cIndividuals won\u2019t get anything out of it,\u201d he says. William Galston, a senior fellow at Brookings, takes a different view because of the players that will lead the tax-reform effort. Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, who was a good friend of the late Democrat Ted Kennedy, and who works well across the aisle, will chair the Senate Finance Committee. Rep. Paul Ryan, a potential presidential candidate with an eye to boosting the GOP\u2019s populist credentials, is assuming the helm of the House Ways and Means Committee, where tax legislation originates. \u201cThat\u2019s a team reasonable people can do business with,\u201d says Galston.\n\nThere will be an early vote on the Keystone XL pipeline, which enough Democrats support to assure passage. Obama has been cagey about where he stands, not wanting to anger environmentalists. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if he vetoes it,\u201d says Feehery. \u201cThey\u2019ll present it to him.\u201d Lifting the tax on medical devices, imposed as part of the Affordable Care Act, is another issue that if put to a vote would prevail with the help of Democrats. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Al Franken are among those who oppose the tax because of its impact on device makers in their states.\n\nSpending on infrastructure used to be an easy bipartisan win, and with the GOP in charge, they\u2019ll be less paranoid about Democrats turning it into a handout to unions. Other less obvious areas of potential agreement are criminal-justice reform and voting rights. Republican Rand Paul, another likely presidential contender, is pushing the idea that nonviolent offenders, especially in drug-related crimes, should receive lesser sentences, and that once they\u2019ve repaid their debt to society, should have their voting rights restored. Passing a new voting-rights bill after the Supreme Court gutted the historic Voting Rights Act in 2013 is \u201ca little bit of a stretch,\u201d says Feehery, but Republicans are \u201cfeeling the heat\u201d for voter-suppression tactics in a number of states, and when Congress reauthorized the VRA in 2006, it passed both houses with large bipartisan margins.\n\nImmigration reform is on the White House wish list, and Obama has boxed himself in promising executive action first by the end of summer, then after the midterms. He can\u2019t punt again. Progressives want bold action while Obama doesn\u2019t want to foreclose the possibility that Congress might act. One suggestion bandied about among progressives is that Obama go public with exactly what he plans to do in granting legal status to some portion of the 11 million people in the country illegally, borrowing from a bipartisan bill that passed the Senate last year with a commanding 68 votes in favor.\n\nObama would then give Congress an ultimatum: Act by a certain date, perhaps a hundred days into the new Congress, or he will. Admittedly it would be called a stunt, but Obama needs something dramatic to rejuvenate his leadership. Some advocates think he should go to Capitol Hill and stay there as a hands-on leader, lobbying like he was LBJ reborn until he gets action on the country\u2019s key priorities.\n\nMore likely, the road ahead will be paved by small accomplishments as opposed to grand bargains that would rattle the rough equilibrium between the two parties as they position themselves for the presidential sweepstakes. Republicans need to rebuild their brand, which Rand Paul said quite graphically \u201csucks.\u201d Feehery recalls how the GOP rebuilt its tattered image after the Clinton impeachment triggered a voter backlash that left Republicans reeling. They did it with what Feehery calls \u201croutine governance.\u201d They passed appropriations bills, and they went against stereotype with a \u201cnew markets\u201d bill aimed at minority communities that \u201cshowed we weren\u2019t toxic, we didn\u2019t hate black people, we care about them,\u201d and they passed a prescription-drug bill for seniors that is wildly popular today. \u201cWe restored our brand, showed we could govern, we took the temperature down,\u201d says Feehery. \u201cI was quoted in The New York Times saying, \u2018We dared to be dull\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe alternate view among Republicans, says Feehery, is to let the bright lines shine; why give Obama any opportunities for bipartisan victories, on the theory that a failing president makes it harder for Democrats to argue for a third term. \u201cMcConnell\u2019s biggest impediment is Ted Cruz,\u201d says Feehery. \u201cHe wants to repeal Obamacare, and he wants to be confrontational.\u201d A newly empowered McConnell should be able to stand up to Cruz. The bigger question is what House Speaker John Boehner will do. \u201cDoes he want to be remembered as someone who never got anything done?\u201d says Galston, who points out that Boehner is one of the biggest beneficiaries of a Republican Senate. \u201cHe can tell his caucus they\u2019re shooting with real bullets, they can pass legislation, they\u2019re not shooting with blanks anymore.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "eleanorclift"}, "keywords": "House of Representatives, 2014 Midterms, Barack Obama, Congress, Google, Republican Party, u.s. poli, 2014 Election, United States Senate", "publicationDate": 201411042150, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "There are many potential areas for deal-making\u2014trade, corporate tax reform, modest ACA adjustments, and more.
