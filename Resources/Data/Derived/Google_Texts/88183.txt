BancorpSouth has more than 200,000 customers who like to do their banking online, but many of those customers have had trouble accessing their accounts.

Apparently, an upgrade over the weekend to the company’s website hit a few bumps in the past couple of days.

The Tupelo-based bank upgraded its online banking portal on Sunday, but many customers couldn’t access the website or smartphone apps. Screen prompts didn’t work, for example, and customers couldn’t get to their accounts.

On top of that, when customers tried calling the customer support line, many were unable to get through, meeting with an immediate busy signal. The company’s support center was inundated with the sheer volume of calls, thus causing the busy signal.

Randy Burchfield, BancorpSouth’s vice president of corporate communications, said some technical glitches affected service, but added that the bank was working quickly to work the kinks out. Website activity and phone volume also is expected to lessen over the next few days, he said.
