Merry Christmas, everybody! Here, have some health insurance.

About 8.3 million people have signed up for health coverage through Healthcare.gov's 2016 open enrollment period, the Obama administration announced Tuesday. That beats last year's total of 6.4 million people who had signed up at the same point in time.

The even better news? Young people are signing up for insurance.

[T]he Obamacare population is increasingly made up of young enrollees who likely have lower health-care costs. This is especially good news after the wave of big premium spikes that this year's shoppers faced. It suggests that the higher price tags didn't scare off insurers' most-desired customers: young people who tend to have fewer medical needs.

And those young'uns will get a taste of a wonderful, miraculous world in which one accidental injury does not necessarily doom you to bankruptcy and years of poverty, so that's a plus.

Heaven knows the law still has hurdles to overcome, what with every Republican running for every office vowing to bury it because reasonsâ€”but this is still some very good news.
