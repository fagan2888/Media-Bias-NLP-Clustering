With the vast array of technologies at one\u2019s disposal \u2014 both paid and free \u2014 like VPNs, proxies, and services like Tor, curious dissenters have consistently proven that \u2013 with enough tinkering \u2013 they can circumvent many degrees of government censorship.\n\nNow another contender is looking to join the fray.\n\nA cabal of privacy-focused developers in California has just launched a Kickstarter campaign to mass-produce and distribute a small gadget called the \u201cAnonabox.\u201d Costing just $45 and roughly half the size of a pack of cigarettes, the Anonabox will have the ability to be connected to the user\u2019s router, instantly directing all their web traffic through the Tor network \u2014 effectively making them completely anonymous and theoretically allowing them passage through government-sanctioned blocks, like China\u2019s \u201cgreat firewall.\u201d\n\nOf course, as this is still only a prototype, there\u2019s no guarantee that the Anonabox will work with every government roadblock. However, the people behind the Tor project have a long history of quickly finding workarounds for these, patching the software sometimes mere hours after a regime tightens their firewalls.\n\nRelated: The Internet Scam That Hijacks Your Hard Drive\n\nThe Tor network (Tor stands for \u201cThe Onion Router\u201d), a service that bounces web traffic through a series of encrypted nodes and effectively anonymizes everything that passes through it, has been around for a while. Indeed, Tor has long been a requirement for those intrepid Internet explorers who decide to brave the deep web.\n\nSetting up TOR has always been a rather fiddly affair, though, requiring several configuration steps and a specialized browser. The Anonabox aims to remove all that hassle and make TOR more accessible to the average user. It also allows for traffic from other programs, like Skype, to be routed through Tor, which wasn\u2019t previously possible.\n\nIt\u2019s important to mention that due to newer tracking technologies like \u201cbrowser fingerprinting,\u201d which tracks your identity in a different manner than what TOR protects against, the box alone is not enough for users to browse the Internet completely anonymously. To further avoid being tracked, security experts also recommend using Tor\u2019s specialized browser, according to Wired.\n\nRelated: \u2018Shellshock\u2019 Threatens 500 Million Computers\n\nThough the majority of the developers\u2019 Kickstarter pitch hinges on the value of the device to activists in countries with human rights issues (the original prototype of the device was inspired by the Arab Spring protests four years ago, according to the Kickstarter), as well as journalists covering these issues, the device might also potentially be used maliciously. Indeed, having an instant anonymizer that can fit in your pocket could further enable identity thieves, hackers, and other online scalawags.\n\nWhile the creators of the project have yet to comment on these issues, the technologies used by the Anonabox are nothing new. It stands to reason that anyone with the technical prowess to hack or steal identities also probably already has TOR or an equivalent installed.\n\nFor now, though, the device is a hit with the Internet as a whole, from tinfoil-hatted paranoids to nerdy tinkerers. The Kickstarter campaign, which started on Sunday, has already raced past its $7,500 goal, hitting $270,000 at the time of writing.\n\nTop Reads From The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It\u2019s hard to understand why oppressive governments are even bothering to censor their", "title": "This Little Box Could Make Government Internet Censorship Irrelevant", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/14/Little-Box-Could-Make-Government-Internet-Censorship-Irrelevant", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/anonabox.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/14/Little-Box-Could-Make-Government-Internet-Censorship-Irrelevant", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/anonabox.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It\u2019s hard to understand why oppressive governments are even bothering to censor their", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2a2b\"", "article_summary": "Indeed, Tor has long been a requirement for those intrepid Internet explorers who decide to brave the deep web.\nFor now, though, the device is a hit with the Internet as a whole, from tinfoil-hatted paranoids to nerdy tinkerers.\nIt\u2019s hard to understand why oppressive governments are even bothering to censor their Internet anymore.\nWhile the creators of the project have yet to comment on these issues, the technologies used by the Anonabox are nothing new.\nThe Kickstarter campaign, which started on Sunday, has already raced past its $7,500 goal, hitting $270,000 at the time of writing."}
