The Broncos will play under cloudy skies Sunday, but snow isn’t expected to fall during the day, according to the National Weather Service in Boulder.

Temperatures could hit about 37 degrees in the metro area, said Robert Koopmeiners, an NWS forcaster.

Some fog in the metro area and on eastern plains should dissipate by noon, Koopmeiners said.

The high country is expected to get up to 3 inches of snow. Snow is expected to be light in most other mountain areas

“We have a winter storm advisory for snow all through today in the mountains until 5 p.m.,” Koopmeiners said.

Snow showers are expected in the northern half of Weld County, and into Morgan County, Koopmeiners said.
