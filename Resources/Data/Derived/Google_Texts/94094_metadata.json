The Ultimate Climb allowed them to go up three times. The Power Hour allowed climbers to go up as many times as possible in an hour.\n\nEveryone involved paid $25 for the chance to test their stamina and pledged to raise at least $100 for the Lung Association. Multiply that by the number of competitors and it comes to a pretty nice chunk of change.\n\n\"This is a fun and unique fundraising event,\" Miller said. \"It combines fitness, competition and an important cause.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Let Julie Andrews, or even Carrie Underwood, climb every mountain.
