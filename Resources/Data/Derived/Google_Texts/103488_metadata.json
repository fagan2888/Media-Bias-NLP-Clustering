He sent a stern message to attendees: Texas is \u201cunder assault.\u201d But, he added, the state has an opportunity to secure its destiny as a haven of freedom and liberty.\n\nPaxton said that Texas\u2019 model of low taxes and reliable regulation is threatened by liberal ideals.\n\n\u201cTexas is under assault,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re under assault economically\u2026We\u2019re [also] under assault politically. If [the left] can move this state into the Democrat column they will control the White House, they will control the Senate, and they will control the House.\u201d\n\nThe Attorney General candidate argued that Texas will continue to prosper, so long as the left is not successful in gaining control of the state.\n\n\u201cIn the midst of dire circumstances Texas has an opportunity,\u201d Paxton said. \u201cAn opportunity to secure our destiny just as our founding fathers did. History is on our side, history tells us that our ideas work, it tells us over and over that Obama\u2019s socialism will fail. But make no mistake, no other state is positioned to challenge Obama\u2019s vision than the state of Texas. It is up to me, it is up to each of you\u2013by the strength of our convictions and the actions\u2013that we preserve liberty\u2026I believe that God will bless Texas and as a result bless this entire nation.\u201d\n\nPaxton said that at an early age he was inspired by his father, and Air Force pilot, to get involved in politics.\n\n\u201cThat service and sacrifice I saw [in my father] over two decades, it instilled in me a desire,\u201d he said.\n\nThe state senator will face Democrat Sam Houston, a lawyer, in November.\n\nAfter securing the GOP nomination last month, Paxton said in a statement, \u201cI feel very strong about the upcoming November election and look forward to following one of the state\u2019s great attorneys general, Greg Abbott.\u201d\n\nPaxton was previously endorsed by Texas Senator Ted Cruz who said, \u201cKen Paxton is a tireless conservative warrior. Ken Paxton stands and fights, whether it\u2019s against Obamacare, whether it\u2019s fighting for Voter I.D., or whether it\u2019s fighting to defend our religious liberty. And I\u2019m proud to say Ken Paxton is my friend in fighting hard for the State of Texas.\u201d\n\nFollow Kristin Tate on Twitter @KristinBTate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ken Paxton: 'Texas is Under Assault'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Ken Paxton: 'Texas is Under Assault'", "title": "Ken Paxton: 'Texas is Under Assault' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-Texas/2014/06/04/Ken%20Paxton%20RPT%202014.PNG", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2014/06/07/tea-party-attorney-general-candidate-ken-paxton-texas-is-under-assault/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ken Paxton: 'Texas is Under Assault'", "title": "Ken Paxton: 'Texas is Under Assault' - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-Texas/2014/06/04/Ken%20Paxton%20RPT%202014.PNG", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Ted Cruz, Twitter, White House,Breitbart Texas,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart Texas", "tag": "White House", "published_time": "2014-06-07T08:28:00-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart Texas"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe068a\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERTea Party favorite Ken Paxton, a state senator and the Republican nominee for Texas Attorney General, addressed a crowd at the Texas GOP Convention on Friday.\nKen Paxton stands and fights, whether it\u2019s against Obamacare, whether it\u2019s fighting for Voter I.D., or whether it\u2019s fighting to defend our religious liberty.\nAnd I\u2019m proud to say Ken Paxton is my friend in fighting hard for the State of Texas.\u201dFollow Kristin Tate on Twitter @KristinBTate.\n\u201cIn the midst of dire circumstances Texas has an opportunity,\u201d Paxton said.\nPaxton said that Texas\u2019 model of low taxes and reliable regulation is threatened by liberal ideals."}
