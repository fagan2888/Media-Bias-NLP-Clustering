She has called for increasing the top capital gains tax and ending the multi-billion-dollar a year \u201ccarried interest\u201d tax loophole that has long benefitted wealthy private equity and hedge fund managers. But that\u2019s low-hanging Democratic fruit.\n\nSo it was interesting to hear her embrace the so-called \u201cBuffett rule\u201d on Wednesday during a joint campaign appearance in Omaha, Nebraska with the legendary financier Warren Buffett.\n\nRelated: How Ryan\u2019s Big Tax Deal Could Lead to Major Reform\n\nAt a time when candidates of both parties are focusing more on wage stagnation and income inequities between the very rich and the very poor, Clinton told a large audience of Nebraskans she intends to seek a fairer tax system if she is elected president.\n\nAt the core of the \u201cBuffett rule\u201d is the principle that no household making more than $1 million a year should pay a smaller share of income in taxes than middle-class families pay. The average tax rate paid by the highest-income Americans has plummeted to nearly the lowest rate in over 50 years, according to a 2012 White House study.\n\n\u201cThe wealthiest 1-in-1,000 taxpayers pay barely a quarter of their income in Federal income and payroll taxes today\u2014half of what they would have contributed in 1960,\u201d according to the report. Moreover, the top 400 richest Americans\u2014all making over $110 million at the time, had to pay only 18 percent of their income in income taxes in 2008.\n\n\u201cThe Buffett rule says that millionaires should pay at least 30 percent income tax rates instead of 10, 15, 20 \u2014 I want to go even further,\u201d Clinton said, according to The Hill. \u201cThere has been too much that has led to the wealthy getting wealthier.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Is Congress Giving Away $500 Billion in Unfunded Tax Breaks?\n\nWith her chief rival, Democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont forcing her further to the left on economic issues, the former secretary of state said, \"I want to be the president for the struggling, the striving and the successful, but right now, there has been too much that has led to the wealthy getting wealthier at the expense of hard-working families.\u201d\n\nBuffett, 85, the chair, CEO and top shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway, is considered one of the wealthiest men in the world. He inspired a slew of prominent Democrats, including President Obama and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts with his now famous observation that he paid a lower effective tax rate than his secretary because of how badly the federal tax code is tilted in the favor of wealthy Americans.\n\nIn 2011, Obama\u2019s advisers drafted a tax plan that would apply a minimum tax rate of 30 percent on individuals who were making more than a million dollars a year \u2013 a plan that would affect 0.3 percent of taxpayers. The idea never went anywhere. Last year, Warren reintroduced a bill inspired by the Buffett Rule called the \u201cFair Share Tax.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s proposed higher effective tax rate on millionaires would generate revenues to pay for a program permitting students to refinance their higher education loans at lower interest rates. Some have estimated that the \u201cBuffett rule\u201d could generate at least $36.7 billion a year in fresh revenue if it were embedded in the tax code.\n\nRelated: Why Congress Is Throwing in the Towel on Tax Reform\n\nEconomists have long been divided over the question of whether wealthier Americans are paying their \u201cfair share\u201d of taxes or whether they and their accountants are using the byzantine federal tax code to escape paying hundreds of billions of dollars in tax revenue.\n\nIn 2009, for instance, some 22,000 households earning more than $1 million a year paid less than 15 percent of their income in income taxes. At the same time, 1,470 of them managed to escape paying any federal income taxes on their vast incomes, according to Internal Revenue Service data.\n\nHowever, Kyle Pomerleau, the director of Federal Projects at the non-partisan Tax Foundation, argued in an analysis last year that \u201cOur progressive tax system taxes people at higher rates as they earn more.\u201d Citing a Joint Committee on Taxation study, Pomerleau said that those making $1 million or more pay an effective tax rate of 27 percent on their federal individual income tax.\n\nRelated: 6 Tips from Warren Buffett on What to Do During a Market\n\n\u201cAlthough not an effective tax rate of 30 percent, it is still higher than any other income group,\u201d he wrote. Even if one was to toss in the effect of payroll and excise taxes \u2013 which tend to hit lower income people harder than the wealthy \u2013 \u201cthe distribution is still very progressive.\u201d\n\nFinally, Pomerleau noted, high-income taxpayers pay both the highest effective federal tax rates and a disproportionately large share of overall federal income taxes. According to the most recent IRS data, the top 1 percent paid 35 percent of all income taxes in in 2011. That accounted for more than everyone else paid combined among the remaining 90 percent of taxpayers.\n\n\u201cWithout knowing too many details, it is hard to say if Clinton\u2019s proposal would have the exact same issues,\u201d Pomerleau said in an email message. \u201cHowever, I don't think another minimum tax is necessary. We already have the AMT (Alternative Minimum Tax). Even more, if policymakers believe the effective rates of the rich are too low, there are more straight forward ways to increase them, such as raising marginal rates on income or eliminating/capping itemized deductions.\u201d\n\nHere are two charts cited by Pomerleau:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "So far, we have seen little of Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Rodham Clin", "title": "Clinton Wants to Raise Taxes on the Rich", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/17/Clinton-Wants-Raise-Taxes-Rich", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/10232015_Hillary_Benghazi.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/17/Clinton-Wants-Raise-Taxes-Rich", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/10232015_Hillary_Benghazi.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "So far, we have seen little of Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Rodham Clin", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "In 2009, for instance, some 22,000 households earning more than $1 million a year paid less than 15 percent of their income in income taxes.\nAt the same time, 1,470 of them managed to escape paying any federal income taxes on their vast incomes, according to Internal Revenue Service data.\nAccording to the most recent IRS data, the top 1 percent paid 35 percent of all income taxes in in 2011.\nMoreover, the top 400 richest Americans\u2014all making over $110 million at the time, had to pay only 18 percent of their income in income taxes in 2008.\nThe average tax rate paid by the highest-income Americans has plummeted to nearly the lowest rate in over 50 years, according to a 2012 White House study."}
