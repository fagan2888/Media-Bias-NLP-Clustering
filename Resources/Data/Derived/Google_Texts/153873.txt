Shocking footage of a California cop repeatedly punching an unarmed woman in the head is going viral after a passing motorist recorded the incident on his cell phone.

The video shows the cop approaching the woman, who is visibly disturbed, grabbing her arm, and then throwing her to the ground, at which points he climbs on top of her and begins punching her in the head. A second officer then appears to help make the arrest.

“She took a left, and the cop, the CHP [California Highway Patrol] ran after her, grabbed her to try to subdue her, and then she you know, kind of tried to shove it off…Was she intoxicated? Was she mentally ill? Possibly,” the motorist, David Díaz, told NBC Los Angeles.

“She was screaming,” said a second witness, Daina Tate. “Two men were on her. They had her arms up. She couldn’t defend herself. She looked totally helpless and terrified.”
