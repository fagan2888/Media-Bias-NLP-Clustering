Frank Kovalchek, CC BY 2.0\n\nBeing kicked off a plane is normally the type of thing that happens to criminals or people discovered to have a highly contagious disease. But on Monday, Elizabeth Sedway, from California, says she felt like she was being treated as such, despite the fact she had cancer.\n\nSedway and her family were forced off an Alaska Airlines flight to San Jose from Hawaii on Monday after a flight attendant insisted Sedway have a doctor\u2019s note to fly. The incident began when Sedway was sitting in the handicap section of the airline\u2019s boarding area. An employee asked Sedway, who suffers from the blood cancer multiple myeloma and was wearing a surgical mask to protect herself from germs, if she needed anything, to which she answered \u201cno.\u201d When Sedway was asked a second time, she said that she \u201cmight need a bit of extra time to board,\u201d since she sometimes feels \u201cweak.\u201d\n\nThis interaction led to a \u201ccommunication breakdown,\u201d Alaska Airlines spokeswoman Bobbie Egan told NBC Bay Area. Once Sedway and her family had boarded the plane, a flight attendant told her she wouldn\u2019t be able to fly unless she had a doctor\u2019s note \u2014 the precautions were taken to ensure she didn\u2019t collapse while in the air. You can see video of the interaction here.\n\n\u201cIt was shocking. I mean I\u2019ve flown, we\u2019ve flown for five years with this diagnosis, and I felt humiliated,\u201d she told CBS San Francisco. She also said that she had exchanged emails with her oncologist before flying, and that he had cleared her for travel. The incident caused Sedway to miss her chemotherapy appointment on Tuesday.\n\nAside from an apology, the airline has also promised to refund the airfare for the family as well as reimburse any expenses.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "alaska, airlines, apologizes, after, forcing, woman, cancer, flight, not, having, doctors, note", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "After kicking a woman with multiple myeloma off her flight because she didn't have a doctor's note, Alaska Airlines has issued an apology.", "title": "Alaska Airlines Apologizes After Kicking Woman With Cancer Off Flight [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/alaska-airlines-apologizes-after-forcing-woman-cancer-flight-not-having-doctors-note-328608", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/04/08/alaska-airlines.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After kicking a woman with multiple myeloma off her flight because she didn't have a doctor's note, Alaska Airlines has issued an apology.", "title": "Alaska Airlines Apologizes After Kicking Woman With Cancer Off Flight [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/alaska-airlines-apologizes-after-forcing-woman-cancer-flight-not-having-doctors-note-328608", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/04/08/alaska-airlines.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/08/alaska-airlines.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-04-08T17:50:56-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-08T17:59:06-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "After kicking a woman with multiple myeloma off her flight because she didn't have a doctor's note, Alaska Airlines has issued an apology."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcd0d\"", "article_summary": "After kicking a woman with multiple myeloma off her flight because she didn't have a doctor's note, Alaska Airlines has issued an apology.\nSedway and her family were forced off an Alaska Airlines flight to San Jose from Hawaii on Monday after a flight attendant insisted Sedway have a doctor\u2019s note to fly.\nBut on Monday, Elizabeth Sedway, from California, says she felt like she was being treated as such, despite the fact she had cancer.\nThe incident began when Sedway was sitting in the handicap section of the airline\u2019s boarding area.\nAside from an apology, the airline has also promised to refund the airfare for the family as well as reimburse any expenses."}
