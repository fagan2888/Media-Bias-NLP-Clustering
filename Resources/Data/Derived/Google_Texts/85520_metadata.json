We hope that our legislators continue to hear our prayers and listen to their constituents, who overwhelmingly favor commonsense immigration reform,\" said Salguero in a statement.\n\nWallis said he believes that fear is one of the largest impediments keeping legislators from politically supporting immigration reform.\n\n\"I think its two kinds of fear,\" said Wallis. \"There's the short term political fear of losing their seats.\"\n\nThe long-term fear driving the inertia, Wallis believes, relates to the country's changing demographics.\n\n\"By 2050 most Americans will come from Africa, Latin America or Asia \u2026 which will mean we will not be a majority white culture. We will be a majority minority country. Many white people are afraid of losing their country and they don't want that to happen.\"\n\nWallis said that Christians played a critical role in alleviating the country's apprehension by demonstrating that \"the body of Christ is intrinsically multi-racial.\"\n\nWallis also refuted criticisms that had been levied at Evangelical leaders earlier this year for promoting a political position not held by their congregations, conceding that the criticism may have been valid three to five years ago, but no longer applied.\n\n\"If you took a vote of Evangelicals on immigration reform, we would pass it,\" he said.\n\nWallis encouraged Christians to pray with their representatives about the issue and consider fasting, adding that it was important that predominantly white constituencies voice these concerns to their representatives on behalf of minority immigrants living in the same community.\n\nHe also stressed that it was essential that church leadership articulate their church's position on immigration reform to their representatives.\n\n\"[We need to have] pastors calling representatives saying 'I'm from your district. We have a church of 5,000 people. We're watching [immigration reform] carefully,\" said Wallis.\n\nOther Christian leaders at the meeting were Hyepin Im, president and CEO of the California-based Korean Churches for Community Development, Eusebio Elizondo, auxiliary bishop for the Archdiocese of Seattle, Leith Anderson, president of the National Association of Evangelicals, Joel Hunter, a Florida senior pastor at Northland and an Obama advisor, and Mike McClenahan, a California senior pastor at Solana Beach Presbyterian Church.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and eight Evangelical and Christian leaders met in the Oval Office on Nov. 13 to discuss the faith community's role in passing immigration reform.", "Copyright": "2016 Christian Post", "Title": "Russell Moore, Jim Wallis and Other Christian Leaders Discuss Immigration Reform with President Obama", "og": {"site_name": "Christian Post", "description": "President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and eight Evangelical and Christian leaders met in the Oval Office on Nov. 13 to discuss the faith community's role in passing immigration reform.", "title": "Russell Moore, Jim Wallis and Other Christian Leaders Discuss Immigration Reform with President Obama", "url": "http://www.christianpost.com/news/russell-moore-jim-wallis-and-other-christian-leaders-discuss-immigration-reform-with-president-obama-108783/", "image": "http://images.christianpost.com/full/66689/president-barack-obama-and-vice-president-joe-biden-join-hands-during-a-prayer-at-the-end-of-an-immigration-reform-meeting-with-faith-leaders-in-the-oval-office-nov-13-2013.jpg", "author": "Morgan Lee", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ChristianPost", "image": "http://images.christianpost.com/full/66689/president-barack-obama-and-vice-president-joe-biden-join-hands-during-a-prayer-at-the-end-of-an-immigration-reform-meeting-with-faith-leaders-in-the-oval-office-nov-13-2013.jpg", "description": "President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and eight Evangelical and Christian leaders met in the Oval Office on Nov. 13 to discuss the faith community's role in passing immigration reform.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Russell Moore, Jim Wallis and Other Christian Leaders Discuss Immigration Reform with President Obama"}, "syndication-source": "http://www.christianpost.com/news/russell-moore-jim-wallis-and-other-christian-leaders-discuss-immigration-reform-with-president-obama-108783/", "robots": "index, follow", "bt": {"keywords": "Immigration&20Reform,Barack&20Obama,Evangelical,Jim&20Wallis,Russell&20Moore,christian&20news,christianity,evangelical", "pubDate": "2013-11-14T15:32:00-05:00", "modDate": "2013-11-14T15:32:00-05:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "29BD7F6D752EB52F5F8F8ACEF4AC6689", "fb": {"page_id": 41093998634, "app_id": 968308226558745}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "Googlebot-news": "index, follow", "Keywords": "Immigration Reform, Barack Obama, Evangelical, Jim Wallis, Russell Moore,christian news,christianity,evangelical", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd02b0\"", "article_summary": "\"It was a conversation with President Obama about immigration reform and how this has really united the faith community across our boundaries,\" Wallis told The Christian Post.\nHe also stressed that it was essential that church leadership articulate their church's position on immigration reform to their representatives.\n\"If you took a vote of Evangelicals on immigration reform, we would pass it,\" he said.\nWallis said he believes that fear is one of the largest impediments keeping legislators from politically supporting immigration reform.\nWe hope that our legislators continue to hear our prayers and listen to their constituents, who overwhelmingly favor commonsense immigration reform,\" said Salguero in a statement."}
