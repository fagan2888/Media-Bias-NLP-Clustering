The GOP had barely declared victory after its shellacking of Democrats on Tuesday before they started rolling out plans to melt the Earth.

It was already clear that a Republican victory would doom efforts to do something about climate change. After all, Oklahoma’s Jim Inhofe, a climate change denier, is expected to chair the Environment and Public Works Committee.

Moreover, the way the GOP won should have predicted that a victory would accelerate the burning of fossil fuel. After all, the oil magnate and climate change denying Koch brothers provided huge dark money backing for GOP candidates.

But in a press conference on Wednesday, Mitch McConnell — who will become majority leader in January — made it clear how central plans to burn more fossil fuels are to the Republicans. McConnell explicitly mentioned forcing the president to approve the Keystone pipeline. But he also envisioned something more. “We haven’t had an energy bill in seven years,” McConnell said, “we need to embrace the energy revolution that’s going on in our country, promote it.”

That might suggest McConnell envisions easing already inadequate rules on fracking. Coming from a coal-state senator, it also might mean efforts to make coal competitive again; in his presser, McConnell claimed Obama had launched a war on coal. Republicans have always wanted to open up the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge for drilling. And as David Dayen wrote in Salon earlier this week, Republicans may be disinclined to extend tax credits on solar panels (Dayen also predicted the Republicans would emphasize trade deals, which is another item McConnell confirmed he will do).
