You see, the announcement of a deal to reopen the federal government and avoid an imminent debt default means that Palin won\u2019t get the impeachment of President Obama that she was salivating for just two days ago.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been a good week for Palin.\n\nFirst she crashed this weekend\u2019s Tea Party rally protesting the GOP shutdown of the federal government, even though Palin and the Tea Party, and her co-crasher Ted Cruz were all in favor of the shutdown.\n\nThen some idiots with some confederate flags showed up to seal the deal as to how loony Palin\u2019s protest really was.\n\nThen the Tea Partyers start shouting racist slurs at the White House cops.\n\nAnd now Palin\u2019s secret plan to impeach the president has gone sadly awry.\n\nPalin thought she had it all planned out. Here she was on Facebook, just two days ago, explaining how no matter President Obama did, she\u2019d impeach him. Or at least she\u2019d Facebook him:\n\nPALIN: It\u2019s time for the president to be honest with the American people for a change. Defaulting on our national debt is an impeachable offense, and any attempt by President Obama to unilaterally raise the debt limit without Congress is also an impeachable offense.\n\nDid you catch that?\n\nIf the Republicans force the country into default, Obama gets impeached. And if the President finds a way to avoid default, he\u2019s impeached.\n\nIt\u2019s like arguing with a bratty ten year old who thinks they\u2019re the smartest kid in the world.\n\nFollow @aravosis", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two days ago, Sarah Palin announced a secret plan to impeach President Obama over the impending debt default.
