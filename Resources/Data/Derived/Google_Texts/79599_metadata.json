He signed to the Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 practice squad and was waived the following offseason.\n\nRoss joined the Washington Redskins and was waived again last August, then signed with the Chicago Bears and was promoted to the active roster. Ross played two games before he was released once again, doing the practice squad dance until he signed back with the Redskins\u2019 squad last December.\n\nOn Saturday, Ross experienced perhaps the highest of highs in his young career when he made the Redskins\u2019 53-man roster after an impressive preseason performance.\n\nRoss admitted he was relieved to make the team, but knowing the process all too well, the Arizona State product understands nothing is guaranteed.\n\n\u201cAll my hard work I put in, I felt like it all came together,\u201d Ross said Sunday at Redskins Park. \u201cIt felt good, like all the hard work I put in was worth it, but I can\u2019t sit back and relax because like I said, I\u2019ve been on the practice squad two years and being on the practice squad and seeing how it goes around, they bring people in every week to replace somebody.\n\n\u201cKnowing that just because you\u2019re on the team today doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re on the team tomorrow makes you want to work harder just to stay and keep your spot.\u201d\n\nRoss finished the preseason as the NFL\u2019s leading receiver, catching 25 passes for 266 yards and four touchdowns.\n\nEntering the preseason finale against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Ross was competing for a job as the team\u2019s sixth receiver. The Redskins were set with DeSean Jackson, Pierre Garcon, Ryan Grant, Andre Roberts and rookie Jamison Crowder.\n\nHardly five minutes into the game, Ross started to move the needle with a 19-yard punt return. That set the table for a performance that would have made it difficult for the Redskins to cut him. He finished the game with 10 catches for 103 yards and a touchdown.\n\nThough Ross\u2018 performance was inspiring, the Redskins were still faced with what appeared to be a difficult decision. With ultimately one receiver spot available, it would have been difficult to keep both Ross and Evan Spencer, the team\u2019s sixth-round draft pick out of Ohio State.\n\nSpencer had just two catches for 16 yards in the preseason, but the team was high on his potential. He sustained a concussion in the team\u2019s third preseason game against the Baltimore Ravens and missed the final preseason game, opening the door for Ross to make the team.\n\nSpencer, who was cut from the team\u2019s 53-man roster on Saturday and designated as injured, was not claimed Sunday. He reverted to injured reserve and can negotiate an injury settlement once he clears concussion protocol, which would open the door for him to sign with another team.\n\nIf Spencer was in fact healthy, it may have complicated the decision to keep Ross. Based on Ross\u2018 performance, it was nearly impossible for the team to cut him, as coach Jay Gruden acknowledged Sunday.\n\n\u201cYou talk about going out there and making plays, I\u2019d be lying to you if I had cut him,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cYou\u2019d say, \u2018What about this guy? This guy made all kinds of plays and you cut him. You\u2019re lying.\u2019 We talk about taking advantage of your opportunities, making plays and we\u2019re going to do what\u2019s right by you and the right thing was to keep him.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ross finished the preseason as the NFL's leading receiver to ensure his spot on the Redskins roster.
