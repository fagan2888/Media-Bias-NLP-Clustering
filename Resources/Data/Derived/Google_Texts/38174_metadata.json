Scott Walker: The New Republic writes about the first-term Republican in an article headlined: \u201cThe Unelectable Whiteness of Scott Walker. Credit: Associated Press\n\nAs one of the handful of people who have written the most about Gov. Scott Walker over the past four years, imagine my surprise when The New Republic advertised a new article promising to expose Walker's \"toxic world of racial politics.\" What new information could TNR have unearthed that would describe the \"poisonous, racially divided world\" that produced Walker's tenure as Wisconsin governor?\n\nAs it turns out, the article doesn't remotely live up to its click-baiting headline, \"The Unelectable Whiteness of Scott Walker.\" (Ann Althouse has been following the various incantations of the \"scurrilous\" article's headline, which at one point was \"Scott Walker is So Hot Right Now.\")\n\nThe first reason is self-evident: Walker doesn't seem to be all that \"unelectable,\" given that he has won two gubernatorial elections. And he is so toxically Caucasian that he was elected to the position of county executive three times in Milwaukee County, where two-thirds of all the state's African-Americans reside.\n\nAs I read through the article, I kept waiting for a single example of Walker's \"toxic racial politics\" and found exactly none. This is like going to a movie called \"Godzilla,\" only to find out that it's a Keira Knightley Victorian era period piece.\n\nTNR senior editor Alec MacGillis (who, in fairness, may not have written the ridiculous headline) offers the weakest of sauce as examples of Walker's virulent racism.\n\nFirst, he says that Walker went on host Mark Belling's radio talk show shortly after Belling crudely mocked African-American U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.). (Unmentioned is the parade of Democratic bright lights who have appeared on Madison area radio personality \"Sly\" Sylvester's show after he called former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice \"Aunt Jemima\" and former Secretary of State Colin Powell an \"Uncle Tom.\")\n\nMacGillis then recounts a number of facts already known to most Wisconsinites, proving he has a firm grasp of Google. Walker is a preacher's kid, who once had a mullet. One of his staffers when he was county executive said some racially insensitive things in some private emails that were recently made public. The Milwaukee area is extremely divided racially. Conservative radio is very popular in southeastern Wisconsin.\n\nIn fact, in focusing on the hyper-polarization of Milwaukee and its suburbs, MacGillis hurts his own argument. If Milwaukee is so stubbornly liberal, how did someone as toxically racist as Walker earn three terms as its county executive? (And, in fact, once beating African-American state Sen. Lena Taylor in the process.)\n\nIn describing Walker's early days in the Wisconsin Legislature, MacGillis casually mentions that \"Walker didn't really seem all that interested in making an impact in Madison \u2014 colleagues from both parties recall him as an amiable backbencher.\"\n\nThis isn't remotely true. In those days, Walker was universally seen as active and ambitious. (I was a legislative staffer at the time, and the joke was always that the most dangerous place in the Capitol was between Walker and a microphone.) Walker actually took a leading role in shepherding Gov. Tommy Thompson's enormous \"Truth in Sentencing\" laws through the Legislature in the late 1990s.\n\nHaving whiffed on every previous attempt to tie Walker to \"poisonous\" racial politics, MacGillis invokes some \"anti-Milwaukee\" (read: \"anti-minority\") legislation Walker has signed. MacGillis says Walker \"cut thousands of Milwaukee residents\" from the state's Medicaid rolls, without mentioning that many of them were supposed to be transferred to the federal Obamacare exchanges at the beginning of the year. (When Obamacare started to go belly up, Walker delayed the shift \u2014 and even now, thousands of more people in the state have health care than when Walker took over.)\n\nAs more anti-Milwaukee legislation, MacGillis cites the elimination of the city's residency law, which required city employees to live within Milwaukee's borders. But many of these city employees, including African-Americans, are no longer trapped in the city and can move to better lives and safer communities elsewhere; the move was actually supported by the same teachers unions that spent months rallying against Walker's union reforms.\n\nAnd, of course, the article cites the Walker-signed requirement that voters show photo identification at the polls, because it is \"long seen as an effort to limit minority access to the polls.\"\n\n\"Long seen\" by whom? Not by minorities, who routinely support a photo identification by a two-to-one margin.\n\nYou get the idea. Through the sheer force of 7,333 words, the article tries to tie together multiple tangential talking points to make it seem as though racism is somehow driving Walker's success.\n\nIn monster movies, directors have to make a decision as to when to finally reveal the monster. Audiences generally get at least a half hour of rustling trees and shaking water glasses before the monster finally bursts onto the screen.\n\nBut in MacGillis' article, though the trees rustle and the water ripples, the monster never appears.\n\nChristian Schneider is a Journal Sentinel columnist and blogger.
