They bust you by being grateful for the day while you are obsessed with how thin your lashes have become or how wide your bottom. They will shame you by being happy even though they have Lou Gehrig\u2019s Disease and shake you loose from your self-pity.\u201d\n\nLamott\u2019s hike in the Muir Woods with her friend Barbara, who is afflicted with the disease, is one of the stories she tells in \u201cSmall Victories.\u201d The book is a series of essays about triumphs and awakenings in her life, everything from falling off a ski lift to going on Match.com to find a boyfriend (which didn\u2019t work out, but she got a good story out of it).\n\nLamott is the best-selling author of quirky books about faith. Once an alcoholic and a drug addict, Lamott was unmarried, pregnant and about to get an abortion when she wandered into a church in California and found God. But she is not your average self-righteous, preachy born-again. Lamott is funny, witty and irreverent. She is also liberal and non-judgmental, which does not make her a favorite among conservative Christians. It does make her a favorite, however, among those who thinks God has a sense of humor.\n\nLamott\u2019s brand of faith is for those who are struggling with religion and haven\u2019t a clue what God wants them to do and be. She believes that \u201cGod answers prayers eventually \u2014 of course, it is the \u2018eventually\u2019 that throws one into despair,\u201d she writes.\n\nForgiveness is a theme of many of her essays. Forgiveness, she writes, \u201cis the hardest work we do.\u201d She has tips: When you begin learning forgiveness, it is not necessary to start with the Gestapo. And forgiving \u201cdoesn\u2019t necessarily mean you want to go on vacation together.\u201d But it\u2019s important, not just to the person you forgive but to you. \u201cNot forgiving is like drinking rat poison then waiting for the rat to die,\u201d she writes.\n\n\u201cSmall Victories\u201d is Lamott\u2019s seventh book on faith. She hit the best-seller list with her hilarious \u201cOperating Instructions,\u201d the story of her pregnancy and the first year of her son\u2019s life. He\u2019s now in his 20s. Then she went on to write \u201cBird by Bird,\u201d every writer\u2019s favorite book on writing.\n\nHer novels are less successful. But her books on faith are on the best-seller lists, and with good reason. Her basic message is love and forgiveness. \u201cJesus said, and this is not a direct quote, \u2018The point is not to hate and kill each other today, and if you can, to help the forgotten and powerless.'\u201d\n\nNot a bad message for any faith.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Anne Lamott shares triumps and awakenings in \u201cSmall Victories\u201d", "title": "Anne Lamott shares triumps and awakenings in \u201cSmall Victories\u201d", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/13/anne-lamott-shares-triumps-and-awakenings-in-small-victories/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-13T17:59:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-13T17:59:06+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Then she went on to write \u201cBird by Bird,\u201d every writer\u2019s favorite book on writing.\nAnne Lamott gets right to the point: If you\u2019re having a bad day, friends \u201cwill ruin everything for you.\n\u201cSmall Victories\u201d is Lamott\u2019s seventh book on faith.\nLamott is the best-selling author of quirky books about faith.\nShe believes that \u201cGod answers prayers eventually \u2014 of course, it is the \u2018eventually\u2019 that throws one into despair,\u201d she writes."}
