He was accused of breaking an oft-repeated promise that if you like your health coverage, you can keep it.\n\n\n\nAmeriHealth joins Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, the state\u2019s largest insurer, and Aetna, in deciding not to \u00adrenew health plans that don\u2019t comply with the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter much consideration about the impact on our members, we have decided to move forward with the suite of ACA-compliant health plans we have worked so diligently to create over the last several years,\u201d said Judith L. Roman, AmeriHealth New Jersey\u2019s president and chief executive officer, in a statement.\n\n\n\nThe company\u2019s new plans offer a variety of options at various price points, she said.\n\n\n\nAt renewal, customers will be given information about the new choices that are comparable to their previous benefit plans.\n\n\n\nThe standard individual and small-group plans in New Jersey have not previously included pediatric dental and vision care coverage, and sometimes provided coverage for prescription drugs and maternity care as separate riders. The 2014 plans must include all of these as part of the 10 essential health benefits.\n\n\n\nAt the end of September, AmeriHealth of New Jersey covered 92,400 people through 12,800 small-group contracts, and 9,183 people with individual coverage, according to state insurance department data.\n\n\n\nEmail: washburn@northjersey.com\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "AmeriHealth's decision will mean 100,000 more New Jerseyans will have to go shopping for health insurance because their policies do not meet the standards of the Affordable Care Act.", "copyright": "North Jersey Media Group Inc.", "author": "LINDY WASHBURN", "og": {"url": "http://www.northjersey.com/cm/2.1593/news/amerihealth-of-new-jersey-won-t-renew-100-000-health-policies-that-don-t-meet-new-standards-1.669495", "site_name": "NorthJersey.com", "image": "http://www.northjersey.com/designimages/NorthJerseyFacebook_377x196.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "AmeriHealth's decision will mean 100,000 more New Jerseyans will have to go shopping for health insurance because their policies do not meet the standards of the Affordable Care Act."}, "title": "AmeriHealth won't renew health policies in New Jersey", "robots": "noarchive,noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=446490632", "fb": {"admins": "100002050123125,739916158,1235266096", "app_id": 130358300392751}, "DC.creator": "LINDY WASHBURN", "msvalidate.01": "697A26605161B513EFE2AD6E581F4AA8", "google-site-verification": "swyvR_LXSGMOxOz1638gujs38OoVP3sZwJgdjySjnXM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes", "DC.title": "AmeriHealth won't renew health policies in New Jersey"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8525\"", "article_summary": "AmeriHealth of New Jersey, which covers more than 100,000 people in individual and small-group health plans, announced Tuesday that it will not renew 2013 health plans that do not comply with the new health care law next year.\nHe was accused of breaking an oft-repeated promise that if you like your health coverage, you can keep it.\nAmeriHealth joins Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, the state\u2019s largest insurer, and Aetna, in deciding not to \u00adrenew health plans that don\u2019t comply with the Affordable Care Act.\nThat brings the total of New Jersey residents with individual and small-group plans that can\u2019t be renewed next year to more than 680,000.\nAt the end of September, AmeriHealth of New Jersey covered 92,400 people through 12,800 small-group contracts, and 9,183 people with individual coverage, according to state insurance department data."}
