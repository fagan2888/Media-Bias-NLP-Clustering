And he is quick to concede the point.\n\nLigety became the first man to win three gold medals at the world championships since Jean-Claude Killy did it at the 1968 Grenoble Olympics. He won the super combined and the super-G, then captured the third gold in giant slalom, an event he has dominated the past five years.\n\nTalk about a hard act to follow.\n\n\u201cI think winning three gold medals at the Olympics is probably somewhat of an unrealistic expectation,\u201d Ligety said with a wry smile. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason it hasn\u2019t been done in (46) years. There\u2019s so many guys that are specialists, and in the sport of ski racing the best guy often doesn\u2019t win. You have to have a quiet nonchalance about how you\u2019re going to go about your races. It\u2019s not swimming, where if you\u2019re the best guy in the world, you\u2019re going to win most likely.\u201d\n\nWith giant slalom coming next week and the super-G on Sunday, Ligety makes his debut at these Games on Friday in the super combined, and he must be regarded as a medal contender. He finished first and second in two World Cup super combined races last month.\n\nHe won a gold medal in combined at the 2006 Turin Games, when combined consisted of a downhill run and two slalom runs. Now the super combined is a downhill with one slalom run.\n\n\u201cI want to be able to try to get on the podium or win,\u201d Ligety said of Friday\u2019s race. \u201cI think that\u2019s well within my grasp if I ski well. My downhill\u2019s gotten better all year long, I\u2019ve felt more and more comfortable, so hopefully (Friday) I can piece together a good run and then have a good run of slalom as well. Hopefully that equals something metallic around my neck.\u201d\n\nThe super combined pits racers better in downhill against racers who are better in slalom. The race can favor \u201cspeed\u201d racers such as Bode Miller or \u201ctechnical\u201d specialists like Ligety and Alexis Pinturault of France, depending on course difficulty and other factors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a challenging downhill for sure, which in some cases gives guys that have the ability to turn the ability to stay closer,\u201d Ligety said of the Sochi Olympic course. \u201cWe\u2019ll see. That\u2019s what is kind of cool about super combined. There\u2019s never really truly distinct favorites, just because somebody like myself or Pinturault can have really big swings in downhill ability. Guys like Bode can have big swings in slalom ability. That\u2019s what makes it cool.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Ted Ligety makes Sochi debut as a favorite Friday in super-combined", "title": "Ted Ligety makes Sochi debut as a favorite Friday in super-combined", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/13/ted-ligety-makes-sochi-debut-as-a-favorite-friday-in-super-combined/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140213_082132_ted-ligety.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140213_082132_ted-ligety.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-13T08:19:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T14:02:24+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb50b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI want to be able to try to get on the podium or win,\u201d Ligety said of Friday\u2019s race.\nThere\u2019s never really truly distinct favorites, just because somebody like myself or Pinturault can have really big swings in downhill ability.\nGuys like Bode can have big swings in slalom ability.\nHe finished first and second in two World Cup super combined races last month.\nThat\u2019s what is kind of cool about super combined."}
