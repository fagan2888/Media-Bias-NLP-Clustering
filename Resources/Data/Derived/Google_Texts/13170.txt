GLENDALE, Ariz. — Avalanche forward Alex Tanguay will miss his second consecutive game Tuesday night with a facial fracture. He participated in the morning skate at Gila River Arena but will not play against the Arizona Coyotes.

Gametracker: Colorado Avalanche vs. Arizona Coyotes

Avs coach Patrick Roy said Tanguay is still feeling pain on the side of his head and has had blurred vision. He will be the only scratch on the single-game trip, as Colorado left injured forward John Mitchell and goalie Semyon Varlamov back in Denver.

The Avs host the Chicago Blackhawks on Wednesday at the Pepsi Center.

Tanguay fractured his jaw on Thursday against the Washington Capitals, taking a shot off the face from Alex Ovechkin. Tanguay skated Tuesday morning on a line with center Nathan MacKinnon and left wing Gabe Landeskog, in place of Jarome Iginla, who did not enter the ice.

Roy said Iginla, 37, will continue to take morning skates off to preserve his body.

The other lines against Arizona will be Matt Duchene between Ryan O’Reilly (left) and Daniel Briere (right); center Ben Street with Max Talbot (left) and Tomas Vincour (right); and Marc-Andre Cliche in the middle with Paul Carey (left) and Cody McLeod (right).

Carey will be making his season debut.

The Avs are carrying just six defensemen and each will play against the Coyotes. Reto Berra will start in goal.
