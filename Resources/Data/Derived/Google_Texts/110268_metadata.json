Last time around, they called us in the morning. It will be interesting.\u201d\n\nIt is undoubtedly heartbreaking for the native of Bloomington, Minn., who has represented USA Hockey since age 16, beginning at the U.S. National Development Program in Ann Arbor. He is currently enjoying his best NHL season with the Avs.\n\nJohnson and Stastny both helped the Americans win the silver medal at the 2010 Vancouver Games, and many expected both to play in Sochi, Russia, during hockey competition Feb. 13-23.\n\nStastny and Johnson practiced Wednesday, and both said they would learn about the selections when they were announced after the game at Michigan Stadium. In 2010, they were told in advance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that it\u2019s almost over with,\u201d Stastny said after practice. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s in the back of your mind a little too much. Whatever happens, happens. It\u2019s out of our hands. If it turns out well, it will be another dream come true.\u201d\n\nStastny, 28, had three points (one goal) in six games at the 2010 Games and served as U.S. captain at the 2013 World Championship last spring during the Stanley Cup playoffs. He helped the Americans win the bronze medal \u2014 their first medal since 2004 \u2014 by leading the team with 15 points (seven goals) in 10 games. Stastny also represented the U.S. at the 2007 and 2012 World Championships.\n\nStastny was born in Quebec City but was raised in St. Louis. He holds dual citizenship.\n\nJohnson also played at the 2013 World Championship. He was passed over for younger defensemen John Carlson of the Washington Capitals, Justin Faulk of the Carolina Hurricanes, Cam Fowler of the Anaheim Ducks, Ryan McDonagh of the New York Rangers and Kevin Shattenkirk of the St. Louis Blues.\n\nShattenkirk was a first-round draft pick of the Avalanche who was in the big 2011 trade with St. Louis that brought Johnson to Colorado.\n\nJohnson was the NHL\u2019s No. 1 overall draft pick in 2006, selected by the Blues.\n\nHe has 17 points (six goals) in 39 games this season, with a plus-10 rating.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mchambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Paul Stastny selected to U.S. Olympic team, Colorado Avalanche\u2019s Erik Johnson snubbed", "title": "Paul Stastny selected to U.S. Olympic team, Colorado Avalanche\u2019s Erik Johnson snubbed", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/01/paul-stastny-selected-to-u-s-olympic-team-colorado-avalanches-erik-johnson-snubbed/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131210_092710_paul-stastny.jpg", "height": 466}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131210_092710_paul-stastny.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-01T16:39:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T23:56:40+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd28cb\"", "article_summary": "Shattenkirk was a first-round draft pick of the Avalanche who was in the big 2011 trade with St. Louis that brought Johnson to Colorado.\nStastny was born in Quebec City but was raised in St. Louis.\nStastny and Johnson practiced Wednesday, and both said they would learn about the selections when they were announced after the game at Michigan Stadium.\nJohnson and Stastny both helped the Americans win the silver medal at the 2010 Vancouver Games, and many expected both to play in Sochi, Russia, during hockey competition Feb. 13-23.\nHe helped the Americans win the bronze medal \u2014 their first medal since 2004 \u2014 by leading the team with 15 points (seven goals) in 10 games."}
