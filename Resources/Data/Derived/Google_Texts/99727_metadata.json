The desire to change one person has blinded some politicians and paralyzed their will of real changes,\u201d Yatsenyuk said during Sunday\u2019s address.\n\nFor weeks, Ukrainian media have been ripe with rumors of secret meetings among a group of key Ukrainian politicians called the \u201cstrategic seven,\u201d suggesting behind-the-scenes alliance-building to prevent early parliamentary elections in the event of Yatsenyuk\u2019s departure.\n\nOn Sunday, Yatsenyuk suggested parliament speaker Volodymyr Grossman\u2014an ally of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko\u2014as his potential successor. The move signals a political alliance that will likely generate enough support to create a coalition large enough to prevent early elections.\n\nIn a statement released on the Ukrainian president\u2019s website Sunday evening, Poroshenko pushed for the formation of a new coalition and the selection of a new prime minister within a week.\n\n\u201cI agree that the country can no longer put up with the absence of the authorities. That is why I expect the parliament to bring good news next week,\u201d Poroshenko said, according to the statement.\n\nPoroshenko stressed his desire to avoid early parliamentary elections, adding: \u201cAnother parliament will not be better. In this situation, we must ensure that the parliament fulfills its promises made during the signature of the coalition agreement and finishes the process of reforms.\u201d\n\nU.S. Vice President Joe Biden called Yatsenyuk on Sunday, thanking him for his service to Ukraine. Biden pushed for Ukraine to quickly form a new cabinet \u201ccommitted to implementing needed reforms, in particular those recommended by the International Monetary Fund and European Union,\u201d according to a readout of the conversation the U.S. Embassy to Ukraine emailed to journalists on Sunday.\n\nBusiness as Usual\n\nUkrainians\u2019 confidence in the country\u2019s post-revolution government is in free-fall.\n\n\u201cIn a lot of government institutions, they only changed the head after the revolution. Everything else is the same from before,\u201d said Bogdan Logvynenko, 27, a Ukrainian journalist. \u201cNow we\u2019re asking, \u2018How do you change the system?\u2019\u201d\n\nRecent polls indicate that Ukrainians have less confidence in their government now than they did prior to the 2014 revolution.\n\nAccording to a Gallup poll released in December 2015, 17 percent of Ukrainians approved of Poroshenko\u2019s job performance, and 8 percent were confident in Ukraine\u2019s national government. Only 5 percent of Ukrainians thought the government was doing enough to fight corruption, according to the poll.\n\nDutch voters rejected a trade pact between the EU and Ukraine last Wednesday, adding to the sentiment among many Ukrainians that Kyiv was not doing enough to represent the country\u2019s interests abroad.\n\nYatsenyuk\u2019s announced resignation takes some political pressure off Poroshenko, who is under scrutiny for his offshore bank accounts, which the Panama Papers revealed last week.\n\nPoroshenko pledged to sell his chocolate company, Roshen, after he took office in 2014. He claimed to have transferred his assets to a blind trust, but the Panama papers revealed they went to a holding company in the British Virgin Islands.\n\nPoroshenko said advisers control his assets without his oversight, and Ukraine\u2019s chief prosecutor said Poroshenko had not committed a crime.\n\nYet Poroshenko\u2019s finances sparked a media firestorm in Ukraine. Some claim that the president\u2019s dealings were designed to skirt tax rules, highlighting a pattern of corruption and shady dealings among Ukraine\u2019s leaders that reflects business as usual during the past 25 years of post-Soviet independence.\n\nAccording to an April 8 editorial in the English-language Kyiv Post: \u201cThe nearly 25 years of tax dodging and misspent government budgets show every day in shortened lives, bad education, poor health care, dilapidated buildings, potholed streets and myriad other problems that Ukraine should not tolerate.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cWe cannot allow destabilization of the executive branch during a war.\"", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cWe cannot allow destabilization of the executive branch during a war.\"", "title": "Ukraine's Prime Minister Calls It Quits, Pressure Mounts to Form New Coalition", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/dpaphotostwo532931.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-11T12:52:29+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Yo1jVT"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cWe cannot allow destabilization of the executive branch during a war.\"", "title": "Ukraine's Prime Minister Calls It Quits, Pressure Mounts to Form New Coalition", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/dpaphotostwo532931.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "europe", "published_time": "2016-04-10T18:46:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-11T12:52:29+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Arseniy Yatsenyuk, ukraine, russia, vladimir putin, kyiv post, Petro Poroshenko"}, "article_summary": "Yatsenyuk took over as prime minister in February 2014, after Ukraine\u2019s Maidan revolution ousted pro-Russian former president, Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia.\nKYIV, Ukraine\u2014In a televised address Sunday, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk announced he would step down Tuesday, marking the end of a two-month-long political crisis.\nOn Sunday, Yatsenyuk suggested parliament speaker Volodymyr Grossman\u2014an ally of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko\u2014as his potential successor.\nPoroshenko said advisers control his assets without his oversight, and Ukraine\u2019s chief prosecutor said Poroshenko had not committed a crime.\nThe move signals a political alliance that will likely generate enough support to create a coalition large enough to prevent early elections."}
