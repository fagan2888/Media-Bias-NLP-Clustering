Illinois lawmaker: State-owned vehicles should come off road

hello

FORSYTH, Ill. -- A state lawmaker says Illinois should pull state-owned vehicles off the road during its budget stalemate unless money is appropriated to self-insure them.

Republican state Rep. Bill Mitchell of Forysth says one of his constituents was involved in a collision with a state-owned automobile but hasn't been able to get paid for thousands of dollars in damage.

Mitchell tells The News-Gazette in Champaign (http://bit.ly/1SvdFXS ) that "in essence we're driving uninsured cars" when Illinois requires motorists to have insurance.

He says no money has been appropriated to pay settlements for vehicle repairs or replacements during the state budget deadlock between Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and the Democratic-controlled Legislature.

Department of Central Management Services spokeswoman Meredith Krantz estimates some 225 claims worth about $615,000 are on hold until the Legislature releases funds.
