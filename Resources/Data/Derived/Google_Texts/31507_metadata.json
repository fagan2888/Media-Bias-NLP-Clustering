Officials at IU Health attribute the organization's success to three key lessons they learned while trying to improve the process:\n\nInvolve various disciplines: IU Health found that a focus on single provider types such as nurses or physicians did not do the trick. Instead, officials write they got their best results by including multiple disciplines in the process, such as enlisting therapists to improve patient education and transition continuity.\n\nMake sure the message is consistent: Similarly, they say it's important to ensure that all providers involved in care transitions understand their respective roles and keep the message consistent. \"This step provides continuity within the team and between team members, patients, and families as everyone is more likely to speak the same language and interpret information in the same way,\" they write.\n\nCollect and measure data: IU Health stepped up its measurement tracking as well as the specific metrics collected as clinicians came to better understand processes. Without baseline data, the authors say, officials would have been unable to assess whether an improvement in a process was actually making a quantifiable difference to outcomes or whether it needed to be further fine-tuned.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the Medscape article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHow multidisciplinary efforts lead to better outcomes, lower costs\n\nInterprofessional care model shows promise for readmission reduction, ER use\n\nQuest for healthcare 'measures that matter' raises its own issues", "article_metadata": {"description": "Although there is no cookie-cutter approach to\u00a0care coordination, one hospital's\u00a0strategy has proven to be an effect model for patient care transitions,\u00a0according to\u00a0Medscape.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Although there is no cookie-cutter approach to\u00a0care coordination, one hospital's\u00a0strategy has proven to be an effect model for patient care transitions,\u00a0according to\u00a0Medscape.", "title": "3 lessons to improve patient care transitions", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/3-lessons-improve-patient-care-transitions/2016-04-21", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Coordination,Care Delivery,care transitions,data collection,Indiana University Health,Indiana University Health North Hospital,interprofessional healthcare,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "Although there is no cookie-cutter approach to care coordination, one hospital's strategy has proven to be an effect model for patient care transitions, according to Medscape.\nIndiana University Health North Hospital (IU Health) is among the top performers for care transitions based on Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems data.\nMake sure the message is consistent: Similarly, they say it's important to ensure that all providers involved in care transitions understand their respective roles and keep the message consistent.\nOfficials at IU Health attribute the organization's success to three key lessons they learned while trying to improve the process:Involve various disciplines: IU Health found that a focus on single provider types such as nurses or physicians did not do the trick.\nCollect and measure data: IU Health stepped up its measurement tracking as well as the specific metrics collected as clinicians came to better understand processes."}
