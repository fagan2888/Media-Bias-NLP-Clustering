Of the 14 House members, only Reps. Jody Hice, R-Monroe, and Hank Johnson, D-Lithonia, voted no. Both senators also voted yes.\n\nAll of them had threatened to line up against it because of a harmless sounding paragraph inserted by Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., that could have upset the balance of the tri-state water wars. But leadership yanked the paragraph, and Georgia responded with near-unanimous backing.\n\n\u201cThey stuck their neck out for us,\u201d said Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., of congressional leaders. \u201cBeing a successful senator and a successful member of Congress, it\u2019s all about reciprocity and relationships. \u2026 I think Georgia flexed its muscle over good relationships.\u201d\n\nSaid Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., of Thursday\u2019s frenzy:\n\n\u201cThat was something that we focused on once we became aware of it. We said: \u2018You know what, it shouldn\u2019t be in the bill, and we should fix it.\u2019 And we got that done and the Georgia delegation was strongly supportive of the bill because it fixed that problem that would have been devastating to Georgia and shouldn\u2019t have been in the bill. And we took it out.\u201d\n\nConservative critics attacked the bill for a variety of shortcomings, from not blocking refugees from Syria or allowing the Environmental Protection Agency to implement a new water regulation unpopular with farmers. Hice said his no vote had to do mostly with refugees.\n\nBut there were under the radar conservative wins, said Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, R-Coweta County:\n\n\u201cI know why they\u2019re upset. I\u2019m upset. But two years ago we were getting reamed because we were not stopping Obamacare \u2013 reamed. So now we finally get the insurance corridors gone, which is going to help dismantle it. \u201cThe device tax [delayed] for a couple of years, the Cadillac tax [delayed], so all these funders are going. Two years ago if we had done this, people would have been having parades for us, hugging our necks. \u201cAnd so they just want things instantly. And I understand that. Look, I would love instant things too, but this institution moves very slow. And when you\u2019re negotiating with Harry Reid and Obama, they\u2019ve got two of the three hands.\u201d\n\nSen. David Perdue \u2013like most of Georgia\u2019s House members \u2014 voted against the fall budget and debt ceiling deal that set these spending levels and set the stage for the omnibus spending bill. Perdue said he came around to yes Friday because several parochial priorities were protected, from the J-STARS aircraft at Warner Robins to a USDA poultry lab in Athens.\n\n\u201cBut the big thing,\u201d Perdue said, \u201cwas the water rights of the people of Georgia are protected.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Political Insider blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2015/12/18/after-water-fix-congress-clears-1-1-trillion-spending-bill-with-flood-of-georgia-support/", "image": "https://cmgajcpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/paul-ryan-hal-rogers.jpg?w=640", "type": "article", "description": "Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, R-Wis., left, and Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Ky., return to Ryan's office after passing the omnibus bill, at the Capitol in Washington, Friday, Dec. 18, 2015.
