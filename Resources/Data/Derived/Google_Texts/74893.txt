The White House issued a veto threat Wednesday for the Senate’s energy and water development appropriations bill if certain provisions that go beyond funding legislation are included.

In a statement of administration policy, the Office of Management and Budget said the Obama administration “strongly objects to the inclusion of problematic ideological provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.” OMB said final legislation must be consistent with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, an agreement established by the president and congressional leaders that helped to reverse certain sequestration cuts scheduled for fiscal year 2017.

The OMB statement also offered views on the measure, including insight that funding for the Army Corps of Engineers beyond the fiscal year 2017 request would not yield high investment returns for Americans and the bill underfunds Mission Innovation, an initiative rolled out by the U.S. and 19 other countries during the Paris climate talks to boost clean energy research-and-development.

The measure is currently being considered on the Senate floor.
