His message caught his eye and Brown was welcomed to meet and introduce the President Thursday in Milwaukee.\n\n\u201c(I want) to present to you, the man that saved my life, and the President of this great United States of America, Barack Obama,\u201d Brown said as he introduced Obama.\n\nBrown\u2019s message to the President was simple.\n\n\u201cI wanted to thank President Obama for saving my life for the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Brown said.\n\nBrown has an autoimmune disease that, without the Affordable Care Act, could have killed him; since the inception of the Affordable Care Act, he's been able to afford the medicine and surgeries to help cure the disease.\n\nAnd when asked if he got an ultimatum from a doctor, Brown said he didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cNot this long to live, however, the last time that I was in the hospital, it was pretty serious and grave,\u201d Brown said.\n\nBrown was able to get health insurance and have surgery to help cure the disease.\n\n\u201cI am in the process of recovering, of healing, and hopefully returning to a normalcy in life; something that has been lacking for a very long time,\u201d Brown said.\n\nAccording to Brown, the meeting was \u201cother worldly.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019The opportunity of a lifetime\u2019 is the first phrase that would come to mind,\u201d Brown exclaimed.\n\nEau Claire Republican Chair, Mike Conlin, says some people are no longer alive and some people are alive because of the Affordable Care Act, but the price of healthcare hasn\u2019t changed.\n\n\u201cIt did nothing to address these causes for the high prices for healthcare in America; all it did was change the insurance rules,\u201d Conlin said.\n\nBrown came to Eau Claire tonight for a live interview on the show \u201cAll In with Chris Hayes\u201d on MSNBC. Brown said he will remain a Republican, but his meeting with the President is something he\u2019ll never forget.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "A Central Wisconsin man got to do something most never get the chance to do in a lifetime; he got the opportunity to introduce the President of the United States.", "language": "english", "author": "Neil Hebert", "og": {"description": "A Central Wisconsin man got to do something most never get the chance to do in a lifetime; he got the opportunity to introduce the President of the United States.", "title": "Central Wisconsin Republican man introduces and meets Obama", "url": "http://www.weau.com/home/headlines/Central-Wisconsin-Republican-man-introduces-and-meets-Obama-371132731.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/E00/232/E00232EED8C54EC5B4A5E53EBD7920C1", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/028/11F/02811F2E2F0448B6A8796C68675A7951.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.weau.com", "description": "A Central Wisconsin man got to do something most never get the chance to do in a lifetime; he got the opportunity to introduce the President of the United States.", "creator": "@weau13news", "url": "http://www.weau.com/home/headlines/Central-Wisconsin-Republican-man-introduces-and-meets-Obama-371132731.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/10PM+MONITOR1.jpg", "title": "Central Wisconsin Republican man introduces and meets Obama", "site": "@weau13news", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Central Wisconsin Republican man introduces and meets Obama", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "XOlDnT88nYfAApmBC8lwbpWN4wAY0URAWE7v44TsGWU", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Central Wisconsin Republican man introduces"}, "article_summary": "Brent Brown of Mosinee, a self-proclaimed republican, wrote a letter to president Obama thinking he wouldn\u2019t even open it.\n\u201cI wanted to thank President Obama for saving my life for the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Brown said.\n\u201c(I want) to present to you, the man that saved my life, and the President of this great United States of America, Barack Obama,\u201d Brown said as he introduced Obama.\nBrown has an autoimmune disease that, without the Affordable Care Act, could have killed him; since the inception of the Affordable Care Act, he's been able to afford the medicine and surgeries to help cure the disease.\nEau Claire Republican Chair, Mike Conlin, says some people are no longer alive and some people are alive because of the Affordable Care Act, but the price of healthcare hasn\u2019t changed."}
