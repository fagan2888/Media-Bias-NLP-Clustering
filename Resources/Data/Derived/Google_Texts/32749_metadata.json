We would do, at pretty much every event, a press gaggle \u2014by the way, a lot of other candidates don\u2019t do press gaggles. I take questions all the time. Half to two thirds of the questions from the reporters would be about Donald Trump and the latest attack, the latest Tweet. When you go into the town hall, one county, 7,000 people, in one county we had 700 people. 10% of the county came out. Another town with 600 people, 150 came \u2013\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cBut here\u2019s my point, Howie. When we do town halls and actual voters would ask questions, nobody would ask about the silly birther attack nobody would ask about Donald Trump. They ask about the real problems facing this country. How do we defeat ISIS? How do we stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons? How do we protect our Second Amendment or religious liberty? How do we get more jobs?\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cruz: No Actual Voters Ask About the 'Silly Birther Attack'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Cruz: No Actual Voters Ask About the 'Silly Birther Attack'", "title": "Cruz: No Actual Voters Ask About the 'Silly Birther Attack' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/01/cruz-2.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/01/24/cruz-2/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cruz: No Actual Voters Ask About the 'Silly Birther Attack'", "creator": "@pamkeyNEN", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/01/cruz-2.jpg", "title": "Cruz: No Actual Voters Ask About the 'Silly Birther Attack' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Cruz: No Actual Voters Ask About the Silly Birther Attack", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Ted Cruz", "published_time": "2016-01-24T12:30:34-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "When we do town halls and actual voters would ask questions, nobody would ask about the silly birther attack nobody would ask about Donald Trump.\nHalf to two thirds of the questions from the reporters would be about Donald Trump and the latest attack, the latest Tweet.\n10% of the county came out.\nWhen you go into the town hall, one county, 7,000 people, in one county we had 700 people.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSunday on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cMediaBuzz,\u201d while discussing the controversy over if his birth in Canada to an American citizen mother causes him to be not eligible to run for president of the United States, Republican presidential candidate Sen.
