Former Democratic Rep. Robert Wexler (D., Fla.) has been accused of “dictator schilling” following a recent stay in Kazakhstan where he served as an election observer and attracted criticism for declaring the dictatorship’s vote “impressive.”

Wexler came under fire in a recently Daily Beast article for traveling to Kazakhstan in a trip that was partly paid for by the country’s hardline government.

“Wexler recently returned from Kazakhstan, where he served as a self-described ‘independent’ monitor observing the country’s presidential election last month,” the Daily Beast reported. “Wexler told me that the costs of his trip were split between the think tank he runs—the S. Daniel Abraham Center for Peace—and the Kazakh government (a morsel that might complicate his ‘independence’).”

Kazakhstan’s long reigning dictator, President Nursultan Nazarbayev, won the election with nearly 98 percent of the vote. Despite this outcome, Wexler praised the elections.

“Clearly, an incumbent president that gets 97.5 percent of the vote, most Americans—myself included—would shrug and say that’s not a contest,” Wexler told the Daily Beast. “And that’s kind of the way I went into it. But what’s clear is that Kazakhstan is in a special place in terms of its development as a country.”
