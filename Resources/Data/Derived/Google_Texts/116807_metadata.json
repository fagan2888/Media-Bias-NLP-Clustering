There\u2019s no question about it,\u201d bureau Superintendent Eric Cioppa said about the report, though he noted that the \u201cuncertainty and variability\u201d of claims can change an insurer\u2019s financial performance dramatically from month to month. \u201cIt\u2019s so difficult to predict.\u201d\n\nCommunity Health has more than 84,000 policyholders in Maine and New Hampshire. It is one of about two dozen insurance cooperatives nationwide to start up under the Affordable Care Act. They were intended to take a slice of the insurance markets created by the act and provide competition to for-profit insurers.\n\nHowever, many cooperatives underestimated the pent-up demand for medical services among newly insured and thus set their rates too low, Cioppa said. To date, about half of the initial crop of cooperatives has folded.\n\nHe said the cooperative plans to request a rate increase this summer for 2017 that would help offset the risk of future losses from another unexpected spike in claims.\n\nCommunity Health reported cash investments of $75.2 million at the end of February, down slightly from $76.4 million two months earlier. Its total membership as of Feb. 29 was 1.2 percent lower than projected.\n\nCommunity Health CEO Kevin Lewis said the two consecutive months of improvement to the cooperative\u2019s bottom line are a testament to its wide-ranging efforts to reduce costs and boost efficiencies.\n\n\u201cWe continue to maximize every premium dollar,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cWe\u2019re extremely bullish about 2016 and beyond.\u201d\n\nCommunity Health was the only cooperative in the nation to generate a cash surplus in 2014, its first year of operation. But a year later, it posted the $31 million loss for 2015 and announced it would set aside $43 million in reserves to cover potential losses this year.\n\nThe magnitude of the nonprofit\u2019s losses led to a decision to stop individual enrollments of new customers in December, weeks before the end of the enrollment period under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCommunity Health also cut $11 million in administrative costs at the end of 2015, although Lewis has declined to detail all of the specific steps taken.\n\nLewis acknowledged that two months of better-than-expected performance do not guarantee the cooperative will avoid financial trouble in the future if the cost of claims rises unexpectedly.\n\n\u201cCertainly, this (industry) isn\u2019t for the faint of heart,\u201d he said.\n\nA follow-up report will be issued by the insurance bureau in early May that covers the co-op\u2019s March performance, followed by similar monthly reports throughout the year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Still, the state's top insurance regulator said it is too early to tell whether losses will return.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Still, the state's top insurance regulator said it is too early to tell whether losses will return.", "title": "Community Health Options' finances improving - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PHnewFBlogo.png", "updated_time": "2016-04-04T21:09:08-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2016/04/04/community-health-options-finances-improving/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Still, the state's top insurance regulator said it is too early to tell whether losses will return.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PHnewFBlogo.png", "title": "Community Health Options' finances improving - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Business", "published_time": "2016-04-04T18:46:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-04T21:09:08-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1dc1\"", "article_summary": "It is one of about two dozen insurance cooperatives nationwide to start up under the Affordable Care Act.\nLewiston-based health insurance cooperative Community Health Options has experienced two consecutive months of solid financial performance following a $31 million loss in 2015, according to a report issued Monday.\nCommunity Health reported cash investments of $75.2 million at the end of February, down slightly from $76.4 million two months earlier.\nA follow-up report will be issued by the insurance bureau in early May that covers the co-op\u2019s March performance, followed by similar monthly reports throughout the year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so difficult to predict.\u201dCommunity Health has more than 84,000 policyholders in Maine and New Hampshire."}
