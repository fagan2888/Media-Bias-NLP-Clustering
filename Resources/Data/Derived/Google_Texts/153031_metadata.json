(AP) \u2014 Authorities have ordered swamp boat tour operators in the South Louisiana community of Jefferson Parish to stop feeding alligators after video of a tour guide doing so went viral.\n\nThere is no Louisiana law prohibiting luring and feeding of alligators, but it\u2019s against local law in Jefferson Parish, where a tourist captured video of an Airboat Adventures tour guide swimming with and feeding two alligators.\n\nAt one point the video captures the guide putting a marshmallow in his mouth and letting an alligator snatch it away.\n\nSheriff\u2019s spokesman Col. John Fortunato said Thursday his office has begun an investigation and is working closely with Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries. Fortunato says swamp tour companies were ordered to cease any feeding of the gators.\n\nNo charges had been filed as of Thursday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "La. tour operators ordered to stop feeding gators", "title": "La. tour operators ordered to stop feeding gators", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "La. tour operators ordered to stop feeding gators", "title": "La. tour operators ordered to stop feeding gators", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/12/la_tour_operators_ordered_to_stop_feeding_gators/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/feeding-alligators.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "La. tour operators ordered to stop feeding gators", "title": "La. tour operators ordered to stop feeding gators", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/feeding-alligators.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Stacey Plaisance", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "(AP) \u2014 Authorities have ordered swamp boat tour operators in the South Louisiana community of Jefferson Parish to stop feeding alligators after video of a tour guide doing so went viral.\nFortunato says swamp tour companies were ordered to cease any feeding of the gators.\nThere is no Louisiana law prohibiting luring and feeding of alligators, but it\u2019s against local law in Jefferson Parish, where a tourist captured video of an Airboat Adventures tour guide swimming with and feeding two alligators.\nAt one point the video captures the guide putting a marshmallow in his mouth and letting an alligator snatch it away.\nSheriff\u2019s spokesman Col.
