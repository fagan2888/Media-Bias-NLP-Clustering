A employee at a northwest Wichita department store received a dose of pepper spray to the face Saturday while trying to apprehend a suspected shoplifter.

Wichita Police said the call came in at just before 6 p.m. from the Target in the 2700 block of N Maize Rd.

The 24-year-old employee told officers she tried to stop a middle-aged woman from exiting the store without paying for a pair of televisions. When she got close the woman, the suspect shot her with the spray, then fled in tan colored sedan, possibly a Cadillac.

The suspect is described as a white female in her mid-40s with dark hair, 5-foot-4 and about 250 pounds.

The victim refused medical treatment for minor injuries.
