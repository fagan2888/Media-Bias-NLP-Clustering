On Sunday’s Meet the Press, NBC’s Chuck Todd sits down for an exclusive interview with Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, an outspoken opponent of the Affordable Care Act and a potential Republican candidate for president in 2016.

Just one day after open enrollment begins for the second time under the health care law, we’ll discuss his decision not to expand Medicaid in the state. Plus, we’ll ask the governor about the politics of the Keystone XL pipeline and about the steps President Barack Obama will reportedly take to allow millions of undocumented immigrants to stay in the United States.

And, of course, we’ll ask about his 2016 ambitions. All that and more, this Sunday on Meet the Press.
