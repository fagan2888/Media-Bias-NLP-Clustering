A former city policy advisor, Runner is an advocate of pragmatic government innovation that cuts through ideological divisions. SHARE\n\nBy\n\nToday's Sunday Driver is a true entrepreneur with a knack for baking and selling pies \u2013 pecan, key-lime, sweet potato and more. But he says that Purple Wisconsin readers should start by casting a vote for a slice of Purple Monster. He's a business owner. A community leader. An involved father. A Cub Scout den leader. And an engaged citizen. He's Johnathan Dye.\n\nYou own a small business in Milwaukee, Mr. Dye's Pies. Tell us about it and how you got started.\n\nI bake and sell the best sweet potato pie on Earth. I was five or six years old, and my grandmother, Virginia Herndon, did not kick me out of the kitchen! It was under her wing that I developed a passion for cooking. None of the things I do today are her recipes, but they are full of her influence for sure. I am grateful for that. I'm also grateful to Jimmie Jackson of the Jackson Grill who has been instrumental.\n\n\n\nCurrently, slices of pie can be purchased at several places, such as Double B's Bar B Que on 74th and Greenfield in West Allis; Loucci's NY Pizza on Lisbon and North; the Hawley road Mobil on Vliet and Hawley; as well as Ashley's Bar B Que on 14th and Center, and Ashley's Que on 2nd and National. Also, customers call in or inbox me on Facebook with whole-pie orders. These are all made and delivered fresh after I get the order. Calling a day in advance usually works best. I am a one-man show most of time, so advance notice helps.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore information and fun stuff can be found on Facebook at www.facebook.com/dyespies. Including an upcoming fundraiser for the American Lung Association at Double B's on Thursday night, May 15, and I will be giving away a few free pies when we get to 3,000 Facebook fans soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm thankful for all the support, business and encouragement that I get from the community. As a proud Milwaukee resident, this is as warming as it is humbling. As I work to build a strong brand for Mr. Dye's Pies, my customers and supporters have been marvelous.\n\nPoliticians talk a lot about \"small business owners\" and what government should or shouldn't do to help more of them flourish. What's your take on that? Can government help small businesses succeed? I think that more can be done to illuminate the resources that are currently available. In particular the work that Deshea Agee and Alderwoman Milele Coggs have done with creating their MKE Business Now Entrepreneurship Summit \u2013 it\u2019s exactly what we need more of. A 2013 budget amendment was co-sponsored by County Supervisor Russell Stamper II that set aside $100,000 for micro loans for small businesses. That\u2019s another good way government can help.\n\nIn general, any smart government will be in the business of encouraging small business. Tax breaks that are often offered to large companies should also be given to mid-size and small businesses. We know small businesses are responsible for 55 percent of all jobs and 66 percent of new jobs since the 1970s. I think our tax code and government loan subsidies should reflect this. All that said, I do believe the best way government can help is by being aware of when it's in the way. This blog is part of the Purple Wisconsin project, which is designed to stimulate political discourse. I suppose pies are non-partisan. Governor Walker is very red, and spring has brought blue skies. But I do have a pie that is purple! The Purple Monster is my trademark sweet potato pie. It has two special ingredients that turn the pie purple and give it a more sophisticated taste! Some say it tastes just like my classic sweet potato pie. Others can discern the difference and swear by it. Are there any elected officials \u2013 past or present \u2013 whom you admire? Yes, Benjamin Franklin's example in the 1700's always comes to mind. Franklin was successful and worked hard to contribute to society before he ever held public office. Again and again, he got things done. He started the first fire department and first public library. He was a Pennsylvania University founder and was ahead of his time on human rights. Franklin never applied for a patent, because he wanted his ideas to be put to use for the betterment of society. I think it was this kind of giving that allowed him to get so much done. Everyone knew what he stood for, and that his heart was in the right place. It was even his Idea for the colonies (states) to unite.\n\nYou're also active in your son's school, and you're a Cub Scout den leader. Any advice to those of us who are trying to find the right work-life balance? The key is to find ways to contribute that work for you. Your approach does not have to look like mine. Your efforts do not have to be similar to anyone else's. Figure out what you can do and what works for you. Then, most importantly, you need to get started \u2013 the sooner the better. We are tempted to wait until we are accomplished and successful, but those are not pre-requisites for taking action. It\u2019s important to get started where you are and help others along the journey.\n\nEditor's Note: Purple Wisconsin is a collection of community bloggers with views from across the political spectrum.
