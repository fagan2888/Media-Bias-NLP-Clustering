It means grasshopper soup, the favorite dish of the digger tribe\u2014and of the Pi-utes as well.\u201d\n\nThe term \u201cdigger\u201d is derogatory and refers to western tribes who dug roots for food.\n\nThomas Quirk, an English professor emeritus at the University of Missouri and leading Twain scholar, told the Associated Press that Twain did get over his racism toward blacks but Quirk hasn\u2019t found any evidence that the author\u2019s views on Native Americans ever changed.\n\nQuirk told the Associated Press that Twain did not embrace idolizing who he called the \u201cnoble red man,\u201d which was Twain\u2019s way of picking on James Fenimore Cooper.\n\nRELATED: Native History: \u2018The Last of the Mohicans\u2019 Is Published\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to African Americans, he was ahead of his time substantially,\u201d Quirk told the Associated Press. \u201cWhen it comes to Native Americans, his record is not very good. If he were alive today, he would sing a different tune.\u201d\n\nRobert Stewart, a member of the Nevada State Board on Geographic Names, actually dropped his support of the renaming even though he initiated it.\n\n\u201cI have a great deal of respect for the Washoe Tribe. And if their cultural committee is unhappy with naming the cove for Mark Twain, I\u2019m not going to fight them,\u201d Stewart told the Associated Press. \u201cWe need to show sensitivity to the tribe.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A cove on the shore of Lake Tahoe won't be renamed in honor of Mark Twain because of his racist views on Native Americans.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/05/19/racism-against-natives-dooms-mark-twain-honor-154941", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/mark-twain.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Racism Against Natives Dooms Mark Twain Honor"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dc": {"title": "Racism Against Natives Dooms Mark Twain Honor"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/05/19/racism-against-natives-dooms-mark-twain-honor-154941", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "dcterms.date": "2014-05-19T16:59-04:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Mark Twain, Last of the Mohicans, Native American History, Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 3}, "dcterms.title": "Racism Against Natives Dooms Mark Twain Honor"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb143\"", "article_summary": "And if their cultural committee is unhappy with naming the cove for Mark Twain, I\u2019m not going to fight them,\u201d Stewart told the Associated Press.\n\u201cI have a great deal of respect for the Washoe Tribe.\nA state panel in Nevada has opted to not name a Lake Tahoe cove for Mark Twain, saying the author was racist against Native Americans.\nQuirk told the Associated Press that Twain did not embrace idolizing who he called the \u201cnoble red man,\u201d which was Twain\u2019s way of picking on James Fenimore Cooper.\nCruz also mentioned a particular quote from Twain: \u201cPeople say that Tahoe means \u2018Silver Lake\u2019\u2014\u2018Limpid Water\u2019\u2014\u2018Falling Leaf.\u2019 Bosh!"}
