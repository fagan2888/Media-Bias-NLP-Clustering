Tara Mack said.\n\nTop Minnesota Republicans, like Mack \u2014 chair of the House Health and Human Services Reform Committee \u2014 say they are pushing to stop an imminent infusion of up to $90 million more into the once-troubled website.\n\nThey are calling for the state to abandon MNsure as we know it, and partner with the federal government\u2019s HealthCare.gov.\n\n\u201cI think the bottom line would be we would scrap MNsure, and go to a hybrid system where we wouldn\u2019t have a state-run exchange,\u201d Mack said, \u201cWe\u2019d go through the federal exchange, while the Department of Commerce would still maintain the ability to approve which plans are sold.\u201d\n\nFrom Washington, Minnesota reaction to the ruling split along party lines.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Al Franken called it, \u201ca huge victory for millions of people across the country \u2026 to have access to affordable health care.\u201d\n\nRepublicans like Rep. John Kline continued the call for repeal, calling the law, \u201cfundamentally flawed, and it doesn\u2019t change our resolve to repeal it.\u201d\n\nAt the State Capitol, Gov. Mark Dayton said the time for legal challenges to the health care law is over, and he urged Republicans to work with him to make it better.\n\n\u201cTo have some stability, to have the constitutionality of a major law like this be challenged again and again is really disruptive to the country,\u201d Dayton said.\n\nDayton says lawmakers should wait until a Blue Ribbon Health Care Commission report back in January is released before deciding what, if any, changes should be made to MNsure.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Supreme Court has upheld the nationwide tax subsidies under President Barack Obama's health care overhaul, in a ruling that preserves health insurance for millions of Americans.
