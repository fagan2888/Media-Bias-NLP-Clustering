On Monday, Army Secretary John McHugh criticized his former fellow lawmakers for not providing clear and predictable funding for the U.S. military. McHugh also had strong words for Beltway types who favor a smaller force with a smaller budget.\n\n\u201cIf the last 18 to 20 months haven\u2019t proven the necessity of a viable land force, I\u2019m not sure what will,\u201d McHugh said, at the Association of the U.S. Army\u2019s annual convention in Washington, the largest annual gathering of Army leaders.\n\nMcHugh departs a Pentagon that is relying yet again on temporary funding to keep the doors open and troops paid. The current measure lasts through December, and there\u2019s talk on Capitol Hill of extending it through next year.\n\n\u201cThe critical issue\u201d facing the Army right now, McHugh said, is getting beyond budget caps, continuing resolutions, and the uncertainty they foster.\n\nMcHugh wants more room for Army planners to breathe and for commanders to operate in the face of fast-moving and unpredictable threats.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t foresee the U.S. Army to be the foundational force to fight the Ebola outbreak in Western Africa,\u201d McHugh said, nor did U.S. leaders predict the \u201crapid pace of expansion of terrorist cells\u201d through Africa. And, he said, \u201cWe really didn\u2019t plan for Putin.\u201d\n\nFor the near future, the Army secretary fears \u201cwhat don\u2019t we see,\u201d he said. \u201cWill we have an army agile and ready enough to meet that challenge?\u201d he asked, or will Obama\u2019s next secretary face a \u201cfuture where the Army is built for a fantasy world that does not exist\u201d?\n\nMcHugh\u2019s chosen successor is Eric Fanning, acting undersecretary of the Army, former chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter and former acting Air Force secretary. McHugh urged Congress to confirm Fanning swiftly.\n\nAnother new face atop the Army, chief of staff Gen. Mark Milley, called the budget talk worrisome. But he spoke first about global threats.\n\n\u201cAs I look around the world today, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that the United States is safe,\u201d Milley said. \u201cBut having said that, the world outside the boundaries of the United States, the velocity of the instability is increasing as we sit here.\u201d\n\nTherefore, he said, it warrants the U.S. maintaining the capabilities of plus-sized forces, budgets, and equipment stores.\n\nWhat does McHugh think is behind the push to shrink the size and budget of the Army?\n\n\u201cAt its core, it\u2019s probably an unsupportable abundance of optimism,\u201d McHugh said, including \u201cthe wish that we could win wars totally from the air and from the sea...While optimism is a nice trait to have, it\u2019s probably not the best foundational basis upon which you build a military strategy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Kevin Baron", "description": "The Army, like the rest of the military, says its top worry is trying to prepare soldiers to fight when Congress can\u2019t even give them a budget.", "og": {"site_name": "Government Executive", "description": "The Army, like the rest of the military, says its top worry is trying to prepare soldiers to fight when Congress can\u2019t even give them a budget.", "title": "The Army's Biggest Concern Right Now Is Congress", "url": "http://www.govexec.com/defense/2015/10/armys-biggest-concern-right-now-congress/122736/", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/10/13/101315mchugh.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Army, like the rest of the military, says its top worry is trying to prepare soldiers to fight when Congress can\u2019t even give them a budget.", "creator": "@DefenseBaron", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/10/13/101315mchugh/open-graph.jpg", "title": "The Army's Biggest Concern Right Now Is Congress", "site": "@govexec", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-10-13T13:45:21Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/10/13/101315mchugh.jpg", "sailthru.title": "The Army's Biggest Concern Right Now Is Congress", "keywords": "army, sequestration, shutdown, continuing resolution, sequester", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/10/13/101315mchugh/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "army,sequestration,shutdown,continuing-resolution,channel-defense,type-story,length-medium,site-govexec", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/GovernmentExecutive"}, "sailthru.description": "The Army, like the rest of the military, says its top worry is trying to prepare soldiers to fight when Congress can\u2019t even give them a budget."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0f16\"", "article_summary": "On Monday, Army Secretary John McHugh criticized his former fellow lawmakers for not providing clear and predictable funding for the U.S. military.\nAnd, he said, \u201cWe really didn\u2019t plan for Putin.\u201dFor the near future, the Army secretary fears \u201cwhat don\u2019t we see,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe critical issue\u201d facing the Army right now, McHugh said, is getting beyond budget caps, continuing resolutions, and the uncertainty they foster.\nIt\u2019s something of a Washington tradition: the parting shot at Congress by a national-security leader on the way out.\nMcHugh\u2019s chosen successor is Eric Fanning, acting undersecretary of the Army, former chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter and former acting Air Force secretary."}
