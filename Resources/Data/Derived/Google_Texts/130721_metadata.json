PAUL, Minn. (AP) - Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton is banning state employees from nonessential travel to North Carolina because of that state's new law limiting official protections for gays and lesbians and transgender people.\n\nDayton sent a letter Saturday to all state employees, directing them to stop all nonessential travel to North Carolina for conferences or other official state business until further notice. The Democratic governor says North Carolina's new law \"violates the values and the laws\" of Minnesota.\n\nThe new law also requires transgender people to use public restroom facilities that correspond with their gender at birth.\n\nDayton joins a growing list of governors and mayors who've forbidden trips to North Carolina. The policy allows state-funded travel to North Carolina if it's necessary to protect the safety \"or other essential interests\" of Minnesotans.\n\n(Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.
