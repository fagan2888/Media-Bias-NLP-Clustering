Burwell is an \u201caccommodation\u201d created by the Obama administration to a provision of the Affordable Care Act that otherwise requires most employers to provide female workers access to coverage of FDA-approved contraception with no copay.\n\nUse Our Content This KHN story can be republished for free ( details ).\n\nHouses of worship are exempt from the requirement to provide contraceptive coverage, but religiously affiliated organizations (such as hospitals, universities and social service agencies) are required to submit information to their insurer or the government stating their religious objection. The insurer is then required to provide the coverage, under the accommodation.\n\nThe religious organizations that are suing, however, claim that the act of notifying the government or their insurance companies facilitates the coverage being provided, making them \u201ccomplicit\u201d in what they consider sinful.\n\nThe eight Supreme Court justices at last week\u2019s oral arguments appeared evenly divided over whether the requirement represented a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on the organizations\u2019 religious freedoms. (All but one lower court said it did not.) A 4-4 tie in the case (the seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia remains vacant) would leave the lower court rulings intact unless the court opts to take up the issue after Scalia\u2019s seat is filled. It also would create an unusual situation in which the rules would be enforced in most areas of the country, but not all.\n\nThe order issued Tuesday asked lawyers on both sides of the case to \u201cfile supplemental briefs that address whether and how contraceptive coverage may be obtained by petitioners\u2019 employees through petitioners\u2019 insurance companies, but in a way that does not require any involvement of petitioners beyond their own decision to provide health insurance without contraceptive coverage to their employees.\u201d The final deadline for the new briefs is April 20.\n\nAs for the potential compromise, the justices asked the lawyers specifically if the religious organizations might inform their insurers when initially contracting for insurance that they do not wish to offer contraceptive coverage. At that point, the insurance company, \u201caware that petitioners are not providing certain contraceptive coverage on religious grounds \u2014 would separately notify petitioners\u2019 employees that the insurance company will provide cost-free contraceptive coverage, and that such coverage is not paid for by petitioners and is not provided through petitioners\u2019 health plan.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, those on both sides of the case say they were heartened by the latest turn of events.\n\n\u201cI find it encouraging that they\u2019re asking for more information about how to ensure that women get contraception in their health plans,\u201d said Brigitte Amiri, senior staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union. Seeking a potential compromise, she said, \u201cseems to recognize that taking contraception out of health plans is harmful.\u201d\n\nDavid Cortman, senior counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom and the attorney representing two of the religious organizations suing the government, said he also finds the request to be \u201ca positive development.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe court addressed the very arguments that we\u2019ve been making all along, of being complicit,\u201d he said, and the justices appear to be making an effort to find some way to ensure that the benefits are provided, but the organizations are not required to violate their religious tenets in order for that to happen.\u201d\n\nCortman would not say whether the potential compromise raised in the order would be acceptable to his clients. \u201cIf it is truly outside of our health insurance plan and doesn\u2019t make the client complicit, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve suggested,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The request also hints at a potential compromise from the justices.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Kaiser Health News", "description": "The request also hints at a potential compromise from the justices.", "title": "Supreme Court Asks For More Information In Birth Control Case", "url": "http://khn.org/news/supreme-court-asks-for-more-information-in-birth-control-case/", "image": {"width": 770, "identifier": "https://kaiserhealthnews.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/supremecourtcontraception_770.jpg", "height": 513}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://kaiserhealthnews.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/supremecourtcontraception_770.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@khnews", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@khnews"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://khn.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "Kaiser Health News", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2016-03-29T20:30:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-30T13:08:38+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "El-hccfbhMd9lv-h8wAfp8Qu5KhqI8hjJMi1-CefIoQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf it is truly outside of our health insurance plan and doesn\u2019t make the client complicit, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve suggested,\u201d he said.\nThe eight Supreme Court justices at last week\u2019s oral arguments appeared evenly divided over whether the requirement represented a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on the organizations\u2019 religious freedoms.\nThe order also included a request for information about a scenario that might be a possible compromise in the case.\nAn apparently deadlocked Supreme Court is asking lawyers in a closely watched health law case to provide more information on how women working for religious employers might be able to get insurance coverage for contraception without violating the rights of their bosses.\nThe insurer is then required to provide the coverage, under the accommodation."}
