The eighth overall pick of the 2012 draft, Tannehill has started every game in his first three seasons and improved each year, although he has yet to lead Miami to a playoff berth.\n\nLast season he threw for 4,045 yards with 27 touchdowns, and his passer rating was 92.8. All of those figures were career highs.\n\n\u201cSigning Ryan to this deal is important to our franchise,\u201d general manager Dennis Hickey said. \u201cHe is a proven quarterback in this league that combines a talented skillset with work ethic, passion, toughness and a team-first mentality. We are committed and believe in Ryan as our quarterback for the long term, and we are excited to be able to sign him to this extension.\u201d\n\nThe 2016 salary will be a big increase for Tannehill after making a total of $12.7 million in the first four years of his contract.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Ryan Tannehill signs $77.7 million, 4-year extension with Miami Dolphins", "title": "Ryan Tannehill signs $77.7 million, 4-year extension with Miami Dolphins", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/18/ryan-tannehill-signs-77-7-million-4-year-extension-with-miami-dolphins/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150518__ryan-tannehillp1.jpg", "height": 426}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150518__ryan-tannehillp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-18T17:52:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T04:49:58+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "MIAMI \u2014 Ryan Tannehill signed a $77.7 million, four-year extension with the Miami Dolphins that keeps him under contract through 2020, the team said Monday.\n\u201cWe are thrilled that we were able to sign Ryan to an extension,\u201d said Mike Tannenbaum, executive vice president of football operations.\nThe eighth overall pick of the 2012 draft, Tannehill has started every game in his first three seasons and improved each year, although he has yet to lead Miami to a playoff berth.\nHe\u2019s the first quarterback to receive an extension from the 2012 draft class that also included the Colts\u2019 Andrew Luck, the Redskins\u2019 Robert Griffin III and the Seahawks\u2019 Russell Wilson.\n\u201cSigning Ryan to this deal is important to our franchise,\u201d general manager Dennis Hickey said."}
