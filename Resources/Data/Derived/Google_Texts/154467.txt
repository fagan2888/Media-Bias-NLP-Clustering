WASHINGTON (AP) - Washington Performing Arts is starting a new urban arts initiative linking neighborhood artists and prominent performances in the area beginning this weekend in the Brookland neighborhood.

On Saturday, the Mars Urban Arts Initiative will include a community puppet build at Brookland’s farmer’s market from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. The event is free and will give families the chance to make their own puppets.

Jacqueline Badger Mars and candy maker Mars Inc. is funding the new initiative.

On Monday, there will be a puppetry slam with short skits and monologues at Busboys and Poets on K Street. Then on Tuesday, a marionette theater show at the Kennedy Center’s Terrace Theatre will feature pianist Orion Weiss and The Salzburg Marionettes.
