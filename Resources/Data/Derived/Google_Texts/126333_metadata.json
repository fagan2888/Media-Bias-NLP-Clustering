Ferguson case, which was the law of the land for nearly six decades despite evidence that \u201cequal\u201d tended not to be part of the equation. African-Americans during the Jim Crow era that followed didn\u2019t have equal access to quality housing or education, creating conditions that analysts say has led to several generations of urban poverty. Here is your Three-Minute Briefing, all the News You Can Use in 180 seconds or less:\n\nObamacare Death Panel: As the positives for Obamacare continued to accrue \u2013 increases in insurance coverage, less public acrimony and no health care apocalypses as had been predicted \u2013 and a conservative-backed challenge to the law made its way to the Supreme Court, congressional Republicans suggested they\u2019d fix things if SCOTUS gutted the law. But now that the court is on the brink of ruling in the King v. Burwell case, there\u2019s no clear Republican plan on a temporary Obamacare fix, and the GOP in fact may be choreographing a victory dance.\n\nCharles in Charge: Criminal justice reform is becoming a thing, and not just on the campaign trail. Taking a cue from senators and best bros Corey Booker of New Jersey and Rand Paul of Kentucky, the latter of whom just happens to be running for president, Congress is taking up the mantle of change for a system that disproportionately puts African-Americans behind bars, largely because of nonviolent drug offenses. And there appears to be a new and unlikely proponent of said change: Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a conservative who delivered a speech and other remarks recently that hint he\u2019s open to talking about adjusting mandatory minimum drug sentences.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Washington Whispers [News]", "title": "Jeb Bush\u2019s Iraq Quagmire Sucks In GOP Field", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "POTUS talks police reform in Jersey, and has Hillary picked a running mate?", "title": "Briefing: Jeb\u2019s Iraq Stumble Trips Up 2016 Field", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2015/05/18/jeb-bushs-iraq-quagmire-sucks-in-gop-field", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/13/15/debc8e0b4192b1d06efef50dd92a/150518-jebbush-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "POTUS talks police reform in Jersey, and has Hillary picked a running mate?", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Jeb Bush\u2019s Iraq Quagmire Sucks In GOP Field"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "May 18, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Joseph P.
