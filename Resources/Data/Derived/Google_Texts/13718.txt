SEATTLE — Marshawn Lynch rushed for 110 and two touchdowns, Russell Wilson threw a pair of touchdown passes and the Seattle Seahawks started defense of their Super Bowl title with a 36-16 win over the Green Bay Packers on Thursday night.

Lynch, who ran for 1,257 yards and 12 touchdowns last season, barreled through a trio of Packers for the TD with 3:41 left before halftime to give the Seahawks a 17-10 lead. He added a 3-yard TD run on the first play of the fourth quarter for a 29-10 advantage.

Wilson made sure everyone knew Percy Harvin was healthy finding the speedy receiver seven times.

Aaron Rodgers threw for 189 yards and a touchdown, but the Packers‘ up-tempo offense was stymied by Seattle.
