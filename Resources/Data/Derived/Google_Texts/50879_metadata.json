On Wednesday, Gallup released its newest estimates for the uninsurance rate in America. As you can see, it has plummeted since Obamacare takes effect\u2014and continues to fall:\n\nAs Jonathan Cohn explained in The New Republic in September, the law is succeeding in many other ways as well. Health care costs are growing at a slower pace\u2014although it\u2019s unclear how much that is due to Obamacare or other outside factors. Premiums haven\u2019t skyrocketed. Insurers aren\u2019t fleeing the exchanges. But Republican comments about the law haven\u2019t changed. For years, they unequivocally declared that Obamacare, as Ryan said Wednesday, \u201cwill collapse under its own weight.\u201d By no definition is the law collapsing under its own weight. And all signals\u2014the ones I mentioned above\u2014indicate that the law won\u2019t ever collapse under its own weight.\n\nRepublicans have forced themselves into an impossible position by setting the expectations for failure so high. Since those expectations haven't been met, they have two options: Either backtrack on the original message or double down on it. The former is politically impossible given the conservative base's insistence that their elected officials oppose the ACA at all cost. So they\u2019re left with the latter\u2014and that only makes Ryan and others look foolish as the good news about Obamacare keeps rolling in.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Representative Paul Ryan published a short piece in USA Today on&nbsp;Wednesday arguing that Obamacare&nbsp;\"will collapse under its own weight.\" \u201cYou can't fix a fundamentally broken law; you've got to replace it,\u201d he writes. \u201cThat's why Congress can't save Obamacare with a few tweaks, despite what its defenders say.\u201dRepublicans have made similar comments ad nauseam since the law passed, and ever...", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "This chart says otherwise.", "title": "Paul Ryan Still Thinks Obamacare \"Will Collapse Under Its Own Weight\"", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/833aac3e4e59bc2b6c000557e6b6a147281e91c0.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/120711/paul-ryan-obamacare-will-collapse-uninsurance-rates-say-otherwise", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/833aac3e4e59bc2b6c000557e6b6a147281e91c0.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "title": "Paul Ryan Still Thinks Obamacare \"Will Collapse Under Its Own Weight\"", "site": "@newrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "This chart says otherwise."}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/833aac3e4e59bc2b6c000557e6b6a147281e91c0.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Paul Ryan Still Thinks Obamacare \\\"Will Collapse Under Its Own Weight.\\\" This Chart Says Otherwise.\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/120711/paul-ryan-obamacare-will-collapse-uninsurance-rates-say-otherwise\",\"section\":\"Obamacare\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-01-07T21:44:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":120711,\"author\":\"Danny Vinik\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Obamacare\",\"Politics\",\"QED\",\"Obamacaer\",\"Paul Ryan\",\"Health\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Obamacare", "published_time": "2015-01-07"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda8f3\"", "article_summary": "Representative Paul Ryan published a short piece in USA Today on Wednesday arguing that Obamacare \"will collapse under its own weight.\"\nSo they\u2019re left with the latter\u2014and that only makes Ryan and others look foolish as the good news about Obamacare keeps rolling in.\nFor years, they unequivocally declared that Obamacare, as Ryan said Wednesday, \u201cwill collapse under its own weight.\u201d By no definition is the law collapsing under its own weight.\nBut Republican comments about the law haven\u2019t changed.\nAnd all signals\u2014the ones I mentioned above\u2014indicate that the law won\u2019t ever collapse under its own weight."}
