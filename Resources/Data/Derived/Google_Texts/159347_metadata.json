During premenstrual syndrome (PMS), hormones begin to fluctuate and alter the levels of brain chemicals that keep you balanced and alert, but what exactly happens to the brain during your period?\n\nThe Menstrual Cycle: Menstruation\n\nTypically, women go through monthly bleeding as the body sheds the lining of the uterus while menstrual blood flows from it through the small opening in the cervix and through the vagina. Most menstrual periods last from three to five days, says the Office on Women\u2019s Health, with the average menstrual cycle lasting 28 days long. A regular menstrual cycle exists when periods come regularly, hinting important parts of the body are working normally. It is the very rise and fall of hormone levels during the month that control the menstrual cycle.\n\nThe Highs And Lows Of Estrogen And The Female Brain\n\nThe levels of estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone \u2014 the three major hormones that control the menstrual cycle \u2014 are relatively low during the first day of bleeding. Usually, after the first few days, there will be a surge of estrogen levels that will stimulate the release of endorphins that eliminate the mental change or hormonal cloud present during PMS.\n\n\u201cEstrogen levels are closely linked with women\u2019s emotional well-being as estrogen affects parts of the brain that control emotions,\u201d Dr. Ben Michaelis, a clinical psychologist in New York City and author of Your Next Big Thing, told Medical Daily. He believes the first few days of menstruation usually mark the \u201chappy time\u201d of the month, as some women report feeling more energetic, happy, and even inspired. This is why the rise in estrogen levels helps suppress stress hormones adrenaline and cortisol.\n\nThe effects of the female hormone are so potent when it comes to brain health. A 2000 study published in the journal PNAS found estrogen increases synaptic connectivity in the hippocampus by 25 percent. The hippocampus is involved in short-term memory and decision-making.\n\nThe rise in estrogen levels during the menstrual cycle deters women from impulsive decision-making. A 2014 study published in the Journal of Neuroscience found greater increases in estrogen levels across the menstrual cycle compared to impulsive behavior during the beginning of menstruation when estrogen levels are low.\n\nHowever, low estrogen levels during the beginning of the menstrual cycle can provide benefits. Women tend to display greater brain activity when thinking about positive experience such as winning money at the start of their cycle than women who are in the other stages of the cycle. A 2008 study published in the journal PNAS confirmed what determined if a woman is an impulsive decision-maker is what stage of the cycle she\u2019s in and her estrogen levels. The higher the estrogen levels, the less impulsive a woman is likely to be.\n\nThe Rise Of Testosterone And The Female Brain\n\nWhile estrogen increases synaptic connectivity, testosterone production increases a woman\u2019s sex drive during her period, as progesterone is lowest during this time. The combination of both increasing estrogen and testosterone levels leads women tend to feel more sexual. Pelvic congestion, or the heaviness felt during menstruation can trigger or translate to arousal. \u201cThe rise of testosterone, one of the hormones that regulate sex drive, is associated with an increased libido in women and greater sexual arousal,\u201d Michaelis said.\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s believed because of the additional lubrication from menstruation, this makes penetration more comfortable.\n\nPeriod Pain And The Female Brain\n\nPeriod pain is very common and often experienced by about three out of four girls and women who experience a varying intensity at some point during menstruation, according to PubMed Health. Many girls and women experience common problems like abdominal cramps and pain. However, whether the pain is mild or severe, period-induced pain can cloud your cognitive functioning.\n\nAccording to Michaelis, \u201cMenstrual pain and cramps may be associated with brain changes.\u201d\n\nWomen who get painful menstrual cramps are more likely to show changes in the volume of the brain\u2019s gray matter. This part of the brain is brain tissue made up of nerve cell bodies as opposed to fibers that are involved in the transmission and control of pain, including emotional responses. For example, a 2010 study published in the journal Pain found there were abnormal gray matter decreases found in regions involved in pain transmission, higher level sensory processing, and affected regulation, while increases were found in regions involved in pain modulation and in regulation of endocrine function in the pain group.\n\nPeriod pain does not only affect gray matter, but overall cognitive functioning. Common everyday pain experienced by women each month affects their ability to perform a range of complex tasks. A 2014 study published in the journal PAIN menstrual cramps have a noticeably negative effect on a woman\u2019s ability to perform tasks. Women with period pains had a lower performance rating comparable to their non-period counterparts as they struggled with attention-based jobs, such as competing targets and dividing their attention between two tasks.\n\nMenstruation And Brain Power\n\nA woman\u2019s menstrual cycle affects her brain in a number of ways, for better or for worse. Estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone fluctuate during a woman\u2019s menstrual cycle. The hippocampus, hypothalamus, and the amygdala tend to be affected the most by the estrogen-progesterone surges and drops. The surges of these hormones can influence a woman\u2019s mood, self-esteem, and how she connects to others.\n\nUnderstanding these fluctuations and their effects on the brain can help not only doctors but women comprehend why they feel the way they feel during their menstrual cycle.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "symptoms of menstruation, hormone levels, the female brain, estrogen, testosterone, cognitive function, brain function, brain activity, pms, period pain, menstrual cycle", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "This is how the fluctuation of hormones and menstrual pain affect the shape of your brain.", "title": "This Is Your Brain When You're On Your Period", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/menstruation-and-female-brain-how-fluctuating-hormone-levels-impact-cognitive-341788", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/07/woman-period-pain.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This is how the fluctuation of hormones and menstrual pain affect the shape of your brain.", "title": "This Is Your Brain When You're On Your Period", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/menstruation-and-female-brain-how-fluctuating-hormone-levels-impact-cognitive-341788", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/07/woman-period-pain.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/07/woman-period-pain.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Under the Hood", "published_time": "2015-07-08T07:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-08T14:17:26-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "This is how the fluctuation of hormones and menstrual pain affect the shape of your brain."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1b31\"", "article_summary": "It is the very rise and fall of hormone levels during the month that control the menstrual cycle.\nMenstruation And Brain PowerA woman\u2019s menstrual cycle affects her brain in a number of ways, for better or for worse.\nA 2014 study published in the Journal of Neuroscience found greater increases in estrogen levels across the menstrual cycle compared to impulsive behavior during the beginning of menstruation when estrogen levels are low.\nA regular menstrual cycle exists when periods come regularly, hinting important parts of the body are working normally.\nMost menstrual periods last from three to five days, says the Office on Women\u2019s Health, with the average menstrual cycle lasting 28 days long."}
