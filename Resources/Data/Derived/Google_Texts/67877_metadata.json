The 13-year-old boy was found inside of the house of his father in Clayton County, Georgia.\n\nPolice arrested the teenage boy\u2019s father and four other people, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. He was reunited with his mother shortly after he was found by the police early Saturday morning, about 2:00 a.m.\n\nThe boy\u2019s father and the boy\u2019s stepmother have been charged with cruelty to children, false imprisonment and obstruction. The police have also arrested three juveniles in connection with the case.\n\nAccording to WSB, in 2010, the teenage boy visited his father. Then, the father refused to return the teenage boy and kept him hidden away behind a false wall in the house for the past four years.\n\nAuthorities had to perform two searches on the house before they found the 13-year-old teen and then he made a phone call to his mother, who lives out of state. The teenage boy has been reunited with his mother.\n\nWritten By Douglas Cobb\n\nSources:\n\nKOAA.com\n\nNBC News\n\nPhoto by Georgia National Guard \u2013 Flickr Page\n\nShare this: Print\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nTumblr\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Guardian Liberty Voice", "description": "Police in Georgia have made five arrests in connection with the discovery of a teenage boy imprisoned behind a wall for four years.
