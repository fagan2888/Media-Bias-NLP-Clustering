As haze and smoke from Pacific Northwest wildfires infiltrate northern Colorado, a health advisory has been issued for those who might be sensitive to the air quality.

The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment issued a wildfire smoke health advisory through 9 a.m. Monday for northeastern Colorado east of the Divide and north of Interstate 70, according to a department news release.

Cities affected by this advisory include Denver, Fort Collins, Greeley, Golden, Littleton, Brighton, Limon, Burlington, Fort Morgan, Sterling and Julesburg.

The department recommends limiting outdoor activity when moderate to heavy smoke is present, especially for those who suffer from heart disease, respiratory illnesses, the very young and the elderly.

“If visibility is less than five miles in your neighborhood, smoke has reached levels that are unhealthy,” the release said.

Firefighters from across Colorado are being sent to help fight the Pacific Northwest wildfires that are raging through the region.
