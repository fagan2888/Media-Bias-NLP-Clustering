Monica Stonier, who represents the 17th Legislative District, in which Gatens Thompson lives, and asked Stonier to make it happen.\n\nThis legislative session, she did just that.\n\n\u201cShe wrote the bill and had bipartisan support, and it passed the legislature with no opposition,\u201d Gatens Thompson said. \u201cWe all know that rarely happens.\u201d\n\nThe plates have the same Mount Rainier background as the traditional plates, but the sky is tinted pink. The plates also feature a pink ribbon \u2014 the universal symbol for breast cancer awareness \u2014 and have \u201cEarly detection saves lives\u201d written across the bottom.\n\nEarlier this month, the first 18 breast cancer license plates were put up for sale through an online auction. They\u2019ll be available for $60 through the state Department of Licensing beginning in January.\n\nThe money from the sale of the plates will benefit the state Department of Health\u2019s Breast, Cervical and Colon Health Program, which provides cancer screenings for low-income Washington residents who are uninsured and underinsured.\n\nFor her role in making the plates a reality, Gatens Thompson will be given plate No. 19 \u2014 the first of the plates available after the auction.\n\nIn June \u2014 just a few months after Stonier\u2019s bill was passed and signed by the governor \u2014 Gatens Thompson was diagnosed with breast cancer for the second time. She had a partial mastectomy and is currently undergoing chemotherapy. In January, she\u2019ll begin radiation.\n\nHer cancer was discovered during a routine mammogram.\n\nCancer screening\n\nThe Breast, Cervical and Colon Health Program was established in 1998. The following year, PeaceHealth Southwest Medical Center became the prime contractor administering the program\u2019s services in Clark County.\n\nIn the past year, funding for the program has been cut as a result of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion and insurance mandate that went into effect in January.\n\nThe majority of the program\u2019s funding comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The state and Susan G. Komen also contribute some money to the program. Next year, the state is eliminating its portion of the funding, said Kathleen Pyper, the program coordinator for Southwest Washington.\n\nThat\u2019s because state officials believe the need for the program is eliminated by the Medicaid expansion and the requirement for everyone to have health insurance coverage.\n\n\u201cA lot of people in the state believed the ACA would eliminate health disparities, and it has not,\u201d Pyper said.\n\nThe Southwest Washington region encompasses nine counties from Grays Harbor, Mason and Thurston counties to Clark and Skamania counties. Last grant year, the program budget for the region was about $1 million. This grant year, which began July 1, the budget is about $680,000, Pyper said.\n\nWhile the Affordable Care Act has reduced the number of people who are uninsured, it hasn\u2019t eliminated the uninsured population entirely, Pyper said.\n\nWomen who don\u2019t qualify for the state Medicaid program still may not be able to afford to purchase an individual health plan, she said. In addition, illegal immigrants are not eligible for Medicaid or insurance subsidies and often go without health coverage, Pyper said.\n\n\u201cWe do know the community is still out there,\u201d she said. \u201cThe need is still there.\u201d\n\nThe program typically enrolls about 1,600 to 1,800 women across the nine Southwest Washington counties in a year. In the grant year that ended June 30, the program enrolled about 1,100 women, many of whom had previously gone without cancer screenings, Pyper said. Out of about 900 women screened in the past 12 months, 32 women were diagnosed with cancer, she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re catching cancer. We\u2019re diagnosing cancer,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if the Affordable Care Act is here. There are still women out there without insurance, and they still have cancer.\u201d\n\nGatens Thompson had never heard of the Breast, Cervical and Colon Health Program before working with Stonier on the license plate campaign. Making the program the license plate beneficiary was Stonier\u2019s idea, Gatens Thompson said.\n\nAs a cancer survivor, Gatens Thompson was thrilled with the decision.\n\n\u201cThe proceeds to me are probably the beauty of the whole thing Monica put together,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are people who would not get the preventive care. \u2026 The preventive screening, that\u2019s the icing on the cake.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Vancouver resident Maureen Gatens Thompson had seen pink-tinged breast cancer awareness license plates on cars in other states, and she wanted to see simil", "application-name": "", "og": {"site_name": "The Columbian", "description": "Vancouver resident Maureen Gatens Thompson had seen pink-tinged breast cancer awareness license plates on cars in other states, and she wanted to see similar pink-ribboned plates in Washington.", "title": "State to get breast cancer license plates", "url": "http://www.columbian.com/news/2014/oct/27/state-to-get-breast-cancer-license-plates/", "image": "http://16749-presscdn-0-94.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/columbian/static/img/columbian_c_200x200.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "columbian.com", "creator": "MarissaHarshman", "site": "@thecolumbian", "card": "summary", "title": "State to get breast cancer license plates"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#3A5B7C", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 1256005586, "app_id": 122928857737763}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://16749-presscdn-0-94.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/columbian/static/img/windows-tiles/square-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thecolumbian", "section": "Carousel,Editor's Choice,Health,Latest News,Life,Local News,News", "published_time": "2014-10-27 00:00:00"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce0ac\"", "article_summary": "Earlier this month, the first 18 breast cancer license plates were put up for sale through an online auction.\nA AHow to get yours \u2022 The state is selling the first 18 breast cancer license plates through an online auction, <a href=\"http://www.32auctions.com/wabreastcancerplate\">www.32auctions.com/wabreastcancerplate</a> The auction ends at 6 p.m. Friday.\nFor more information on the program visit www.doh.wa.gov/bcchpVancouver resident Maureen Gatens Thompson had seen pink-tinged breast cancer awareness license plates on cars in other states, and she wanted to see similar pink-ribboned plates in Washington.\nFor more information on the program visit <a href=\"http://www.doh.wa.gov/bcchp\">www.doh.wa.gov/bcchp</a>How to get yours\u2022 The state is selling the first 18 breast cancer license plates through an online auction, www.32auctions.com/wabreastcancerplate The auction ends at 6 p.m. Friday.\nThe plates also feature a pink ribbon \u2014 the universal symbol for breast cancer awareness \u2014 and have \u201cEarly detection saves lives\u201d written across the bottom."}
