A Street in Arkansas City. She said her estranged husband came to her home while she was in the restroom and that she heard gunshots. She told dispatchers she had taken her 12-year-old daughter and ran out of the house and was currently at a neighbor\u2019s.\n\nMinutes later, dispatchers received a second call from neighbor Stephen Sanders. Sanders tells KAKE News he told dispatchers a man \"who was bleeding real bad\" had collapsed and was yelling for help in front of his home on East Madison.\n\nOfficers arrived and found a 44-year old man with a stab wound. He was taken to a nearby hospital where he later died.\n\nPolice identified the man late Sunday night as Leonard D. Daniels.\n\nAs they investigated, officers say they learned that when the woman came out of the restroom she was met by her estranged husband and an argument ensued.\n\nA second man, Cameron Budd, 23, who is the woman's friend, approached the couple.\n\nPolice say Budd stabbed Daniels in the back. Daniels turned around with a gun and fired several shots at the Budd, grazing him once. The two struggled again before Budd ran out of the house.\n\nDuring that altercation is when the woman grabbed her 12-year old daughter and ran to the neighbor\u2019s to call 911.\n\nWhen the officers arrived, Budd was not at the scene. A short time later, he turned himself into the Arkansas City Police Department. He was then arrested and booked into the Cowley County jail on a charge of involuntary manslaughter.\n\nHe is expected to make his first appearance in court early this week.\n\nNeighbors say there is a history of domestic violence between Daniels and the woman. They say police have been called to the home at least three times in the past couple months.\n\nNeighbors Justin and Christy Merry say they have called police during several of the disturbances. They say they have feared for their safety and the safety of their 2-year-old son.\n\n\"I feel like I can't even let him play in the yard because you never know when he is going to show up,\" Christy Merry said.\n\nThey say in the most recent incident, which occurred on May 21st, Daniels violated a no-contact order, broke into the house, and locked himself upstairs. He involved police in a 6-hour standoff before being arrested.\n\nOffender records for Daniels do not reflect when he was released from jail.\n\nThe Merry's say given Daniels' violent history, they believe Budd did the right thing.\n\n\"He probably just had to do what he had to do at the time. I'm sure she had told him everything that was going so when he saw him he was probably scared and freaking out,\" Christy Merry said.\n\n\"I think he was protecting her and the 12-year-old. I seriously think that,\" Justin Merry said.\n\nThe Merry's say they hope this marks the end of a very violent chapter.\n\n\"I think it was bound to happen sooner or later, either her being hurt or him,\" Christy Merry said.\n\n\"I'm just glad nobody else got hurt,\" Justin Merry said.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "A 44-year old man was stabbed in the back early Sunday morning in Cowley County and then later died of his wounds a short time after being transported to the South Central Regional Medical Center for treatment.", "language": "english", "author": "KAKE News", "og": {"description": "A 44-year old man was stabbed in the back early Sunday morning in Cowley County and then later died of his wounds a short time after being transported to the South Central Regional Medical Center for treatment.", "title": "Arrest made in stabbing death of Ark City man", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Arrest-made-in-stabbing-death-of-Ark-City-man.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/784/545/78454587A25849299EEC94E485102BF9", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/C4C/6F3/C4C6F37532EF472795790EDB2D6E2B9E.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "A 44-year old man was stabbed in the back early Sunday morning in Cowley County and then later died of his wounds a short time after being transported to the South Central Regional Medical Center for treatment.", "title": "Arrest made in stabbing death of Ark City man", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Arrest-made-in-stabbing-death-of-Ark-City-man.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/ark+city+stabbing.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Arrest made in stabbing death of Ark City man", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Arrest made in stabbing death"}, "article_summary": "Neighbors Justin and Christy Merry say they have called police during several of the disturbances.\n\"I feel like I can't even let him play in the yard because you never know when he is going to show up,\" Christy Merry said.\nMore Video...Credit: NewsCowA man is dead and another is in jail after a domestic dispute ends in a shooting and stabbing.\n\"I think it was bound to happen sooner or later, either her being hurt or him,\" Christy Merry said.\nPolice say Budd stabbed Daniels in the back."}
