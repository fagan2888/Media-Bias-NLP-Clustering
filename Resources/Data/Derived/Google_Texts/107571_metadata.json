Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the head of the Guard\u2019s aerospace division, said Israelis will see Hezbollah\u2019s new might should a war break out. Slain Hezbollah commander Hassan al-Laqis had played a key role in boosting the group\u2019s military strength, he added, without elaborating. The comments were posted on the Guard\u2019s website, sepahnews.com.\n\n\u201cHezbollah\u2019s capability has improved so tremendously in recent years that it can hit and destroy any target in the occupied lands with very little inaccuracy and pinpoint ability,\u201d he said, referring to Israel. The assertions could not be verified, and Iran often claims technological advances with its own military that similarly cannot be confirmed.\n\nAl-Laqis was assassinated last month in southern Beirut, a blow to the Iranian-backed Hezbollah. Iran\u2019s top Revolutionary Guard commanders, including its Quds Force chief Gen. Qassem Soleimani, attended a service earlier this week in Tehran in commemoration of the slain commander.\n\n\u201cHe (al-Laqis) was a great, resourceful and very active Hezbollah commander whose works could be revealed should a Hezbollah-Israel war break out. He created great defense supplies,\u201d and was \u201cone of Hezbollah\u2019s brains in the field of electronic war,\u201d Hajizadeh said.\n\nThe assassination of Al-Laqis, widely described as the head of the group\u2019s telecommunications network and an expert at procuring strategic weapons, was a significant loss for Hezbollah, who blamed Israel for his death.\n\nIsrael believes al-Laqis played a significant role in obtaining weapons, including long-range rockets, despite airstrikes launched by the Jewish state inside Syria to try and stop weapons shipments into Lebanon.\n\nHajizadeh didn\u2019t say how Hezbollah\u2019s missile capability had improved, but Israeli media has reported that the group has been moving long-range missiles to Lebanon from bases where it had stored them inside Syria.\n\nThe missiles shipped into Lebanon reportedly include long-range Scud D missiles that can strike deep into Israel, shorter-range Scud C\u2019s, medium-range solid-fueled Fateh missile as well as Fajr rockets, both of which are made in Iran. Shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles are also reported to be in the arsenal.\n\nU.S. officials believe the weapons were transferred into Lebanon from Syria piece-by-piece to evade Israeli air strikes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Lebanese militant Shiite movement Hezbollah has dramatically improved its missile capabilities and can now pinpoint targets anywhere in Israel, a senior commander of Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guards said Saturday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Lebanese militant Shiite movement Hezbollah has dramatically improved its missile capabilities and can now pinpoint targets anywhere in Israel, a senior commander of Iran\u2019s powerful Revolutionary Guards said Saturday.", "title": "Hezbollah can now pinpoint missile targets anywhere in Israel, says Iranian general", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/11/hezbollah-can-now-pinpoint-missile-targets-anywher/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2012/11/18/israel_111802.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2012/11/18/israel_111802.jpg", "description": "The Lebanese militant Shiite movement Hezbollah has dramatically improved its missile capabilities and can now pinpoint targets anywhere in Israel, a senior commander of Iran's powerful Revolutionary", "card": "summary", "title": "Hezbollah can now pinpoint missile targets anywhere in Israel, says Ir"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, War Conflict, Hezbollah, Israel, Iran"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0dc3\"", "article_summary": "TEHRAN, Iran \u2014 The Lebanese militant Shiite movement Hezbollah has dramatically improved its missile capabilities and can now pinpoint targets anywhere in Israel, a senior commander of Iran\u2019s powerful Revolutionary Guards said Saturday.\nSlain Hezbollah commander Hassan al-Laqis had played a key role in boosting the group\u2019s military strength, he added, without elaborating.\n\u201cHe (al-Laqis) was a great, resourceful and very active Hezbollah commander whose works could be revealed should a Hezbollah-Israel war break out.\nU.S. officials believe the weapons were transferred into Lebanon from Syria piece-by-piece to evade Israeli air strikes.\nHajizadeh didn\u2019t say how Hezbollah\u2019s missile capability had improved, but Israeli media has reported that the group has been moving long-range missiles to Lebanon from bases where it had stored them inside Syria."}
