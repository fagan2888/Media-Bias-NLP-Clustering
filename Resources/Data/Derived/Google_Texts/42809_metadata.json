So she lived through a revolution in health care.\n\nHer family was wealthy in a \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d sort of way, with cooks, butlers and maids. Her father educated her at home; she learned Greek, Latin, French, German and Italian, history and music.\n\nThen she turned 17, and it was time to get a husband. She rebelled. She didn\u2019t want to marry; she wanted to work in hospitals as a nurse, taking care of the sick poor. In 1837 this was unheard-of. Nursing was done by servants, and her family looked upon her idea, she wrote, as if she\u2019d \u201cgone to be a maid of all work.\u201d\n\nThey fought it out for 15 years. She turned down every suitor; she took every opportunity for training as a nurse, and eventually she won. Her father granted her an annuity, and she took over a hospital on Harley Street where she put her ideas into practice.\n\nThen came the Crimean War. It was the first war with correspondents at the front, and they reported on the thousands of soldiers dying at hospitals from typhoid fever, cholera and dysentery. Nightingale, whose work was well known by then, was asked to go to the Crimean Peninsula.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat she saw there \u2014 the filth, the lack of food, bandages, even latrines \u2014 stunned her, scarred her and energized her for the rest of her life. In that uncaring chaos, she had a vision of its opposite, of how things could be \u2014 shining hospitals with professional nurses and medical care for everyone, especially the poor, \u201cwho, when they are sick, become our brothers.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nShe spent the rest of her life making that vision a reality.\n\nShe wrote \u201cNotes on Nursing,\u201d which became a best seller and made her financially independent. She reorganized Britain\u2019s army hospitals and reformed the nursing in workhouses. She founded the first real school for nurses, and its graduates \u2014 \u201cNightingales\u201d\u2014 carried her reformation throughout the world. She wrote on public health, sanitation, India and prostitution, and for 50 years she was behind most of the health-related legislation in England. All this even though she was bedridden from chronic brucellosis, an infection she\u2019d contracted in Crimea.\n\nIn her lifetime, she was esteemed. Queen Victoria wished aloud that she had Nightingale in her cabinet; babies, buildings and streets were named after her. When she died, burial in Westminster Abbey was offered, though her family, respecting her wishes, turned it down.\n\nSo much of what she fought for we take for granted today \u2014 our beautiful hospitals, the honored nursing profession, data-driven research.\n\nWhat would she have thought of the Affordable Care Act? She would have liked its emphasis on public health, on data and on adequate care for everyone. There\u2019s just one thing she would have missed \u2014 her belief that caring for the sick is not a business but a calling.\n\nShe didn\u2019t mean \u201ccalling\u201d in a religious sense. She meant having a kind of feeling for one\u2019s work \u2014 an inner sense of what is right, which she termed \u201centhusiasm,\u201d from the Greek entheos, having a god within. The opposite of a \u201ccalling\u201d was \u201ctelling\u201d \u2014 that is, rewards, punishments and threats \u2014 and she observed that without a calling, no amount of telling would satisfy. Which is what would have worried her about the Affordable Care Act. It relies on telling, on thousands of new regulations, rules and laws. There\u2019s no calling in it.\n\nNow, Nightingale understood the different goals of doctor, nurse, lawyer and economist. From her study of hospitals she\u2019d concluded that patients get the best care when no single power is ascendant, rather when there is the \u201cperpetual rub\u201d between doctor, nurse and administrator.\n\nWhat would have worried her about the health care act is that its balance is off: It gives too much power to the telling of economists and lawyers and too little to the calling of doctors and nurses.\n\nNightingale, however, was an optimist. God wants us to make mistakes, she believed; mistakes are the basis of evolution. She was also a fighter, so I imagine she would have seen the health care law as a work in progress, and what we have still to learn from her, even so long after her death, is her willingness to fight and her determination to get it right. She didn\u2019t accept being told in her own life, and she wouldn\u2019t have wanted us to accept it in ours.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140303161730, "twitter": {"description": "How a pioneering nurse remains important long after her death.", "title": "Far More Than a Lady With a Lamp", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/04/health/florence-nightingales-wisdom.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002746969"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/04/science/04FLOR1_SPAN/04FLOR1-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/04/health/florence-nightingales-wisdom.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002746969", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/04/health/florence-nightingales-wisdom.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "health", "hdl_p": "Far More Than a Lady With a Lamp", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 3, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Nursing and Nurses,Hygiene and Cleanliness,Hospitals,Medicine and Health,Nightingale  Florence", "news_keywords": "Hospital", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Victoria Sweet", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/04/science/04FLOR1_SPAN/04FLOR1-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Nightingale, Florence", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By VICTORIA SWEET", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "How a pioneering nurse remains important long after her death.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/04/science/04FLOR1_SPAN/04FLOR1-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "How a pioneering nurse remains important long after her death.", "CG": "health", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "March 3, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/health/index.html", "section": "Health", "modified": "2014-03-05", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "tag": "Nightingale, Florence", "published": "2014-03-03", "section-taxonomy-id": "7D6BE1AF-8CD8-430B-8B2A-17CD0EAA99AC"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "04florence", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140305114702, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/04/health/florence-nightingales-wisdom.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/04/science/04FLOR1_SPAN/04FLOR1_SPAN-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "How a pioneering nurse remains important long after her death.", "title": "Far More Than a Lady With a Lamp"}, "pdate": 20140303, "des": "Medicine and Health", "articleid": 100000002746969, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Far More Than a Lady With a Lamp", "col": "On Medicine", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb3b0\"", "article_summary": "So she lived through a revolution in health care.\nShe didn\u2019t want to marry; she wanted to work in hospitals as a nurse, taking care of the sick poor.\nSo much of what she fought for we take for granted today \u2014 our beautiful hospitals, the honored nursing profession, data-driven research.\nThe opposite of a \u201ccalling\u201d was \u201ctelling\u201d \u2014 that is, rewards, punishments and threats \u2014 and she observed that without a calling, no amount of telling would satisfy.\nShe turned down every suitor; she took every opportunity for training as a nurse, and eventually she won."}
