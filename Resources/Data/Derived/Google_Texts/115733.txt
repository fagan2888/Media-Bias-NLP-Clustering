In January, Grady Memorial Hospital will learn whether the Fulton County Commission will go through with a proposed $25 million cut in the county's contribution to the hospital. That's a 50% reduction in county support for Grady. In part 2 of a conversation with Grady CEO John Haupert, WABE's Denis O'Hayer asked him about the search for alternate sources of funding. Haupert also discussed what he said might be unintended consequences of expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, even though Haupert generally supports the idea.
