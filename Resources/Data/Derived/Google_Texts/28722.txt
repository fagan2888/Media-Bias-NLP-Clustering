The policy director of a local think tank who has spoken with “whistleblowers” says the feds are probing the state Health Connector to see if the Patrick administration misled them about the state’s troubled Obamacare website in order to keep taxpayer funds flowing to Massachusetts.

Joshua Archambault, director of health care policy at the conservative Pioneer Institute, said his group has been in touch with the whistleblowers and is preparing a report, slated for release Monday, based in part on information they provided.
