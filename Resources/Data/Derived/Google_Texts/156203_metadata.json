It is especially scary now, as advances shrink, publishers fight with Amazon, and the death of the novel is forecast with ever-increasing frequency. It\u2019s a time when it would make a lot of sense to quit \u2014 and a time when simply not quitting is becoming its own art form.\n\nThose who leave academia have \u201cquit lit\u201d \u2014 stories of how and why they exited an institution that they felt undervalued them and their work. But many creative writers today seem to be writing what you might call \u201cstay lit\u201d \u2014 accounts of how the publishing world has bruised and sometimes bloodied their egos, and why they\u2019re still writing anyway.\n\nIn an essay recently published on The Rumpus, the novelist Russell Rowland describes being dropped by his agent after years of underwhelming books sales and dwindling advances, the most recent in the two figures. These disappointments weigh on him: \u201cEvery time I get my royalty statements, which come every six months, my resolve gets tested in ways that sometimes take weeks to overcome.\u201d Yet he keeps coming back: \u201cThe desire to write, it seems, is a sickness for which there is no cure. Except writing.\u201d\n\nAlexander Nazaryan sounded a similar note in Salon in 2013, writing that despite many rejections (and a successful career in journalism), he wouldn\u2019t let the dream of being a novelist die:\n\n\u201cThe irony of my predicament is that if I could just wean myself off the novel, I would invariably be happier and healthier, a better husband and a better father. But I cannot do it, and not even failure can check me.\u201d\n\nStay lit is practiced by writers with more success under their belts as well. Emily Gould wrote in Medium about the slow realization that, despite a big advance for her memoir, she wouldn\u2019t be able to support herself with writing:\n\n\u201cIn January 2013 I began a full-time job that, while it leaves me no time to write, is helping me slowly repay the debts I incurred by imagining that writing was my livelihood. Act 1 is over \u2014 it\u2019s been over for a while \u2014 and I\u2019m headed back into the woods.\u201d\n\nAnd \u201cStill Writing,\u201d a 2013 memoir by the popular fiction and nonfiction writer Dani Shapiro, extols the virtues of sitting at your desk and doing the work, even when it feels impossible. She is one of the lucky ones \u2014 she has published seven books, received widespread acclaim, and appeared on television with Oprah. But she told Op-Talk that she felt driven to open up about her writing difficulties too:\n\n\u201cI have this kneejerk desire to be honest about it. It\u2019s never just what it appears to be. Writing lives and writing careers are very hard-won even when they\u2019re successful, and I feel like it\u2019s important to say all that, and to be open about that because otherwise, especially because we all do what we do alone in a room, there\u2019s a tendency to think, Oh, it\u2019s just me.\u201d\n\nFor her, this kind of openness feels especially important at a time when she and many other writers maintain upbeat social media presences that might make things look more effortless than they are: \u201cI know almost no writer who isn\u2019t always kind of scrappily figuring it out, living by our wits in various ways, whether it\u2019s teaching or it\u2019s lecturing or it\u2019s writing for Big Pharma or it\u2019s ghostwriting or it\u2019s doing editorial work, and I just think that that\u2019s important especially in this age of the curated self-image, for people to know.\u201d\n\nKnowing about other writers\u2019 day jobs and setbacks can be demystifying. Marie Mutsuki Mockett, a novelist and nonfiction author who has written about her own struggle to find a publisher, says that \u201cas a younger writer, I felt like there was this magical thing that happened, where you went from really wanting to write and then you had a book.\u201d Reading other authors\u2019 blogs taught her \u201chow writers made what looked like this magical change, how they got their angel wings.\u201d\n\nAnd learning about others\u2019 disappointments might soften the blows of one\u2019s own. Mr. Rowland told Op-Talk that many fellow writers found his story familiar, as even those with long track records, like him, struggle to be read. \u201cWith the major publishers,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s become way more focused on the numbers than it ever was.\u201d However, his confession may have had an unexpected perk: An editor noticed his Rumpus essay and is now reading his manuscript.\n\nSome stay lit is encouraging \u2014 keep going, it\u2019ll happen for you. But it can also be about persevering in the face of the knowledge that \u201cit\u201d \u2014 acceptance, publication, financial success \u2014 may never happen. It can be a way for writers to express their fears the only way they know how: more writing.\n\nHonest writing about the realities of publishing can be sobering in the extreme. Ms. Gould told Op-Talk she hoped her Medium essay gave aspiring writers an understanding of the financial realities of the business: \u201cIt\u2019s good for people to be aware of what the situation really is.\u201d That situation can be harsh, and certainly isn\u2019t for everyone. Of her own journey from disappointing sales to debt and deep career uncertainty, she said: \u201cPeople who get past those sort of demarcations and then continue to do it are crazy, obviously.\u201d\n\nGiven all this, it\u2019s easy to imagine some stay lit actually convincing aspiring writers to quit. But for the truly committed, there may be something redemptive about stories of sticking with it despite lack of recognition or of remuneration. In \u201cStill Writing,\u201d Shapiro writes that \u201cultimately a writer is someone who writes. And a writer who writes is one who finds a way to give herself permission.\u201d\n\nPermission \u2014 that hard-to-describe feeling that you\u2019re allowed to keep writing \u2014 can come from traditional validation. Esm\u00e9 Weijun Wang, a fiction writer and blogger, has written about the agony of seeing that validation go only to others: \u201cdidn\u2019t it mean that I wasn\u2019t fit to be a writer, a real writer, if I wasn\u2019t receiving that permission as well?\u201d But maybe it can also come from seeing others in the same boat as you. These writers have been rejected again and again, and they\u2019re still at it, so maybe it\u2019s O.K. to keep writing in the face of your own setbacks. Maybe you\u2019re not crazy. Or maybe you are, but at least you\u2019re not alone.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140609140820, "BN": "op-talk", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/optalk", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/op-talk/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "June 9, 2014", "keywords": "Deeper Dive", "GBLC": "Deeper Dive", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/op-talk/With \u2018Stay Lit,\u2019 Writers Persevere in a Hostile World ( 20140609 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Anna North", "SCG": "op-talk", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Anna North", "byl": "Anna North", "twitter": {"description": "In a time when the writing life feels more precarious than ever, just sticking with it is becoming its own art form, writes ANNA NORTH.", "title": "With \u2018Stay Lit,\u2019 Writers Persevere in a Hostile World", "url": "http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/with-stay-lit-writers-persevere-in-a-hostile-world/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@nytopinion", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000002928979, "description": "In a time when the writing life feels more precarious than ever, just sticking with it is becoming its own art form, writes ANNA NORTH.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "June 9, 2014", "article": {"section": "Opinion", "tag": "Deeper Dive", "published_time": 1402337300, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2014-06-09T18:34:53-04:00"}, "utime": 20140609183453, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140609, "pdate": 20140609, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Op-Talk", "description": "In a time when the writing life feels more precarious than ever, just sticking with it is becoming its own art form, writes ANNA NORTH.", "title": "With \u2018Stay Lit,\u2019 Writers Persevere in a Hostile World", "url": "http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/with-stay-lit-writers-persevere-in-a-hostile-world/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/with-stay-lit-writers-persevere-in-a-hostile-world/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "With \u2018Stay Lit,\u2019 Writers Persevere in a Hostile World", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "Maybe you\u2019re not crazy.\nBut many creative writers today seem to be writing what you might call \u201cstay lit\u201d \u2014 accounts of how the publishing world has bruised and sometimes bloodied their egos, and why they\u2019re still writing anyway.\nIt can be a way for writers to express their fears the only way they know how: more writing.\nBut I cannot do it, and not even failure can check me.\u201dStay lit is practiced by writers with more success under their belts as well.\nThese writers have been rejected again and again, and they\u2019re still at it, so maybe it\u2019s O.K."}
