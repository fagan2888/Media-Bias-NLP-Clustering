(Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)\n\nThere's a limit to what Sen. Ted Cruz would do to repeal Obamacare.\n\nThe Texas Republican said Monday that Republicans should do \u201ceverything humanly possible to repeal Obamacare\" during a speech at Heritage Action\u2019s annual policy summit. It's a line he's used before. But he later added a caveat.\n\nWhen asked if Republicans should use the \"nuclear option\" to ditch the filibuster on legislation and get more bills to President Obama\u2019s desk, including a bill repealing Obamacare, Cruz told reporters, \u201cno, we should not.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should preserve the procedural protections in the Senate for the rights of the minority,\u201d he said. Borrowing an analogy used by the framers, Cruz said the Senate is \u201clike the saucer under the tea cup to cool deliberations, and I think those checks and balances were inspired. And one of the ways to limit rash decision-making is the requirement in the Senate of a 60-vote threshold to overcome a filibuster.\u201d\n\nSenate Democrats effectively ended the ability of a minority to filibuster nominations except Supreme Court nominees. They did it using the \"nuclear option\" to effectively change Senate rules by overturning the ruling of the chair by a simple majority vote.\n\nThe same process could be used to effectively end the filibuster for legislation, a prospect that was raised during the debate over the nuclear option in 2013, although Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said it will take 60 votes to pass a repeal bill. Cruz is encouraging the use of the budget reconciliation process to use a simple majority to get legislation through the Senate that would undo as much of the health care law as is possible without going to the extreme step of upending rules and precedents.\n\nThat method would get a measure to Obama's desk that could negate huge chunks of the law.\n\nBut that would amount to a lot of trouble just to send a veto-cannon-fodder bill to Obama's desk.\n\nReconciliation bills are immune from a filibuster but require passage of a joint congressional budget resolution, and the legislation is limited to budget-related issues.\n\nIn his speech, Cruz also recommended that Congress get rid of the Internal Revenue Service, a move that Democrats \u2014 and some of his fellow Republicans \u2014 would consider a rash move, although the Republican National Committee has been pushing the same message.\n\nCruz admitted that that was probably unrealistic as long as Obama was in the White House.\n\nCruz also called for increased border security, a more robust energy policy, and reining in the White House, including on the executive action on immigration.\n\nNiels Lesniewski contributed to this report.
