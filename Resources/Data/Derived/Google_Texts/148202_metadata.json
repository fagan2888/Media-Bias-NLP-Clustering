(REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque)\n\n4277507\n\nThe number of uninsured Americans has risen in three states in the first year after Obamacare \u2014 a surprise for both sides of the aisle.\n\nThe uninsured populations in Kansas, Iowa and Virginia have all expanded in the past year, according to a Tuesday Gallup poll. Iowa and Virginia saw smaller increases from 2013 to 2014 of just 0.6 percent and 0.1 percent respectively, but Kansas\u2019s uninsured rate surged upward by 5.1 percent.\n\nIt\u2019s unexpected by almost anyone\u2019s standards \u2014 while conservatives have opposed Obamacare for a host of reasons, even experts that project Obamacare will hike premiums and lower quality expected the law\u2019s mandate to carry coverage to lower the uninsured rate, at least at first. Eventually, University of Minnesota economist Stephen Parente predicts that Obamacare will raise health insurance costs so drastically that it\u2019ll counteract the individual mandate penalty and subsidies for the eligible \u2014 but doesn\u2019t expect that to hit for another several years.\n\nNone of the three states expanded their Medicaid programs through Obamacare, which some liberal commentators have seized as the culprit. But a lack of expansion doesn\u2019t explain the increasing number of uninsured.\n\nThis year, the individual mandate penalty is at its lowest; Obamacare subsidies are in place; and while premiums are growing significantly, they\u2019ll likely only get higher in the future. So in theory, this year had great conditions for lowering the uninsured rate \u2014 and in all other states, the number of uninsured did fall.

While Americans protested the millions of scheduled insurance cancellations, insurers who were promised a larger influx of potential customers on Obamacare exchanges have been hit with a sicker population than they expected as a result, which is likely forcing even higher premium hikes and could make state residents less likely to purchase coverage.\n\nIn Iowa, insurance companies even cited the extension of non-compliant plans as a primary reason for large premium rate hikes.

Obamacare included three risk mitigation provisions to keep insurance companies from hiking premiums drastically out of fear in the first several years that Obamacare is in effect \u2014 but two will run out in 2016.\n\nParente predicts that the country will be in store for dramatic premium increases in 2017, the first year that the risk corridors and the temporary reinsurance programs will no longer be in effect. According to Parente\u2019s data, in 2016, Obamacare will lower the number of uninsured Americans to 30 million, down from the current rate, but will shoot back up to 36.1 million in 2017 when premiums rise.\n\nGallup\u2019s numbers aren\u2019t exact and it\u2019s not clear what could be causing these states uninsured rates to rise, especially as dramatically as Kansas\u2019 has. But it\u2019s clear that customers are being hit with much higher health insurance premiums in the wake of Obamacare \u2014 and that at the same time, Obamacare customers are facing higher out-of-pocket costs and narrower networks. While these states appear to be feeling the brunt of Obamacare earlier than expected, the rest of the country may catch up to them.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "Iowa and Virginia have more uninsured too", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The number of uninsured Americans has risen in three states in the first year after Obamacare -- a surprise for both sides of the aisle.\u00a0    The uninsured populations in Kansas, Iowa and Virginia hav", "title": "After Year One Of Obamacare, Kansas\u2019 Uninsured Rate Is Up Five Percent", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/08/05/after-year-one-of-obamacare-kansas-uninsured-rate-is-up-5-percent/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/2014-06-20T161723Z_1_LYNXMPEA5J0OJ_RTROPTP_4_IRAQ-SECURITY-OBAMA-e1403298314324.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Iowa and Virginia have more uninsured too", "title": "After Year One Of Obamacare, Kansas\u2019 Uninsured Rate Is Up Five Percent Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/08/05/after-year-one-of-obamacare-kansas-uninsured-rate-is-up-5-percent/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/2014-06-20T161723Z_1_LYNXMPEA5J0OJ_RTROPTP_4_IRAQ-SECURITY-OBAMA-e1403298314324.jpg"}, "creator": "@@SarahMHurtubise", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-08-05 18:02:38", "sailthru.title": "After Year One Of Obamacare, Kansas' Uninsured Rate Is Up Five Percent", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "obamacare,sarah-hurtubise", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "obamacare", "sailthru.description": "The number of uninsured Americans has risen in three states in the first year after Obamacare -- a surprise for both sides of the aisle.\u00a0    The uninsured populations in Kansas, Iowa and Virginia hav", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/2014-06-20T161723Z_1_LYNXMPEA5J0OJ_RTROPTP_4_IRAQ-SECURITY-OBAMA-e1403298314324.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "(RELATED: Obamacare Delay Sparks More Premium Hikes In Iowa)But the real premium hikes aren\u2019t even here yet, according to experts.\nSo in theory, this year had great conditions for lowering the uninsured rate \u2014 and in all other states, the number of uninsured did fall.\nGallup\u2019s numbers aren\u2019t exact and it\u2019s not clear what could be causing these states uninsured rates to rise, especially as dramatically as Kansas\u2019 has.\nIn Iowa, insurance companies even cited the extension of non-compliant plans as a primary reason for large premium rate hikes.\nIowa and Virginia saw smaller increases from 2013 to 2014 of just 0.6 percent and 0.1 percent respectively, but Kansas\u2019s uninsured rate surged upward by 5.1 percent."}
