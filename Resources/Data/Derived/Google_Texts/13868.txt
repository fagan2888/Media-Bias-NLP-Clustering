A two-vehicle crash in Shaler has closed down Route 8 between Pennview Avenue and Butler Plank Road, a traffic alert from Shaler police said.

The incident was reported at 2:40 p.m.

Shaler police Lt. Sean Frank said both vehicles were traveling north on Route 8 at Spencer Lane when one switched lanes and there was a collision, causing one to strike a utility pole.

The pole and wires are down on the roadway, and Route 8 will remain closed until the repairs are made. Duquesne Light estimates the repairs will take several hours, the traffic alert said.

Two people, including a juvenile, were injured in the crash. The juvenile was conscious when taken to Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC, and the extent of their injuries is not available at this time, Shaler Lt. Sean Frank said.

The crash is under investigation.

Lt. Frank recommends that motorists try to find an alternate route before getting into the area such as Mt. Royal Blvd.
