The complex\u2019s modular buildings will eventually hold 2,400 detainees, who will technically be in the custody of U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, NPR reports.\n\nThe day-to-day operations of the jail will be handled by Corrections Corp. of America (CCA), the nation\u2019s largest for-profit prison company. But the contract and the money to run it will go to the town of Eloy, Ariz., two states \u2014 about 931 miles \u2014 away. Watchdogs who monitor for-profit immigrant jails say they\u2019ve never seen anything quite like it..\n\nAn ICE spokesman told the network that it was \u201ca creative response to a difficult situation,\u201d meaning it could have taken 18 months to get the facility up and running if the government would have gone through the traditional bidding process.\n\nThe facility is part of a larger plan by President Obama and his Cabinet to respond quickly to the humanitarian crisis at the border. At its peak in June, nearly 26,000 unaccompanied minors and single women with children were caught at the border; most surrendered to Border Patrol agents. Those numbers have dropped dramatically since the summer, but the Central Americans are still coming. Washington wants to send a clear message of deterrence back to Central America: Don\u2019t make the journey. Dilley [the town in which the new facility will be located] is the third new \u201cresidential center\u201d ICE has opened in recent months to detain families and swiftly deport them if their asylum claims fail. The deal between ICE and Eloy is called an Intergovernmental Services Agreement. These types of deals are unique in that they don\u2019t require competitive bidding. In this case, Eloy was already acting as the contractor for a large ICE immigrant jail located in that Arizona city. So last month, the Eloy City Council modified its existing agreement with ICE to add a second detention facility in Texas, also to be managed by CCA.\n\nThe new detention center is not meant to feel like a traditional jail: It will have playrooms, a snack bar, a soccer field and no razor wire on the exterior fence.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to be incarcerated; they\u2019re just going to be detained for a while and then go on to where they\u2019re going,\u201d Frio County Commissioner Pepe Flores told NPR.\n\nThe number of detainees, counting the state prison nearby, will soon constitute half of Dilley\u2019s population. The good news is the new immigrant facility is expected to create 600 jobs, as well as more sales taxes and bigger property tax revenues.\n\n\u201cI know we will be a lot better off financially than Eloy, but Eloy doesn\u2019t have to lift a finger to make that amount of money,\u201d Noel Perez, a Dilley city administrator, told NPR.\n\nLocated between Phoenix and Tucson, Eloy, Ariz., was also a dying little agricultural city when Corrections Corp. of America came to town. Now the private prison giant is the biggest employer in Eloy, with four lockups: three prisons and the Eloy Detention Center, an ICE jail for immigrants.\n\nICE will reportedly send Eloy $290 million for the first year\u2019s expenses of the South Texas facility. The town will pass that payment to the CCA to run the detention center, and the CCA pays Eloy $438,000 a year to act as its accountant.\n\nEloy officials will have nothing to do with operations in Dilley. In fact, they don\u2019t even plan to visit South Texas. (Harvey) Krauss, the city manager, says CCA will represent Eloy and fulfill all the federal rules to ensure detainees are properly cared for.\n\nThe first detainees are expected to be brought to the Dilley detention facility in December.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Construction has begun on the largest immigrant detention facility in the U.S., and according to a report, a small Arizona town will be managing and operating it.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=719630055", "og": {"site_name": "KTAR.com", "description": "Construction has begun on the largest immigrant detention facility in the U.S., and according to a report, a small Arizona town will be managing and operating it.", "title": "Rural Arizona town to manage large federal immigrants' facility in Texas - KTAR.com", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://ktar.com/wp-content/uploads/cms/apimage/22/ap_9505cf8751931b26610f6a706700b488.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-08T08:08:01+00:00", "url": "http://ktar.com/story/93728/rural-arizona-town-to-manage-large-federal-immigrants-facility-in-texas/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "KTAR.com", "description": "Construction has begun on the largest immigrant detention facility in the U.S., and according to a report, a small Arizona town will be managing and operating it.", "creator": "@ktar923", "image": "http://ktar.com/wp-content/uploads/cms/apimage/22/ap_9505cf8751931b26610f6a706700b488.jpg", "title": "Rural Arizona town to manage large federal immigrants' facility in Texas - KTAR.com", "site": "@ktar923", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.jacobsmedia.KTAR", "fb": {"pages": 42794977621, "app_id": 291385034204941}, "keywords": "Phoenix and Arizona Breaking News And News Headlines - Home, Home,92.3 KTAR", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/KTARNews", "section": "Local News", "published_time": "2014-11-08T08:08:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-08T08:08:01+00:00"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "verify-v1": "XrJiQDsWmPaoqGKN0EHKs7ult0rBB0W9zj4cWkAPRVI=", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce7b7\"", "article_summary": "Construction has begun on the largest immigrant detention facility in the U.S., and according to a report, a small Arizona town will be managing and operating it.\nIn this case, Eloy was already acting as the contractor for a large ICE immigrant jail located in that Arizona city.\nThe first detainees are expected to be brought to the Dilley detention facility in December.\nNow the private prison giant is the biggest employer in Eloy, with four lockups: three prisons and the Eloy Detention Center, an ICE jail for immigrants.\nThe good news is the new immigrant facility is expected to create 600 jobs, as well as more sales taxes and bigger property tax revenues."}
