You can defer your loan payments or request forbearance, both of which pause your payments while you look for a way to rebalance your cash flow.\n\nA deferment is a period during which repayment of your student loan principal and interest is temporarily delayed.\n\nWith forbearance, you may be able to stop making payments or reduce your monthly payment for up to 12 months. But, interest will continue to grow.\n\nRelated: The Hidden Reason for the Student Loan Crisis\n\nMissed a student loan payment already?

He graduated from college with $70,000 in student loan bills and opted to defer and forbear his payments. He ended up amassing an additional $30,000 in debt from accumulated interest.\n\nRelated: FBI Warns of New Student Loan Scam\n\nDefer or forbear?\n\nAs a college grad, you typically have a 6-month grace period after graduation before your 1st loan payment is due. After that, if you're unemployed or underemployed, you can explore your repayment options.\n\nDefer your loans. \"You can usually defer your loan repayment for up to 3 years,\" Josuweit says. \"If you have a government loan such as a Perkins loan or a subsidized Stafford loan, the government will pay your interest during the deferment.\"\n\nPrivate lenders have different terms and conditions for deferment, but typically either your interest will accumulate and be added to the principal or you can make interest-only payments.\n\nRequest forbearance. \"Forbearance is usually limited to a particular time period, often in 1-year-long increments,\" Josuweit says. \"There's no interest subsidy with forbearance, so the interest accrues and is recapitalized to your balance and you end up owing more money.\"\n\nPrivate lenders sometimes limit forbearance to 6-month increments, he says.\n\nRelated: There\u2019s a New Way to Reduce Student Loan Payments\n\nQualifying for student loan repayment delays\n\nJosuweit says that private lenders often require you to complete a budgeting exercise to compare your income and expenses to determine whether you can make payments. Federal loans are more discretionary in their evaluation of borrowers. Either way, you have to prove that you have a financial hardship.\n\n\"Ideally, you want to just repay your student loans, but if you can't, deferring a government loan is your best option because the interest will be repaid,\" he says. \"In the worst-case scenario, you can request forbearance, but it's best to get out of that as quickly as possible and get back to making payments.\"\n\nThis piece originally appeared on Bankrate.
