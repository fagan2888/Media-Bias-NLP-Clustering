They will be honoring and supporting those whose lives have been shattered by addiction and remembering those lost. Ceremonies will be hosted by local chapters throughout the United States. On Sept. 13, candles will burn bright as beacons of hope for the 22.7 million Americans addicted to drugs.\n\nThe Addict\u2019s Mom hopes to highlight:\n\nThe lack of available resources specifically structured to care for, curtail, and combat addiction issues.\n\nCampaigns for foundations, such as hospitals, to increase their efforts in treating those plagued by addiction.\n\nInformation that is available to those struggling with addiction about where they can receive help.\n\nThe fact that recovery is possible.\n\nThe need to never lose hope.Lights of Hope is an offer extended to all to step out of the shadows of shame and stigma and raise their voices as one by lighting three candles to spotlight September as National Recovery Month. One candle represents those in active addiction, the next celebrates addicts in recovery, and the last speaks for those who have perished. Together the tapers embody the hope that one day this national epidemic of death and despair will end.\n\n\n\nAn extremely painful and private battle, most addicts and their families suffer alone. Enter Barbara Theodosiou. When she found out that two of her four children had fallen prey to addiction, she knew she had to do something. That something was to announce, very bravely, to the world that she was an addict\u2019s mom and she was not going to hide in shame, but she was going to be there to help every mother like her cope with this beast that was destroying her. Her crusade, now called The Addict\u2019s Mom, a burgeoning Facebook community, is a home for many\u2013a place where mothers share their hopes, fears and grief without shame.\n\n\u201cIt shocks me. It crushes me. It steals my soul. There are no breaks, no holidays, there is no solace here. All I can do now is tell his story to the world in the hopes that I am able to make the smallest change in a broken system that houses the mentally ill in violent jails,\u201d Theodosiou shared.\n\nShe\u2019s not alone anymore. The Addict\u2019s Mom, now 30,000 strong, takes pride in bolstering battered spirits, sharing the miniscule amount of community resources available, and offering support where once there was none\u2014a huge victory", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Addict's Mom announced their nationwide campaign, Lights of Hope, 2015.
