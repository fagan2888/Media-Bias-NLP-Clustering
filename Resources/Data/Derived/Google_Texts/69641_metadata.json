As scores of French troops arrived to help secure the beleaguered capital, Djotodia had urged the ex-Seleka to get off the streets.\n\nHowever, their signature spray-painted pickup trucks bounced Sunday over rutted roads around Bangui, particularly in several predominantly Muslim neighborhoods. Half a dozen ex-Seleka sat near a major hospital with rocket-propelled grenades.\n\nThe French troops are part of a U.N.-sanctioned military intervention launched last week amid deadly sectarian violence in the former French colony.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/WORLD", "dcterms.modified": "2015-01-09 10:49:40 EST", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "twitter": {"description": "The mostly Muslim ex-rebels who control Central African Republic are patrolling neighborhoods across the capital, despite an order to return to their barracks.", "title": "C.
