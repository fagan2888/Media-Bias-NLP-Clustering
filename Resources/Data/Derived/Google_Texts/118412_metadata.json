Schaffer has previously indicated investigators had found something new while investigating Paxton's admission last year that he solicited investment clients for a friend and business partner without properly registering with the state. He was reprimanded and fined $1,000 by the State Securities Board. In May, the special prosecutors won a request to expand the scope of the probe, and most signs pointed to them zeroing in on fraud.\n\nPaxton, meanwhile, has hired attorney and former federal judge Joe Kendall.
