While much of the House committee hearing on Jonathan Gruber was focused on his “stupidity” comments and his character, it was Rep. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) that really brought it home.

Lummis discussed her husband’s death for the first time publicly and sought remind Gruber that his self-described “glib” words and the law that stemmed from them impact real people.

She said that she and her husband were both covered through insurance under the Obamacare exchange, but glitches in the system had seen them be dropped multiple times. Her husband had been having chest pains around this same time that they had only sporadic coverage.

“On October 24, the week before election, my husband went to sleep and never woke up. He had a massive heart attack in his sleep at age 65. A perfectly, by all accounts, healthy man. Come to find out, in a conversation with his physician after he died, he chose not to have one of the tests, the last tests, his doctor told him to have. This happened to coincide with the time that we were told that we were not covered by Obamacare. I’m not telling you that my husband died because of Obamacare. He died because he had a massive heart attack in his sleep.But I am telling you that in the time that he was having tests by a physician and was told we were not covered by Obamacare that he then decided not to have the last test the doctor asked him to have,” Lummis shared.

“Let me suggest that there may be a decline in participation and that it may not be to the benefit to the American people. I want to suggest that, regardless of what happened to me personally, that there have been so many glitches in the passage and implementation of Obamacare that have real-life consequences on peoples’ lives. The so-called glibness that has been referenced today has direct consequences for real American people. So get over your damn glibness.”
