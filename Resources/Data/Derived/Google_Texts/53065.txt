Less than 24 hours after a truck hit a Denver building on Friday night, another truck struck a home Saturday morning.

The incident involved a three-vehicle accident at 7th Avenue and Kalamath Street, Denver police said.

No one inside the home or the vehicle was injured, officials said.

Daniel Mariscal was at his food service job Saturday morning when he got the call from a neighbor that someone had crashed into his home.

The truck didn’t go through the home’s wall, but did cause structural damage, said Denver Fire Assistant Chief Mark Ruzycki. Mariscal and his girlfriend, who also lives in the home, will not be allowed back in their house until city building inspectors give the OK.

“My main concern was my dog,” Mariscal said. “The cage was right next to the wall where the car hit it.”

Mariscal’s pitbull-mix, Kenai, was untouched.

“It’s just a good thing no one was injured,” Mariscal said. “I’m thankful for the first responders who are hard at work.”

The intersection at 7th Avenue and Kalamath Street has been closed, police said.

On Friday night, Denver police responded to West Crestline Avenue and Dover Street where a truck slammed into a residential building.

No injuries were reported in either crash.
