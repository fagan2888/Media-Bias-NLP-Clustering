The chip stores the sensitive data currently recorded on a low-tech, easy-to-copy magnetic stripe, making the cards difficult to counterfeit. By replacing an illegible and meaningless signature with a secret number known only to the legitimate cardholder, the PIN ensures that a lost or stolen card \u2013 or any card where the chip has been circumvented \u2013 is useless.Together, the chip and PIN have reduced credit card fraud 70 percent or more in other countries. A chip alone can\u2019t do that. Without a PIN, a lost or stolen chip card is a bonanza for the person who finds or steals it, just as a magnetic stripe card is today.When it comes to counterfeit cards, the chip can already be disabled, and if criminals aren\u2019t working on a way to counterfeit a working chip they\u2019re falling down on the job.The card industry has come up with a number of excuses for not providing U.S. consumers with both a chip and a PIN.One is that shoppers can\u2019t remember yet another password. That\u2019s an insult to the intelligence of the American consumer, who has been using a PIN at ATM machines for more than 30 years.Another is that there are new technologies on the horizon that will provide even more security than a chip or a PIN. That\u2019s true. But that\u2019s where the drug trial analogy comes in.Yes, someday the advanced technology inside a smartphone, advances in encryption, \u201ctokenization\u201d or some technology yet to be invented will almost certainly make chips and PINs obsolete. Such steps are certainly at the \u201cclinical trials stage.\u201d But that technology isn\u2019t here yet. Chip-and-PIN is.Chip-and-PIN can cure 70 percent of the disease of credit card fraud today. New technology might cure 80 percent, maybe more, a few years from now. But no technology will ever cure 100 percent \u2013 data security is a constant game of leapfrog where criminals respond to a 10-foot fence with a 12-foot ladder. Should a very good solution that works now be withheld during the pursuit of a better solution that might come too late?Chip-and-PIN is proven, tested technology. The infrastructure is in place in more than 80 countries around the world. Under an executive order signed by President Obama, the card industry is required to provide it on credit cards issued to government employees and for use at government facilities that accept credit cards such as national park gift shops.Consumers are those who stand to lose, and they told the National Retail Federation in a new survey that they\u2019d tired of waiting. The survey found that 63 percent of those surveyed believe chip-and-PIN would provide more security than chip-and-signature. And 83 percent of those who think chip-and-PIN is more secure would consider it worthwhile even if they had to remember a different number for each card.If chip-and-PIN is good enough for the rest of the world, why isn\u2019t it good enough for America? Don\u2019t leave the patient to suffer while waiting for the perfect cure when a good cure is at hand.\n\nDuncan is senior vice president and general counsel of the National Retail Federation.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Credit cards around the rest of the world use both a chip and a PIN.", "description": "Credit cards around the rest of the world use both a chip and a PIN.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Credit cards around the rest of the world use both a chip and a PIN.", "title": "US \u2018EMV\u2019 credit cards aren\u2019t the real thing", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/253886-us-emv-credit-cards-arent-the-real-thing", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/253886-us-emv-credit-cards-arent-the-real-thing", "dcterms.date": "2015-09-17T13:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Mallory Duncan", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-17T13:00:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/253886-us-emv-credit-cards-arent-the-real-thing", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Credit cards around the rest of the world use both a chip and a PIN.", "card": "summary", "title": "US \u2018EMV\u2019 credit cards aren\u2019t the real thing"}, "dcterms.title": "US \u2018EMV\u2019 credit cards aren\u2019t the real thing"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd87c\"", "article_summary": "Don\u2019t leave the patient to suffer while waiting for the perfect cure when a good cure is at hand.\nChip-and-PIN is.Chip-and-PIN can cure 70 percent of the disease of credit card fraud today.\nThe chip stores the sensitive data currently recorded on a low-tech, easy-to-copy magnetic stripe, making the cards difficult to counterfeit.\nADVERTISEMENTCredit cards around the rest of the world use both a chip and a PIN, going back more than 20 years in some locations.\nThat\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening in the U.S. credit card market, where the card industry is rolling out new \u201cEMV\u201d cards that include a computer microchip but are refusing to replace the fraud-prone signatures used to approve transactions with a far-more-secure personal identification number."}
