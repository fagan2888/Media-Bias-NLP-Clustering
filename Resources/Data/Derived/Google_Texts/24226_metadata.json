To critics, typical ERs are swamped by the uninsured, who \u2014 lacking a regular doctor or source of care \u2014 go where they will be treated. Performing routine medicine at high prices, ERs are crowded and costly. If the uninsured had insurance, these problems would recede. Better medicine at less cost.\n\nWho could oppose that? Well, nobody. It was a selling point for the Affordable Care Act. The trouble is that the story is mostly make-believe.\n\nJust look at the figures: People with insurance accounted for roughly 80 percent of the 120 million emergency department visits in 2006, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Even if all the uninsured abandoned ERs \u2014 an implausible assumption \u2014 there would still be almost 100 million visits. Actually, there would be more because by 2010 the number of visits had increased to about 130 million.\n\nERs are the black boxes of the U.S. health-care system. From TV hospital dramas, we see them as citadels of chaotic caring. Otherwise, we\u2019re mostly ignorant. The December issue of Health Affairs \u2014 the preeminent journal of health policy \u2014 focuses on ERs and shatters some myths.\n\n\u201cAs recently as the 1950s, the \u2018emergency room\u2019 was often just that \u2014 a hospital room reserved for emergency cases,\u201d writes Arthur Kellermann of the federal Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, with his co-authors. \u201cThe room was staffed by either inexperienced interns or rotating members of the hospital\u2019s medical staff \u2014 regardless of their training, expertise, or interest.\u201d The first residency program in emergency medicine didn\u2019t start until 1970.\n\nWe\u2019ve come a long way from these modest roots. There are now about 5,000 ERs. Large and sophisticated trauma centers handle 50,000 or more patient visits annually. Partly, ERs\u2019 heavy use reflects hospitals\u2019 legal obligation to accept most comers. Reacting to stories of \u201cpatient dumping\u201d \u2014 hospitals rejecting uninsured people with acute symptoms \u2014 Congress in 1986 enacted the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, which requires most hospitals to provide care \u201cin potential medical emergencies,\u201d writes Sara Rosenbaum of George Washington University\u2019s School of Public Health and Health Services.\n\nBut it\u2019s mostly the way medicine is practiced that has expanded the role of ERs. Patients find them a convenient way to get care without making an appointment or skipping work. Doctors, too, increasingly turn to ERs. Kellermann reports that the 4 percent of doctors who run ERs handle 28 percent of acute care cases \u2014 patients with sudden heart, lung and brain problems or serious physical injuries. With appointment-filled days, he writes, few doctors \u201ccan afford to disrupt their routine to see an unscheduled walk-in patient with an urgent problem. It\u2019s much easier ... to direct the patient to a nearby [ER].\u201d\n\nAs a result, ERs serve as gatekeepers, deciding who is admitted to hospitals. Although only 16 percent of their patients are hospitalized \u2014 a share that\u2019s been stable for decades \u2014 they account for half of all hospital admissions. These very sick patients are costly. Other contributors to spending seem smaller. Drug abusers and people with mental illness are often said to overuse ERs and drive up spending. But one study disputes this, finding that these groups represented less than 8 percent of ER visits in New York City.\n\nObamacare notwithstanding, it\u2019s doubtful that overhauling ERs would achieve huge cost savings. To be sure, the system could be run more efficiently and effectively; several studies indicate that. The trouble is that ER costs are relatively modest compared to all U.S. health spending. There are no uniform cost figures, but estimates are in the range of 5 percent. In 2011, this would have been $135 billion out of $2.7 trillion. Shaving 10 percent from that (a generous assumption) would represent one-half of one percent of total spending.\n\nRead more from Robert Samuelson\u2019s archive.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Robert Samuelson, emergency room, emergency care spending, health care system, department of health and human services", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Hospital emergency use is not a major driver of out-of-control health-care costs.", "title": "Robert Samuelson: In health-care spending, myths of the ER", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/robert-samuelson-in-health-care-spending-myths-of-the-er/2013/12/11/5948ce9a-6280-11e3-aa81-e1dab1360323_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/WashingtonPost/Content/Blogs/on-parenting/StandingArt/emergency%20signJPG.JPG", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/robert-samuelson-in-health-care-spending-myths-of-the-er/2013/12/11/5948ce9a-6280-11e3-aa81-e1dab1360323_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Robert Samuelson, emergency room, emergency care spending, health care system, department of health and human services", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "5948ce9a-6280-11e3-aa81-e1dab1360323", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Hospital emergency use is not a major driver of out-of-control health-care costs."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaf3f\"", "article_summary": "Large and sophisticated trauma centers handle 50,000 or more patient visits annually.\nThe December issue of Health Affairs \u2014 the preeminent journal of health policy \u2014 focuses on ERs and shatters some myths.\nThe trouble is that ER costs are relatively modest compared to all U.S. health spending.\nEven if all the uninsured abandoned ERs \u2014 an implausible assumption \u2014 there would still be almost 100 million visits.\nBut one study disputes this, finding that these groups represented less than 8 percent of ER visits in New York City."}
