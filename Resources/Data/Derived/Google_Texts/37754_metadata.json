One of the stores is in Camden, N.J., located across the Delaware River from Philadelphia. The other two are in Cherry Hill and Edgewater Park, which are also in South Jersey.\n\nIn July, Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. (A&P), parent company of Pathmark, decided to close the Pathmark locations in New Jersey because they were not profitable. Former employees of Pathmark as well as locals are feeling sadness and for some, even anger at the store\u2019s closing.\n\n\u201cThis store has been here since 1969, and people have been coming here forever,\u201d Teri Roig, a pharmacy technician who lost her job due to the store\u2019s closing, told the Courier-Post.\n\nSam Ferraino, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1360 in Berlin Township, told the Courier-Post that it was a difficult year for supermarkets, noting that many stores in the area have closed, including two Superfresh stores, a Genuardi\u2019s in Cherry Hill, and an Acme in Glassboro.\n\nOne of Pathmark\u2019s former employees is Ursula Hardy, a 53-year-old mother of five who had worked at Pathmark since she was 22, making $20 an hour with health benefits. But like many other locals, her memories of the store run deep \u2014 it was a neighborhood and community icon in a city that does not have much else left. Camden is notorious for its high levels of unemployment and poverty, and has been designated a \u201cfood desert\u201d by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). A food desert is an area where it\u2019s nearly impossible to eat healthy due to lack of supermarket options.\n\nMany locals will now have to travel farther to find supermarkets, at least until the new ShopRite will open its doors in 2015. Camden\u2019s population of 77,000 had long survived solely on Pathmark for groceries.\n\nFood deserts are more likely to occur in low-income areas, as there are fewer supermarkets per capita in these places. Lacking access to a vehicle and fresh produce have been barriers to healthy eating for the people of Camden and other low-income areas in the U.S. Food deserts have been linked to the obesity epidemic, as people with fewer healthy options are forced to rely on cheap, unhealthy junk food.\n\n\"I'm going to miss the customers, especially the older people,\" Hardy told the Courier-Post. \"Many of them needed help reading their debit cards, or counting their money, because their vision wasn't very good, or they'd need help walking back to their cars. . . . I can't tell you how many funerals I've been to.\"\n\nShe continued, \u201cWe were family here. Of course we\u2019re sad.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "camden supermarket closes, pathmark, food desert, camden", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Pathmark has shut its doors in three South Jersey locations in the wake of a Camden food desert.", "title": "Camden\u2019s Only Supermarket Closes; 238 People Left Jobless In Food Desert", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/camdens-only-supermarket-pathmark-closes-238-people-left-jobless-food-desert-expands-255944", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/07/pathmark.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pathmark has shut its doors in three South Jersey locations in the wake of a Camden food desert.", "title": "Camden\u2019s Only Supermarket Closes; 238 People Left Jobless In Food Desert", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/camdens-only-supermarket-pathmark-closes-238-people-left-jobless-food-desert-expands-255944", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/07/pathmark.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/07/pathmark.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2013-09-07T14:13:27-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-07T14:13:26-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Pathmark has shut its doors in three South Jersey locations in the wake of a Camden food desert."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdac59\"", "article_summary": "According to the Associated Press, the three closing Pathmark supermarkets will leave 238 people jobless.\nCamden's only supermarket is closing, leaving the city that is already known as a \"food desert\" even more barren.\nA food desert is an area where it\u2019s nearly impossible to eat healthy due to lack of supermarket options.\nFormer employees of Pathmark as well as locals are feeling sadness and for some, even anger at the store\u2019s closing.\nCamden is notorious for its high levels of unemployment and poverty, and has been designated a \u201cfood desert\u201d by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)."}
