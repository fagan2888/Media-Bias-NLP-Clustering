Bill Stanley expects that he and Del. Danny Marshall will seek state funding for the planned College of Henricopolis School of Medicine, Stanley said Wednesday.\n\nStanley made the remark while speaking at the Martinsville-Henry County Chamber of Commerce\u2019s post-legislative luncheon at the Virginia Museum of Natural History. Other featured speakers were 9th District U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, Marshall and fellow Delegates Les Adams and Charles Poindexter. All the legislators are Republicans.\n\nStanley, majority whip in the Senate, said the dream of a medical school in Martinsville must become a reality with state support.\n\nMarshall didn\u2019t address the medical school during his comments at the luncheon, but in an interview he said the governor will introduce his proposed budget in December, and legislators can introduce budget amendments when the session convenes in January of next year.\n\nMarshall said he and Stanley have asked Dr. Noel Boaz, president of the medical school, to put together a funding plan, including the total amount needed and how the money would be spent. Marshall said funding may be sought from multiple sources, including the General Assembly, Virginia Tobacco Indemnification and Community Revitalization Commission, the Harvest Foundation and possibly federal funding sources.\n\nAs for the need for the medical school, Marshall referred to a point that Stanley had made. Marshall said: \u201cIf you look at rural Virginia, every two to three doctors who retire, only one is coming back to rural Virginia. We\u2019ve got to turn that around so we can get more doctors in rural Virginia.\u201d\n\nBoaz said after the luncheon that he was glad to hear the support expressed for the planned medical school, which is targeted to open in fall 2016, pending approvals by accreditors.\n\n\u201cI was very pleased with the general amount of support we got,\u201d Boaz said. \u201cSen. Stanley is going to the forefront with this. That is very good. What is unique today, that is new, we are going to have a matching appropriations bill originating in the House with Del. Marshall. This is a significant development.\u201d\n\nBoaz estimates that $24 million to $25 million in funding is needed for the medical school to open, which potentially could come from such sources as the General Assembly, the tobacco commission, private foundations and sale of preferred stock.\n\nDuring his luncheon remarks, Stanley also discussed some of his bills that became law in 2015, including increased funding for rural health care, expanding eligibility for scholarships for medical school students who agree to practice in rural and underserved areas of Virginia, and providing access to a financial literacy course for Virginians who receive public assistance.\n\nHe also mentioned his bill to create the Interstate 73 Transportation Compact between Virginia, South Carolina, North Carolina, West Virginia, Ohio and Michigan to develop and plan for the construction and completion of Interstate 73, to advocate for federal and other funding resources for such projects, and facilitate plans and programs for such projects between those states.\n\nStanley said that despite naysayers, \u201cI say it (I-73) will be built in our lifetime.\u201d He said the project will create tens of thousands of jobs and increase tourism and economic development.\n\nMarshall said the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s proposed regulations for carbon dioxide emission limits for existing electric power plants would put Virginia\u2019s performance emission goals at a more stringent level than some other states, putting Virginia at a disadvantage. He also said several coal-fired power plants in Virginia would have to close, Virginia would have to compete with other states to import electricity, and prices would increase.\n\nIn addition, those proposed EPA regulations are unconstitutional, Griffith said, citing the opinion of legal scholar Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School. Griffith also said he feared the proposed regulations would result in some brownouts.\n\nGriffith said of I-73, \u201cIt\u2019s a huge economic driver,\u201d and he commended local officials for supporting the project. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how proud I am of you,\u201d he said.\n\nAdams talked about various bills that he supported \u2014 as patron, co-patron or committee member. For example, he was chief co-patron of HB 1550, which would make local school boards responsible for setting the school calendar and determining the opening date of the school year, and eliminate the post-Labor Day opening requirement and \u201cgood cause\u201d scenarios for which the Virginia Board of Education may grant waivers of that requirement. The House passed the bill, but it was defeated in a Senate committee, according to the General Assembly website.\n\nAdams said he thinks there is momentum for the bill, and he looks forward to pushing forward with it.\n\nHe also supported a higher education bill to address reporting of on-campus sexual assault. And his HB 1854 was approved. It seeks to prevent nonqualifying corporations from using straw companies to win bids set aside for small, women-owned, and minority-owned businesses, he said.\n\nPoindexter said the state budget approved by the General Assembly during the 2015 session increased funding for state retirement and teacher retirement programs; restored aid to local governments; provided raises for the state work force, teachers and support staff, college faculty, state police, state-supported local deputies, constitutional officers and registrars. It also provided additional funding for health care and the safety net, and increased funding for the rainy-day fund, among other things.\n\nPoindexter said Virginia\u2019s state revenues have been hurt by federal defense cuts and effects of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn interviews, several local officials seemed pleased with the legislators\u2019 remarks.\n\nHenry County Administrator Tim Hall praised the legislators for being responsive to the area\u2019s needs and good to work with. He also said that economically, things \u201care starting to turn around\u201d locally and in the state.\n\nMartinsville Schools Superintendent Pam Heath said: \u201cIt validates things we are trying to do. It\u2019s all about the economy and quality of life. We understand the role of K-12 (education) in that, and that role is very clear to our legislators.\u201d\n\nJoe Keiper, executive director of the Virginia Museum of Natural History, said that anything helping tourism \u201cis important to all museums. I-73 will drive that.\u201d\n\nHe said the legislators are passionate about the area, and he stressed the need for a \u201ccan-do spirit.\u201d\n\nWilliam Wampler, executive director of New College Institute, commended the legislators for \u201cunderstanding the importance of K-12, the community college and NCI working together.\u201d\n\nChamber President Amanda Witt said some of the legislators discussed issues that could impact local businesses, and the chamber is an advocate for local businesses.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "GoDanRiver.com", "description": "State Sen.
