Authorities have found the family of a boy found wandering barefoot in his pajamas along a road early Sunday morning in Pima County.

His parents called 911 to report their 9-year-old autistic son missing, the Pima County Sheriff's Department said. The boy had climbed out of a window and took off.

A couple driving on Valencia Road noticed the boy on the northern shoulder of the roadway near Eagles Talon Parkway between Camino Verde and Ajo Way at around 2:45 a.m.

The couple stopped and called 911.

The boy was about a 1/2 mile away from home. He was wearing Spiderman pajamas and a blue T-shirt imprinted with a skull wearing glasses. He had a Starbucks cup with him.

He wasn't able to communicate with the couple or the investigators.

The child was turned over to the Department of Child Safety. No charges are expected, sheriff's officials said.
