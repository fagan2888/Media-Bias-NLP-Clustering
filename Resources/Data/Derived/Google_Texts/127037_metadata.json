The previous record of four cubes in 1 minute and 30 seconds was set by Spanish cuber David Calvo in 2009.\n\n\"I knew I could do it, so I just had to put my mind to it once I got under water,\" said Brooks, of Brownsville, Texas. \"It's sweet to finally be able to call myself a Guinness world record holder.\"\n\nBrooks said he only started preparing the day before the challenge, but spent nearly the entire day practicing underwater. He said he can definitely solve more than five underwater, but he is happy that he beat the record.\n\nBrooks solved the fifth cube one-handed.\n\nThe competition included categories such as the 2x2x2 cube, the 7x7x7 cube and solving the cube blindfolded.\n\nSam and Tucker Deacon, brothers who were competing in several categories including 2x2x2 and 3x3x3, were practicing before their first national competition.\n\n\"I'm nervous, especially that it's nationals,\" said Sam, 13.\n\n\"Always someone watching,\" said Tucker, 16.\n\nThe championships are one of a series of events at the LSC related to the 40th anniversary of the Rubik's Cube.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "liberty-science-center", "title": "Guinness record for most Rubik's Cubes solved broken at Liberty Science Center", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Guinness record for most Rubik\\u0027s Cubes solved broken at Liberty Science Center\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/08/guinness_record_for_most_rubik.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jersey-journal/photo/2014/08/01/15528802-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13546541\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-08-02T07:00:24Z\", \"author\": \"Nicolas Fernandes | The Jersey Journal\", \"tags\": [\"liberty-science-center\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2014/08/01/15528802-small.jpg", "description": "The Guinness world record for the most Rubik's Cubes solved underwater in one breath was broken by national speed cubing champion Anthony Brooks at Liberty Science Center today.", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, August 02, 2014,  3:00 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2014/08/01/15528802-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"NicolasFernandes\", \"author_nickname\": \"Nicolas Fernandes | The Jersey Journal\", \"author_id\": \"11804890\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Jersey Journal Print Edition\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "The Guinness world record for the most Rubik's Cubes solved underwater in one breath was broken by national speed cubing champion Anthony Brooks at Liberty Science Center today.", "title": "Guinness record for most Rubik's Cubes solved broken at Liberty Science Center", "url": "http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/08/guinness_record_for_most_rubik.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, August 02, 2014,  3:00 AM", "article_author": "Nicolas Fernandes | The Jersey Journal", "Description": "The Guinness world record for the most Rubik's Cubes solved underwater in one breath was broken by national speed cubing champion Anthony Brooks at Liberty Science Center today."}, "article_summary": "The Guinness world record for the most Rubik's Cubes solved underwater in one breath was broken by national speed cubing champion Anthony Brooks at Liberty Science Center today.\nThe championships are one of a series of events at the LSC related to the 40th anniversary of the Rubik's Cube.\n\"It's sweet to finally be able to call myself a Guinness world record holder.\"\nOn the first day of the 10th annual three-day U.S. National Rubik's Cube Championship, Brooks, 20, solved five standard-size cubes in 1 minute and 18 seconds in a 500-gallon water tank.\nBrooks solved the fifth cube one-handed."}
