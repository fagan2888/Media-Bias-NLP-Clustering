This is for those who think Obamacare is so wonderful. As the result of Obamacare, I have lost my oncologist. My cancer treatments will eventually be cut back, and I will not have a good choice of doctors. Medicare is already being cut into, to pay for people who signed up for Obamacare. This is happening to a country that had the best health-care system in the world. This is a real tragedy!
