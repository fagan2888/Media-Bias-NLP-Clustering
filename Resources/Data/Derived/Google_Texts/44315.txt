Martin O'Malley used an Iowa caucus strategy to win support from House Democrats during a Tuesday morning meeting.

The former Maryland governor, facing a room full of lawmakers who are mostly supporting his rival Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, told reporters he asked for members to support him as a second choice.

O'Malley said that he “certainly asked all of the members that if I could not today be their first choice I would like today to be their second choice, so I look forward to their support in the future.”

In the Iowa caucuses, voters often end up supporting a second choice if their first choice is knocked out of the running.
