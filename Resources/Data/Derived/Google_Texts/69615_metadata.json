Lamar Smith, chairman of the Science, Space and Technology Committee, threw cold water Wednesday on President Obama\u2019s Alaska climate-change tour, saying the president\u2019s proposed regulatory fixes have put him on \u201cthin ice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president is on thin ice to claim his costly plan will address climate change or benefit Americans,\u201d said the Texas Republican in a statement.\n\nMr. Obama, who visited Alaska this week for an international climate-change conference, painted climate-driven doomsday scenarios in his remarks, warning that \u201cif we do nothing to keep the glaciers from melting faster, and oceans from rising faster, and forests from burning faster, and storms from growing stronger, we will condemn our children to a planet beyond their capacity to repair.\u201d\n\nClimate-change skeptics have moved to debunk the president\u2019s predictions. In his statement, Mr. Smith said that \u201cthe only thing certain about long-term climate predictions is that they\u2019re certain to miss the mark.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president and his EPA have become traveling salesmen, touring the world to push their extreme climate change agenda,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cBut the science doesn\u2019t support the president\u2019s exaggerated claims linking climate change to severe weather events.\u201d\n\nHe noted that catastrophic hurricanes are on the decline, despite warnings by climate-change alarmists that increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are driving \u201cextreme weather events.\u201d\n\nMr. Smith also argued that the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s recent spate of proposed regulations aimed at combating climate change will do little to lower the temperature while dealing a body blow to the economy.\n\n\u201cEPA\u2019s own data show that its Power Plan regulation would eliminate less than one percent of global carbon emissions and would reduce sea level rise by only 1/100th of an inch, the thickness of three sheets of paper,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cBut it will do lasting damage to our economy, stifle economic growth, destroy jobs and increase energy prices for all Americans.\u201d\n\nAt the three-day GLACIER conference in Anchorage, Mr. Obama told delegates that the \u201ctime to heed the critics and the cynics and the deniers is past.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
