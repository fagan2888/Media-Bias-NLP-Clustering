That is changing quickly as laptops become as common as stethoscopes in exam rooms.\n\nAre my medical records stored electronically?\n\nAt least some of the information you share with your doctor or any hospital or clinic where you've been treated is probably stored on a computer. It's pretty common for most hospitals, clinics and doctors' offices to digitally store your basic information including your name, address and insurance company, the same way many retailers do.\n\nIt's also likely that at least some information about your specific medical conditions is linked to that data. Health care providers have been using computers to help them get paid for decades. That means many computer-generated bills sent to you and/or your insurance company contain medical details like the conditions you were treated for, prescriptions and referrals to specialists.\n\nWhere things are really changing quickly is in the use of electronic records for day-to-day patient care.\n\nUntil recently, most doctors used paper charts to record information generated during patient visits. But the 2009 economic stimulus package offered doctors and hospitals tens of thousands of dollars to help buy computers and software designed to replace paper charts.\n\nAdoption was slow at first, but as of June most hospitals and close to half of all doctors in America report that they are using systems that qualify for those payments. Some are aggressively digitizing older records stored on paper; others are not.\n\nJUST WATCHED Study: Half of all Americans hacked Replay More Videos ...

Nor does it require digital record use.\n\nThe health law does offer bonus payments to health care providers that can prove they're more efficient and not unnecessarily duplicating tests and procedures. Electronic records make that easier.\n\nThe ACA also includes penalties for those who fail to meet performance measures such as keeping people from returning to hospitals because they weren't treated properly the first time.\n\nMore hospitals are starting to use electronic records to track patients, coordinate inpatient and post-hospital care and to record how well they're performing in an effort to win bonuses and avoid penalties put in place by the ACA.\n\nIf electronic medical records are so common, why can't I e-mail my doctor?\n\nSome patients can. But concerns about privacy and payment mean many doctors would rather communicate with patients on the phone or face-to-face.\n\nStandard e-mail isn't secure enough to meet the standards of America's umbrella medical privacy law, known as HIPAA. That's why many doctors don't communicate with patients via e-mail, and continue to send prescriptions and referrals via fax.\n\nSome electronic records systems offer secure \"patient portals\" that allow patients and doctors to communicate electronically. More doctors and hospitals will have to start offering this service if they want to qualify for the maximum amount of stimulus act payments for going digital.\n\nBut not all insurance companies will pay doctors for the time they spend communicating electronically, so many require patients to schedule an office visit instead.\n\nHow secure are my electronic medical records?\n\nAs more doctors and hospitals go digital with medical records, the size and frequency of data breaches are alarming privacy advocates and public health officials. Although health care providers face serious penalties if they allow patients' electronic records to be breached, thieves also have tremendous incentives to get around protections because health records contain so much valuable information.\n\nPrivacy experts argue the health industry has been slow to respond to such incidents by adopting the encryption techniques used for years by financial companies.\n\nIn the recent breach of Community Health System, a hospital chain based in Franklin, Tennessee, Chinese hackers bypassed the hospitals' security systems and stole personal data, including names, Social Security numbers and addresses of 4.5 million patients. Community Health said it would offer identity theft protection to affected patients and carried cyber insurance to mitigate some of its losses.\n\nCan emergency room doctors call up my electronic medical records if I'm in an accident and unable to give them basic information?\n\nProbably not. A major criticism of electronic medical records in America is that the companies that make them have financial incentives to keep them from being easily shared. It's kind of like Windows versus Mac operating systems.\n\nMany companies are trying to win market share by creating software that doesn't \"talk\" to those made by other companies, so if a big hospital uses software from company X, then all the doctors that work with that hospital will have an incentive to buy that software, too.\n\nIf you're unconscious and an ambulance takes you to a hospital you've been to before, they can probably call up their records if you're carrying some kind of identification. But they may not be able to access pertinent information stored on other doctors or hospitals' computers.\n\nSome states have good clearinghouses that allow health care providers to pull in all of a patient's digital health files, but they're still the exception at this point.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Here's what you need to know if your medical records are stored electronically (and they probably are).", "pubdate": "2014-08-21T11:29:27Z", "author": "Eric Whitney, Kaiser Health News", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "Here's what you need to know if your medical records are stored electronically (and they probably are).", "pubdate": "2014-08-21T11:29:27Z", "title": "Are your medical records safe?", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/21/health/medical-records-privacy/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140820151917-electronic-medical-records-t3-entertainment.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "health", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/21/health/medical-records-privacy/index.html"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "template-top": "health,art-img", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}, "keywords": "health, Are your medical records safe?   - CNN.com", "lastmod": "2014-10-13T00:10:45Z", "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140820151917-electronic-medical-records-t3-entertainment.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8347\"", "article_summary": "If electronic medical records are so common, why can't I e-mail my doctor?\nA major criticism of electronic medical records in America is that the companies that make them have financial incentives to keep them from being easily shared.\nHow secure are my electronic medical records?\nCan emergency room doctors call up my electronic medical records if I'm in an accident and unable to give them basic information?\nAre my medical records stored electronically?"}
