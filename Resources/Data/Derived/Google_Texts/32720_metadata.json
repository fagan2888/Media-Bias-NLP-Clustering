Renee Ellmers, R-N.C., declaring that she is officially hunting RINOs, or \u201cRepublicans in name only,\u201d in her bid for Congress.\n\nAnd Daly encourages regular, every-day Americans to join her in running for office to unseat them.\n\nAt stake is the Republican nomination in the Tar Heel State\u2019s second congressional district. Ellmers scored a major upset to win the seat as a tea-party candidate in 2010, but Daly says Ellmers quickly abandoned the principles she espoused while running for office.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the gift that keeps on giving,\u201d said Daly, before listing the issue she thinks ought to disqualify Ellmers from serving another term.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a tax-and-borrow liberal,\u201d Daly explained. \u201cIn her first year in Congress alone, Ellmers voted to increase the debt by more than Hillary Clinton did in eight years as a senator. She refuses to exercise Congress\u2019 purse power to defund Obamacare. She\u2019s an open-borders, pro-amnesty apologist for illegals. She\u2019s the one who tried to kill the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.\u201d\n\nAfter exploring a congressional bid by traveling throughout the district, Daly said the GOP-heavy district is ready for a change.\n\n\u201cThey cannot wait to get a conservative, a real conservative, into office,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can\u2019t wait for the election. Most of them, when they found out I was even considering it, they were saying, \u2018Please run. Please.\u2019 [Ellmers] is someone who comes back to the district and gets in arguments with her constituents. It\u2019s all over YouTube.\u201d\n\nDaly, whose first ad shows her firing a gun and saying, \u2018I\u2019m hunting RINOs\u2019 says the recent actions by the Republican Congress show there needs to be new blood in the majority.\n\n\u201cWhat we have too many of in Congress are millionaires who don\u2019t do their jobs,\u201d Daly said. \u201cWhat we have too few of are folks with titanium spines and political courage. What we need are folks who can go to Washington and actually remember they\u2019re conservatives and actually vote their districts.\u201d\n\nListen to the WND/Radio America interview with Kay Daly:\n\nThere\u2019s more than one challenger to Ellmers from the conservative side. Jim Duncan entered the race earlier this year, touting himself as the antidote to Ellmers. Daly said she looks forward to a spirited campaign and hopes Duncan will endorse her in the run-off against Ellmers following the March 2016 primary.\n\nDaly said she can better make the case as the conservative challenger to Ellmers because of a lifetime of principled activism.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got 30 years worth of a conservative record that I don\u2019t think Jim has if one looks closely at his record,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve worked for (former Texas Sen.) Phil Gramm. I\u2019ve got the support of people like Jim Dobson and Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like Ted Cruz said, \u2018Where have you led and where have you bled?'\u201d she said.\n\nDaly calls her time in Gramm\u2019s office a Ph.D-level experience in understanding what public service is all about. She said the lessons learned there stand in stark contrast to the way Ellmers views her job.\n\n\u201cHe told me time and time again, \u2018Remember who you work for.\u2019 What I\u2019m remembering first and foremost is, \u2018Remember who your boss is.\u2019 It\u2019s the people of the second district,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat my opponent said was after she got there was, \u2018Oh, my boss is John Boehner.'\u201d\n\nSpeaking before Boehner\u2019s Friday announcement of his pending retirement, Daly said she flatly would not back Boehner or other members of the current House leadership for re-election, and she says they will have no influence on her votes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go to Washington. I\u2019m going to stand on principle. John Boehner, Kevin McCarthy and the rest of them aren\u2019t going to change my mind for anything,\u201d said Daly, insisting she will not play their game of voting on bills minutes after they are made available for review.\n\n\u201cIf a thousand-page bill is handed to me half an hour before the vote, I\u2019m going to use the Sen. Mike Lee rule and vote no,\u201d Daly said.\n\nSeveral issues will be front and center for Daly if she is elected to Congress, starting with government spending.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at my three children, it\u2019s something that is untenable. That\u2019s something that has to be gotten into hand right away,\u201d she said.\n\nImmigration is another front-burner issue.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t afford to take in everybody anymore,\u201d Daly added. \u201cThis is the greatest country in the world, and we are the most generous country in this world. But the answers Washington has come up with are just completely out of touch with what the rest of the world is feeling. Too many people are out of work too many people are in trouble out there. We have to take care of our own right now.\u201d\n\nSocial issues also matter a great deal to her, especially protecting the unborn and traditional marriage.\n\n\u201cThese issues are near and dear to my heart,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be fighting for the unborn and fighting to get our courts back in line.\u201d\n\nAs for her beef with RINOs, Kay said: \u201cFolks are fed up. What we have seen out here in real America is folks are tired of Washington telling them what to do, telling them that they know their lives.\u201d\n\nShe called on every-day Americans to join her in her fight to restore sanity to Washington.\n\n\u201cWe need to have more folks in Congress who are moms, who are the baker down the street, the guy from your auto shop. We need folks who are just regular Americans running for office. That\u2019s what I am. I\u2019m a mom. I\u2019m a housewife. I had my own business. This is what we need.\u201d\n\nDaly lives in Moore County with her three kids and husband, who is an attorney, disabled America veteran and former chief of staff for a U.S. congressman.\n\nMore information on Daly\u2019s campaign can be found at KayDaly.com.\n\nView Daly\u2019s first campaign ad, below.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Conservative activist Kay Daly is taking aim at incumbent GOP Rep.
