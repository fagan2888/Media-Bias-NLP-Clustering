They\u2019ve been telling us everyday since the first of the year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt has unleashed a runaway EPA that has been stretching the law, and in some cases, breaking it in order to consume control over the local economic development across America,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe administration has given us a Labor Department and a National Labor Relations Board that are against American job creators and in favor of their union benefactors, who now represent just 6.6 percent of the private work force, and so many regulators have been turned loose on our financial sector that banks have been distracted from their principal purpose: to provide credit and services that enable our businesses to grow and our entrepreneurs to thrive,\u201d Donohue said.\n\n\n\nHe said every day businesspeople at large and small companies wake up each day wondering what the government will do to them today.\n\nDonohue said compliance with Obamacare costs companies \u201ca small fortune, and is significantly driving up overall health care costs.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you add together Americans who can\u2019t find jobs, who can\u2019t find full-time work, or who have given up looking, we\u2019re talking about nearly 10 percent of American workers,\u201d Donohue said.\n\n\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the workforce participation rate is at a four-decade low. That plus the failure of Congress to pass common-sense immigration reform means that we are not only in a nation that \u2026 have people without jobs, but we have so many jobs in critical areas without people,\u201d said Donohue.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the federal government that concerns the business community,\u201d Donohue said. \u201cState and local governments are piling new mandates, taxes and costs on the backs of the private sector.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have an abusive enforcement system at the federal level and in many states that is extorting billions of dollars from companies with little or no due process,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, governments at all levels are accumulating massive levels of debt and unfunded pension and entitlement liabilities. One day, unless there is reform, this whole house of cards can collapse,\u201d Donohue said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "In a State of American Business address, U.S. Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Thomas Donohue said Thursday that the Obama administration is on a \u201cregulatory tear\u201d that will continue until President Barack Obama leaves the White House.", "title": "Chamber of Commerce: Administration on a \u2018Regulatory Tear\u2019 Til the Moving Van Backs Up to the White House Door", "url": "http://cnsnews.com/news/article/melanie-hunter/chamber-commerce-administration-regulatory-tear-will-continue-until", "image": "//cdn.cnsnews.com/chamber_of_commerce.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-14T15:52:54-05:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-14T14:13:12-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-14T15:52:54-05:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "In a State of American Business address, U.S. Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Thomas Donohue said Thursday that the Obama administration is on a \u201cregulatory tear\u201d that will continue until President Barack Obama leaves the White House.", "title": "Chamber of Commerce: Administration on a \u2018Regulatory Tear\u2019 Til the Moving Van Backs Up to the White House Door", "url": "http://cnsnews.com/news/article/melanie-hunter/chamber-commerce-administration-regulatory-tear-will-continue-until", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.cnsnews.com/chamber_of_commerce.jpg"}, "site": "@cnsnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "In a State of American Business address, U.S. Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Thomas Donohue said Thursday that the Obama administration is on a \u201cregulatory tear\u201d that will continue until President Barack Obama leaves the White House.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe current administration is on a regulatory tear, and this will continue \u2018til the day the moving van backs up to the door at the White House next January,\u201d said Donohue.\nU.S. Chamber of Commerce CEO and President Thomas Donohue (AP Photo)(CNSNews.com) \u2013 In a State of American Business address, U.S. Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Thomas Donohue said Thursday that the Obama administration is on a \u201cregulatory tear\u201d that will continue until President Barack Obama leaves the White House.\nOne day, unless there is reform, this whole house of cards can collapse,\u201d Donohue said.\nHe said every day businesspeople at large and small companies wake up each day wondering what the government will do to them today.\n\u201cState and local governments are piling new mandates, taxes and costs on the backs of the private sector."}
