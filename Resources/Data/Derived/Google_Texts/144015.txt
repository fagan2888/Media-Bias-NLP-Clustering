Authorities say a man knew the two gunmen who shot at him outside a suburban Kansas City mall.

The man wasn't hit, and Overland Park police stressed in a news release Sunday that the gunfire wasn't random. The shots were fired Saturday night at Oak Park Mall as the man walked toward his vehicle, which was parked near a Macy's store. The man, who is in his 20s, fled in his car and later contacted police.

Police say they are in the process of obtaining video surveillance and plan to release suspect photos Monday. Anyone with information is urged to call authorities.
