A copy of the Healthcare Bill of Rights bearing AFT\u2019s logo is posted on the LGBT HealthLink website.\n\nAccording to AFT and LGBT HealthLink, it may be illegal for hospitals and other health-care providers to refuse a man access to a women\u2019s restroom if he identifies himself as female.\n\n\u201cIf a provider refuses to let you use the gender-based facilities of your choice based on your gender identity, it could amount to discrimination on the basis of sex, and thus be illegal under the Affordable Care Act,\u201d LGBT HealthLink explains.\n\nThe singularly named Scout, director of LGBT HealthLink, cited this explanation when contacted for confirmation that \u201cgender-based facilities\u201d include men\u2019s and women\u2019s restrooms. The nonprofit encourages individuals who feel they have been discriminated against to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\u201cAlso keep in mind that you may have additional protections under state or local law; for example, in Washington DC, the Human Rights Commission helps ensure that transgender individuals have appropriate access to restrooms,\u201d LGBT HealthLink\u2019s website adds.\n\nIn a Jan. 6 release announcing its endorsement of the Healthcare Bill of Rights, AFT wrote, \u201cunder the Affordable Care Act, discrimination on the basis of sex is prohibited. If a medical provider refuses to recognize a person\u2019s gender identity, the patient can file a discrimination complaint with the Department of Health and Human Services.\u201d\n\nWatchdog contacted multiple state AFT chapters and the union\u2019s Washington, D.C. headquarters to ask whether this principle should apply to restrooms in public schools and elsewhere. AFT leaders in Texas and Georgia indicated they were unfamiliar with the Healthcare Bill of Rights, and AFT headquarters failed to respond to a request for comment.\n\nAlthough endorsing the Healthcare Bill of Rights is consistent with AFT\u2019s \u201cprogressive\u201d politics, it\u2019s unknown how the union chose to do so and how national AFT leadership informed state and local affiliates of the decision.\n\n\u201cA transgender person should use the restroom that corresponds to his or her gender identity,\u201d LGBT legal nonprofit Lambda Legal asserts. The group points to laws in Washington, D.C., and elsewhere as \u201cmodel restroom access policies.\u201d\n\nLambda Legal also opines, \u201ccourts have increasingly found that discrimination against transgender people is sex discrimination, so it\u2019s not acceptable to institute different kinds of bathroom rules for transgender and non-transgender people.\u201d\n\nRyan Anderson, William E. Simon Fellow in Religion and a Free Society at the conservative Heritage Foundation, disagrees.\n\n\u201cThe government shouldn\u2019t force decisions on which bathroom people use based on \u2018gender identity,'\u201d Anderson said in an email to Watchdog.org. \u201cCitizens should be free to make their own bathroom policies based on biological sex.\u201d\n\n\u201cBathroom policies based on biology should not be deemed \u2018discrimination\u2019 by the government,\u201d Anderson added.\n\nA CBS News poll conducted last spring found 59 percent of Americans were opposed to letting boys use girls\u2019 restrooms and letting girls use boys\u2019 restrooms at school.", "article_metadata": {"description": "American Federation of Teachers recently endorsed a transgender advocacy campaign asserting men should be permitted in women's restrooms, and vice versa.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "American Federation of Teachers recently endorsed a transgender advocacy campaign asserting men should be permitted in women's restrooms, and vice versa.", "title": "Does this teachers' union want boys in girls' restrooms? - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/01/male-female-clipartsco.gif", "updated_time": "2015-02-04T09:38:57+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/195485/union-boys-restrooms/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "American Federation of Teachers recently endorsed a transgender advocacy campaign asserting men should be permitted in women's restrooms, and vice versa.", "title": "Does this teachers' union want boys in girls' restrooms? - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/01/male-female-clipartsco.gif"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Education", "published_time": "2015-02-03T04:00:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-04T09:38:57+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "AFT, American Federation of Teachers, LGBT HealthLink, Healthcare Bill of Rights, LGBT Healthcare Bill of Rights, restroom equality, restroom access, Lambda Legal, Heritage Foundation"}, "article_summary": "A CBS News poll conducted last spring found 59 percent of Americans were opposed to letting boys use girls\u2019 restrooms and letting girls use boys\u2019 restrooms at school.\nA copy of the Healthcare Bill of Rights bearing AFT\u2019s logo is posted on the LGBT HealthLink website.\nThe singularly named Scout, director of LGBT HealthLink, cited this explanation when contacted for confirmation that \u201cgender-based facilities\u201d include men\u2019s and women\u2019s restrooms.\nThe public policy position taken by AFT, America\u2019s second-largest teachers union, could have major implications for school children across the country.\n\u201cA transgender person should use the restroom that corresponds to his or her gender identity,\u201d LGBT legal nonprofit Lambda Legal asserts."}
