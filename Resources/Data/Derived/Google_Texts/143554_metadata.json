Despite intemperate outbursts against minorities, dubious promises about \u201cfixing\u201d a country he describes as \u201ccrippled,\u201d and a habit of taunting his opponents with middle school-level insults, Donald Trump has consistently led the GOP in the polls and been described almost universally as the party\u2019s frontrunner.\n\nUntil now. Today, Trump is trailing in a closely watched average of national polls; moreover, the guy who\u2019s beating him isn\u2019t even campaigning right now.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why Trump Is Still Ahead, Despite Carson\u2019s Surge\n\nOn Wednesday, the release of a new national Quinnipiac poll pushed retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson ahead of Trump, 25.3 to 24.3 in the polling average maintained by the website Real Clear Politics. The RCP average has become the de facto standard for gauging the state of the horserace in a campaign where participation in the all-important candidate debates is determined by polling averages.\n\nWere the tables turned, Trump would undoubtedly be shouting the results from the digital rooftops via Twitter and Instagram. Carson, though, has been relatively quiet. His website and Twitter account linked to stories about the polling averages, but other than that, the Detroit native has been relatively quiet.\n\nThat\u2019s because, unlike Trump, Carson isn\u2019t on the campaign trail, at least in any official sense. He has, instead, \u201csuspended\u201d his campaign while on a tour promoting his most recent book, A More Perfect Union: What We the People Can Do to Reclaim Our Constitutional Liberties.\n\nThe Quinnipiac Poll actually showed Trump leading Carson by a single percentage point, but because of the way RCP calculates its averages (it appears to use the four most recent major national polls conducted by four distinct polling organizations) the appearance of the Quinnipiac poll knocked out a mid-October survey by Monmouth University, in which Trump led Carson by 10 percent.\n\nRelated: Megyn Kelly to GOP \u2013 No Foot Massages on Network TV\n\nThe result was a 1.3 percent increase in Carson\u2019s average and a 1.0 percent decline in Trump\u2019s, enough to put the famous neurosurgeon ahead of the billionaire former reality television star, on average, for the first time in the contest.\n\nLike Carson, Trump also has a book, Crippled America: How to Make America Great Again. However, rather than suspend his campaign to promote it, he has integrated the book into the campaign.\n\nTrump\u2019s immediate response to the growing challenge from Carson \u2013no surprise here \u2013 has been to go on the attack. In a Wednesday morning interview with CNN, he said that Carson would be unable to address the country\u2019s fiscal problems (\u201cCarson does not have the mentality to do that. He has no chance\u201d), and he\u2019s unable to deal with world leaders (\u201cBen will not be able to deal with China. He will not be able to deal with Iran. He will not be able to deal with any of the countries that are really abusing our country.\u201d).\n\nRelated: Could Bill Clinton Be President Again? Here\u2019s a Scenario for Bill\u2019s Third Term\n\nTrump also took a shot at Carson\u2019s extremely low-key personality, comparing him to former Florida governor Jeb Bush, who Trump has repeatedly slammed as a \u201clow-energy candidate.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrankly, when you talk about energy, [Carson\u2019s] got lower energy than Jeb Bush,\u201d he told host Chris Cuomo. \u201cIf Ben got in you would say, \u2018Oh, my God. We have ourselves a problem.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump even went after Carson for suggesting that Trump\u2019s upcoming gig as host of Saturday Night Live is beneath the office he\u2019s seeking.\n\n\u201cBen Carson would have done it in two seconds if they asked him,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut if they asked him, nobody would watch. So they wouldn\u2019t ask him.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "One-time GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump is now trailing in a widely watched average of national polls \u2013 to a candidate who isn\u2019t even on the campaign trail.", "title": "Donald Trump Is Now Losing to a Guy Who Isn\u2019t Even Trying", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/04/Donald-Trump-Now-Losing-Guy-Who-Isn-t-Even-Trying", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-carson_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/04/Donald-Trump-Now-Losing-Guy-Who-Isn-t-Even-Trying", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-carson_1.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "One-time GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump is now trailing in a widely watched average of national polls \u2013 to a candidate who isn\u2019t even on the campaign trail.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s because, unlike Trump, Carson isn\u2019t on the campaign trail, at least in any official sense.\nLike Carson, Trump also has a book, Crippled America: How to Make America Great Again.\nToday, Trump is trailing in a closely watched average of national polls; moreover, the guy who\u2019s beating him isn\u2019t even campaigning right now.\nWhen he entered the GOP presidential nomination contest over the summer, Donald Trump rocketed to the top of the polls almost immediately, and there he stayed.\nWere the tables turned, Trump would undoubtedly be shouting the results from the digital rooftops via Twitter and Instagram."}
