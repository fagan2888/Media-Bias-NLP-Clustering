St. Andrews State Park will look more appealing after Saturday.

It was the Comcast Care Day Coastal Cleanup at St. Andrews Park.

The cleanup was to celebrate Earth Day, and keep the park clean; especially after spring break.

For every volunteer who signed up, Comcast donated money to the Friends Of St. Andrews Park Inc., to help them financially with park renovations.

Dozens of volunteers picked up garbage around the park, and the Panama City Dive Club gathered garbage underwater.

â€œThis is really cool that is was put together that we could all come out here and dive and get things donated," said Robert Worcester, a member of Dive Club. "The President of the Dive club, Charles the one who sent us all the invite, and we thought it was for a good cause, because its good to keep the beach clean and help out."

This was the second year Comcast partnered with Friends Of St. Andrews State Park.

Over 400 people volunteered at Saturday's event.
