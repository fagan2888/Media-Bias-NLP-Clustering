Most of them were sedentary or did moderate exercise no more than twice a week, but had no signs of osteoporosis or medical conditions that would make more intense workouts dangerous.\n\nWomen assigned to the three exercise groups did six weeks of moderate activity before scaling up to more intense supervised workouts. Balance exercises included jumping, while strength training was designed to bolster muscle and bone.\n\nAfter five years of follow up, 61 women had a total of 81 fall-related injuries. Half of the women assigned no exercise at all experienced at least one fall.\n\nCompared to women who didn\u2019t exercise, the participants who did combined balance and strength training had a 51 percent lower risk of fall-related injuries and were 74 percent less likely to experience fractures, the study found.\n\nDoing only balance workouts, or just strength training, didn\u2019t appear to reduce the risk of injuries or fractures.\n\nBecause the study only reviewed data on falls women reported to healthcare providers, it\u2019s possible some falls or injuries might have been missed, the researchers acknowledge in the journal Age and Ageing.\n\nEven so, the findings add to a growing body of research demonstrating that exercise can make falls less likely and less dangerous, said Dr. Elizabeth Joy, medical director for clinical outcomes research at Intermountain Healthcare in Salt Lake City.\n\nThe trouble with exercise is too few older people do it, said Joy, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. Only around one in 10 adults over age 65 get enough physical activity, she said.\n\nOlder adults are also susceptible to a condition known as sarcopenia, or loss of muscle mass, which leads to diminished strength and endurance. This, combined with age-related hearing or vision loss can make falls more likely, Joy said by email.\n\nResistance training increases muscle mass, improving strength, endurance and power, which in turn, can make injuries from falls less likely, she said. Even low-impact workouts like walking and Tai Chi can help.\n\n\u201cYou are never too old to start,\u201d Joy said.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/GERIATRIC HEALTH,/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/NUTRITION and FITNESS/Nutrition", "dcterms.modified": "2015-06-05 07:38:25 EDT", "dcterms.abstract": "Elderly women who start exercising regularly may be able to reduce their risk of falls that result in broken bones or other serious injuries, a small study suggests.", "twitter": {"description": "Elderly women who start exercising regularly may be able to reduce their risk of falls that result in broken bones or other serious injuries, a small study suggests.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2015/06/05/elderly-women-who-start-exercising-may-break-fewer-bones.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/health/2015/06/05/elderly-women-who-start-exercising-may-break-fewer-bones/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-1.img.jpg/0/0/1422496010276.jpg?ve=1", "title": "Elderly women who start exercising may break fewer bones", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/GERIATRIC HEALTH\",\"/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/NUTRITION and FITNESS/Nutrition\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"health\",\"title\":\"Elderly women who start exercising may break fewer bones\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/health/2015/06/05/elderly-women-who-start-exercising-may-break-fewer-bones/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-1.img.jpg/0/0/1422496010276.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-06-05T11:33:56Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/health/2015/06/05/elderly-women-who-start-exercising-may-break-fewer-bones.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"afdf2457-855f-4b98-b6e2-fdb6ec8de4dc\",\"section\":\"health\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "Elderly women who start exercising regularly may be able to reduce their risk of falls that result in broken bones or other serious injuries, a small study suggests.", "dc.identifier": "afdf2457-855f-4b98-b6e2-fdb6ec8de4dc", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "classification-isa": "gerihlth,nutrition", "description": "Elderly women who start exercising regularly may be able to reduce their risk of falls that result in broken bones or other serious injuries, a small study suggests.", "prism.section": "health", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "Reuters", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Elderly Women Who Start Exercising May Break Fewer Bones", "dcterms.created": "2015-06-05 07:38:25 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "Elderly women who start exercising regularly may be able to reduce their risk of falls that result in broken bones or other serious injuries, a small study suggests.", "title": "Elderly women who start exercising may break fewer bones | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2015/06/05/elderly-women-who-start-exercising-may-break-fewer-bones.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/health/2015/06/05/elderly-women-who-start-exercising-may-break-fewer-bones/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-1.img.jpg/0/0/1422496010276.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2015-06-05", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/GERIATRIC HEALTH\",\"/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/NUTRITION and FITNESS/Nutrition\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"health\",\"title\":\"Elderly women who start exercising may break fewer bones\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/health/2015/06/05/elderly-women-who-start-exercising-may-break-fewer-bones/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-1.img.jpg/0/0/1422496010276.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-06-05T11:33:56Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/health/2015/06/05/elderly-women-who-start-exercising-may-break-fewer-bones.html\",\"post_id\":\"afdf2457-855f-4b98-b6e2-fdb6ec8de4dc\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"health\"}"}, "article_summary": "Elderly women who start exercising regularly may be able to reduce their risk of falls that result in broken bones or other serious injuries, a small study suggests.\nDoing only balance workouts, or just strength training, didn\u2019t appear to reduce the risk of injuries or fractures.\nAt the start of the study, the women were 70 to 78 years old and living at home.\nBalance exercises included jumping, while strength training was designed to bolster muscle and bone.\nWomen assigned to the three exercise groups did six weeks of moderate activity before scaling up to more intense supervised workouts."}
