But in over half of these cases, it\u2019s driving without insurance \u2013 and not inexperience or incompetence \u2013 that\u2019s to blame.\n\nAccording to shocking statistics obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, driving without insurance is the most common reason for drivers getting banned in their first two years as licence holders.\n\n\u2022 Diesel car pollution is 25 times over legal limit\n\nThat blatant rule-flouting earns new drivers six penalty points \u2013 enough to automatically revoke their licence in their first two years on the road.\n\n10,000 newly qualified drivers banned every year\n\nIn total, around 10,000 newly qualified drivers are banned each year but 21,148 of the 40,481 total since June 2010 had licences revoked due to driving uninsured, according to data from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).\n\nAA President Edmund King says some may have been caught \u2018fronting\u2019, where a high-risk motorist avoids costly premiums by appearing as a named driver on someone else\u2019s policy, when they are actually the main driver.\n\nAs King warned: \u201cThere is still a hardcore of drivers who are uninsured \u2013 usually young men who often have a string of offences to their names and may not even have a licence.\u201d Yet the Department For Transport argues these are the \u201cirresponsible minority\u201d, and says the current legislation is keeping the issue in check.\n\n\n\n\n\nUninsured driver numbers have fallen since 2005\n\nContinuous Insurance Enforcement means drivers now have to officially declare cars off-road (via SORN) to avoid paying for cover. And ANPR cameras cross-check vehicles to see if they appear on the insurance database.\n\n\u2022 Police spend \u00a3127million on car maintenance\n\nHowever, the number of uninsured young drivers has dropped significantly since 2005, says the Motor Insurers\u2019 Bureau (MIB). One in five drivers aged 17-20 was uninsured then, compared to one in 17 now.\n\nDespite this, the Association of British Insurers wants longer learning periods and tighter restrictions for the newly qualified, such as a limit on passenger numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 reasons for new driver bans\n\n1. Not having insurance cover\n\n\n\nBetween June 2010 and May 2014, a total of 21,148 newly qualified drivers were caught using a vehicle uninsured against third-party risks.\n\n2. Speeding\n\n7,220 new drivers banned for speeding on a public road.\n\n3. Driver\u2019s identity\n\nFailure to give information as to the identity of the driver accounted for 2,220 bans.\n\n4. Vehicle control\n\n1,766 bans related to breach of requirements as to control of a car \u2013 using a mobile etc.\n\n5. Care and attention\n\nDriving without due care and attention brought 1,675 bans.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. M-way speeding\n\nAnother 1,249 were down to exceeding motorway limit.\n\n7. Jumping lights\n\nFailing to comply with traffic light signals brought 1,020.\n\n8. Defective tyres\n\n854 were banned for using a vehicle with defective tyre(s).\n\n9. Insurance offence\n\nDifferent insurance offences accounted for 699 bans.\n\n10. Failing to stop\n\n665 drivers were banned for not stopping after accidents.\n\nWhat do you think about the number of new drivers on the road without insurance?
