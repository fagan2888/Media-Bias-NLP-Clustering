And this year he is taking along advocates from around the country. As marchers filed out of town yesterday to start the arduous journey they wore shirts advertising their home states. A team of advocates travelled from Texas, some came from West Virginia and Alabama, a rural hospital CEO from Kentucky joined the walk, as did a woman from Seattle, Washington.\n\nThe message of the marchers is clear: we must save rural health care.\n\nA key part of that agenda includes expanding Medicaid, as an Episcopal priest from Belhaven reminded the audience during a prayer before the send off. Rev. William Barber from the NC NAACP noted that Jesus made health care a central part of his ministry.\n\nYou can follow the march at this website. You can also tweet with the hashtag #savethe283. That refers to a national estimate that 283 rural hospitals are at risk of closing this year.\n\nYou can also join the final rally as marchers reach Washington, DC, and gather at the Capitol on June 15 at 10am.\n\nAnd, finally, you can ask legislators and the Governor in North Carolina to accept new federal Medicaid funds to expand insurance coverage to 500,000 more people in our state.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb002\"", "article_summary": "You can also join the final rally as marchers reach Washington, DC, and gather at the Capitol on June 15 at 10am.\nOn Monday, June 1, O\u2019Neal left Belhaven to replicate last year\u2019s feat.\nThe message of the marchers is clear: we must save rural health care.\nWilliam Barber from the NC NAACP noted that Jesus made health care a central part of his ministry.\nAs marchers filed out of town yesterday to start the arduous journey they wore shirts advertising their home states."}
