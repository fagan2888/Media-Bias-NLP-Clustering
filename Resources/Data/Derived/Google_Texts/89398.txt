Historians have pointed to a variety of factors to explain the collapse of the Roman Empire. They’ve cited foreign invasions, an overstretched military, political and economic instability, and the rise of Christianity, to name a few. But Tea Party hero and potential 2016 presidential candidate Ben Carson his his own theory: it was political correctness that contributed to Rome’s fall, and it could lead to America’s.

Carson expanded on the notion in an interview with Bloomberg Politics’ Phil Mattingly. “For Carson,” Mattingly writes, “the canary in the American coalmine is political correctness.”

“The reason that is very troubling to me,” Carson explains, “is that it’s the very same thing that happened to the Roman Empire. They were extremely powerful. There was no way anybody could overcome them. But these philosophers, with the long flowing white robes and the long white beards, they could wax eloquently on every subject, but nothing was right and nothing was wrong. They soon completely lost sight of who they were.”
