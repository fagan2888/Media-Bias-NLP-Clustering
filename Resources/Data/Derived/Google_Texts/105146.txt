Darius Rainey, Tyler Smith

Two suspects are jailed in the death of a Pittsburg State University student.

Darius Euell Rainey, 21, and Tyler Dornez Smith, 24, were arrested Friday on suspicion of first-degree murder in the death of 20-year-old Taylor C. Thomas and several other felonies. The Joplin Globe reports that both suspects are from Pittsburg.

An autopsy showed that Thomas died of a single gunshot wound. He was a junior at Pittsburg State majoring in mechanical engineering technology.

Officers responding to a disturbance call at an off-campus home where Thomas lived found him wounded around 2 a.m. Thursday. He was pronounced dead at Via Christi Hospital.

Police Maj. Brent Narges says Thomas was shot while inside the home.
