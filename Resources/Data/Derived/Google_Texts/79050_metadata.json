When she and colleagues compared the skeleton's DNA obtained from the ground-up powder of one tooth and a leg bone to samples provided by a 14th cousin on Richard's maternal side, they found a perfect match.\n\nBased on the skeleton's DNA, King and colleagues hypothesized that Richard had blue eyes and blond hair in childhood, which darkened with age. With no contemporary paintings of the king available, they compared their findings to the earliest known painting of him, which depicts the monarch with light brown hair and blue eyes, painted about 25 years after his death.\n\nThe research was published Tuesday in the journal, Nature Communications.\n\nScientists also compared the skeleton's DNA to samples from living relatives on Richard's father's side. They found no match, a discovery that could throw the nobility of some royals into question.\n\nWhile researchers weren't able to say where on the family tree the adultery occurred, they said the findings potentially raise questions about the legitimacy of Henry V, Henry VI and the entire Tudor dynasty, including Henry VIII and Elizabeth I.\n\nStill, Kevin Schurer, pro vice chancellor of the University of Leicester and another study author, said claims to the throne are based on more than simply having royal blood and also rest on other things such as battlefield victories and royal marriages.\n\nHe said England's current royal family \u2014 which has a line of descent from the House of Tudor \u2014 should not be worried. \"We are not in any way indicating that Her Majesty (Elizabeth II) shouldn't be on the throne,\" Schurer said.\n\nResearchers said it was the first time there was scientific evidence that questioned medieval lines of succession in the monarchy.\n\nOther academics said history is littered with claims and counter-claims of royal legitimacy.\n\n\"When Richard took the throne, he said his brother Edward should never have been king because he was illegitimate,\" said Steven Gunn, a tutor in history at Oxford University.\n\nGunn said it was unlikely anyone would ever learn the truth behind the most damaging rumors about Richard\u2014 that he murdered his young nephews to hang onto his crown. Still, Gunn said, a more complex picture of the king is now emerging.\n\n\"This opens up a new posthumous discussion about Richard's legacy,\" the historian said. \"He has been misrepresented as just a king with scoliosis.\"\n\n___\n\nOnline: www.nature.com\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press writer Jill Lawless in London contribute\n\nCopyright 2014 The Associated Press.
