A recent Rasmussen poll found 59% of likely voters consider reducing the cost of health care more important than making sure everyone has insurance, which is the goal of Obamacare.\n\nBut what can consumers to do control their costs? These days it\u2019s easy to comparison shop for just about anything \u2013 except medical care, one of the most expensive services you\u2019ll ever need.\n\nSharyl Attkisson with Full Measure partnered on a project to try to compare prices of specific procedures. They ended up with some incredible results, which showed it pays to shop around.\n\n\u201cI was often sent to the wrong place many times,\u201d began Scott Haller, research assistant at the Boston-based Pioneer Institute Research Group.\n\nHaller played the role of patient in the project. The Pioneer Institute Research Group helped conduct a survey for Full Measure of 54 hospitals in six states: Texas, New York, California, Iowa, North Carolina and Florida.\n\n\u201cI would call the operator,\u201d continued Haller, \u201cand ask for a cost estimate for an MRI of my left knee without contrast, and basically see where they sent me, because it could be one of many different places.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the help you\u2019ll need to prepare your household for the realities of living under a centralized health-care system \u2014 order Dr. Lee Hieb\u2019s \u201cSurviving the Medical Meltdown: Your Guide to Living Through the Disaster of Obamacare\u201d\n\nShopping around is more crucial than ever, with so many consumers paying thousands in cash out-of-pocket under Obamacare, according to the Pioneer Institute\u2019s Barbara Anthony.\n\n\u201cThe reason this is important,\u201d stated Anthony, \u201cis because we are now living in an age of high-deductible health plans. It used to be that your insurance coverage would take care of your health care expenses from the first dollar of your expenses. Well, that\u2019s no longer the case.\u201d\n\nGetting a cost estimate for an MRI \u2013 a radiology procedure that takes images of the inner body \u2013 should be simple. But Haller found it was like pulling teeth.\n\n\u201cThe operator would frequently send me straight to the MRI department,\u201d he noted, \u201cwho are on the front lines of giving the MRIs and often don\u2019t know anything about the bill. We\u2019d often get the run-around. People could be a little bit rude to you. All sorts of stuff, really.\u201d\n\nGetting even partial information on the price of an MRI took up to 11 persistent phone calls.\n\n\u201cOne time I was told to call an 800 number,\u201d said Haller, \u201cand got a coal company, who then immediately told me to dial 1-866 instead, and that got me where I wanted to go. They\u2019ve obviously been through that before. But there were many times when I would leave a message, sometimes multiple messages on the same person\u2019s phone, and they would just not get back to me after waiting over a week. Sometimes they\u2019d get back and say, \u2018I don\u2019t even know why you\u2019re calling me.'\u201d\n\n\u201cIn 25 percent of the hospitals we called, 14 of them,\u201d noted Anthony, \u201cwe were actually unable to get a final price.\u201d\n\nThe Pioneer Institute found hospitals around the country are ill-prepared to provide prices to consumers asking for basic information.\n\n\u201cThis is a big ship that we\u2019re turning as an industry,\u201d said Joe Fifer, CEO of the Healthcare Financial Management Association (HFMA), which represents many hospital finance executives. \u201cI don\u2019t defend the fact that it\u2019s very difficult for patients to navigate their way through this. That is something we need to fix. We know we need to fix it as an industry.\u201d\n\nFifer says what makes it so hard are the complex systems set up by the government and insurers using thousands of arcane codes with different fees, depending on who\u2019s paying the bill: private insurance, the government or the consumer.\n\n\u201cAlmost all of these codes have dollars associated with them that are on these charge-masters. They really become a part of a calculation to a different payment methodology.\u201d\n\nIf consumers get lost by this explanation, they\u2019re not alone.\n\nThe prices received in the survey were wildly inconsistent, and not tied to a city\u2019s size or cost of living. For example, one hospital in the Los Angeles area charged $400 for the knee MRI; but a hospital in smaller Des Moines, Iowa quoted over $3,500, eight and a half times as much for the exact same procedure.\n\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet \u2013 delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break!

In Orlando, one hospital charged as little as $877 total; another charged close to $2,000, and didn\u2019t even include the fee to read the MRI. Hospitals in Los Angeles charged from $400 to $2,800; Raleigh-Durham about $1,000 to $2,700; Des Moines from about $1,000 to $3,500; Dallas-Fort Worth from $500 to $4,200.\n\nThe biggest disparity was in the New York City area. The cheapest knee MRI was about $440; another hospital in the area, the most expensive in the survey, charged $4,500.\n\n\u201cI think we called something like 11 hospitals in the New York City region,\u201d said Anthony. \u201cThere was a difference in price of 1000 percent from the lowest price in New York to the highest price in New York. The point is, there are differences and they are huge. From the research we did, we couldn\u2019t figure out what would account for these huge differences in price.\u201d\n\nIn a similar study confined to Massachusetts last year, the Pioneer Institute also found price information difficult to obtain, even though Massachusetts require hospitals to give it under the strictest transparency law in the U.S. The ranges were equally as baffling. A dermatologist removing a wart cost anywhere from $85 to $400. A routine eye exam at an ophthalmologist went from $80 to $327. An adult MRI ranged from $700 at one hospital, to more than $8,000 at another.\n\nFifer said hospitals are not planning to come up with a single standard price list that they would all use; but they are working to meet consumer demand to give cost estimates up front.\n\n\u201cInternally, I would describe it as we\u2019re scrambling to be able to develop this capability,\u201d said Fifer. \u201cBut we\u2019re probably not moving fast enough for consumers that are \u2013 all of a sudden, seemingly overnight \u2013 sitting there with a multi-thousand dollar deductible health plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a country, we are really lagging behind in terms of health care price transparency for consumers,\u201d stated Anthony. \u201cIt is a very daunting task for the average consumer to find out the price of a procedure before obtaining that procedure. We really have a long way to go, all over the country, before we give consumers the tools they need in order to spend their health care dollars wisely.\u201d\n\nWho proved to be easiest to get quotes from? \u201cDentists and dermatologists,\u201d said Atkisson, \u201cpossibly because they\u2019ve always had a lot of patients who self-pay, since insurance often doesn\u2019t cover their procedures. Also, kudos to Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, which provided information on the cost of an MRI in just four minutes.\u201d\n\nThe entire report is available to view at Pioneer Institute\u2019s website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "As loud and divisive as the presidential campaign has been so far, both parties agree on one thing: health care is one of the top issues concerning Americans.
