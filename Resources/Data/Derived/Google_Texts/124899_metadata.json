After a restful weekend, the last thing anyone \u2014 and by that I mean me \u2014 wants to get into first thing on a Monday is a political argument, or to have to fend off unnecessary comments about things that are really beyond the scope of a blog like Wordplay.\n\nToday\u2019s puzzle by Timothy Polin wanders into unusual territory for a crossword puzzle that runs in a newspaper, especially when you consider that most papers started running these puzzles as a way for people to get away from the political discourse in the rest of the pages. Nevertheless, Mr. Polin\u2019s puzzle mentions four U.S. PRESIDENTS who represented two of the many United States political parties (cue \u201cBoth Sides Now\u201d) and so there is no need for anyone to feel left out or unduly picked on. You would think I wouldn\u2019t even need to mention that, but I am going ahead and putting it out there as part of the highly successful \u201cPreempt the Enraged Emails\u201d business strategy that I have adopted.\n\nAnyway, this was a smooth and easy solve, with some lovely entries that have absolutely nothing to do with politics, like KARMA (O.K., that one might be close), SCRUM, TROLLED, MWAH, POESY, IT\u2019S ON ME, NOT A SOUL, SOFT-BOILED and SWAGGERS. The PRESIDENTS come into it in the theme, which is a totally innocent list of eponymous things \u2014 OBAMACARE, REAGANOMICS, BUSHISM and HOOVERVILLE \u2014 that we all know about and have no need to belabor in the comments, because we all remember that this is not the place for it, right? If you want to talk political views, please feel free to go visit Nicholas Kristof. He loves that stuff.\n\nAs I was saying, this was a lovely way to start the week, and I thank Mr. Polin for a smooth yet heart-stopping puzzle that I am positive won\u2019t cause any trouble at all in the comments.\n\nLet\u2019s hear from him.\n\nConstructor\u2019s Notes:\n\nSometimes you just get lucky. There was a tiny pool of theme entries (only five that I could find) to draw from for this puzzle. Four of those were solid; the other was an outlier. That the four cohesive answers matched up as they did, with an appropriate revealer, was where good fortune came into play. What was the unsuitable answer? There\u2019s an overt reference to it somewhere in the grid. TEDDY (BEAR)! P.S. Had TEDDY BEAR been suitable, I would have paired it with OBAMACARE (more length luck) and skipped PRESIDENT altogether. This theme would probably work without a revealer.\n\nPlease rise for the totally patriotic playing of our national anthem.\n\nYour thoughts? The ones that have nothing to do with politics, I mean.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20151213180030, "BN": "wordplay", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "crosswords/wordplay", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/wordplay/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "December 13, 2015", "keywords": "Uncategorized,Crossword Puzzles", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/wordplay/Gets the Last Word ( 20151213 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Deb Amlen", "SCG": "wordplay", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Deb Amlen", "byl": "Deb Amlen", "twitter": {"description": "In which Timothy Polin tries to get me to talk about something I don\u2019t want to talk about.
