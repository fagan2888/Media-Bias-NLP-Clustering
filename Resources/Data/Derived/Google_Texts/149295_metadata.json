Apparently, the KKK and its history have faded from many white Americans\u2019 memory. Jeffrey Lord argued on national television this week that the Klan is an invention of \u201cthe left.\u201d As native sons of the South, we could forgive these men their ignorance. (\u201cBless their hearts. They ain\u2019t from around here,\u201d is the polite way to say it.) But we can neither forgive nor ignore the way 400 years of white supremacy have been naively reduced to whether a candidate will disavow the support of a hate group leader. Racism lives on in policies that perpetuate racial disparities, with or without the KKK.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Southern history, white supremacists in the South have a long history of disavowing the KKK. Strom Thurmond disavowed them in 1964, even as he filibustered the Civil Rights bill in the U.S. Senate. White Citizens Councils disavowed them while they fought desegregation in Mississippi. George Wallace publicly disavowed Klan violence in Alabama, but hired Klansman Al Lingo to oversee his state\u2019s Highway Patrol.\n\nNo one wants to be associated with the KKK in polite company today. But almost no one wanted to be publicly associated with them 50 years ago either.\n\nNor 60 years before that. Here in North Carolina, Democrats waged a takeover of state government in 1898, seeding a propaganda campaign to incite racial fears and arming the vigilante Red Shirts. But no sooner than they had regained power, Democratic leaders disavowed all violence and called for civility and a restoration of order.\n\nRacial disparities in America have not persisted since the end of the Civil War because people believe in the ideology or the tactics of the KKK. Inequality continues because we have never finished the work of Reconstruction.\n\n\u201cForty acres and a mule\u201d was the promise to formerly enslaved people during the First Reconstruction, recognizing that their success would require an economic base. But black representatives in Reconstruction legislatures were clear that more was needed; they demanded equal access to education, voting rights and equal protection under the law. The Klan\u2019s violence didn\u2019t end Reconstruction. While terror intimidated both black and white progressives, it took the denial of African-American voting rights and regressive legislative action to usher in the era of Jim Crow. While white Southerners have often been willing to resort to terror to maintain control, they disavow violence whenever power is securely in their hands.\n\nWe have learned that nothing challenges white supremacy more than the people joining hands across dividing lines to confront race-based policy. In the summer of 2013, more than 1,000 black, white and brown North Carolinians\u2013rich and poor, Republican, Independent and Democrat\u2014were arrested in the largest state government-focused civil disobedience campaign in U.S. history. Our movement noted that the same constitutional provision that prohibits KKK influence in state government also guarantees all citizens the right to instruct our legislators about matters affecting the general welfare. A Superior Court judge agreed, dismissing charges against us and affirming our right to publicly disavow race-based policies.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Racial disparities don't exist because Americans back the Klan.
