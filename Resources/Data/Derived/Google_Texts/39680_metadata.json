Last NFL season\u2019s Super Bowl champs, the Baltimore Ravens, have been hired to make the newest pitch for Obamacare. The team is getting $130,000 from American taxpayers to promote the health care law.\n\nThe deal was finalized back on September 9th of this year. What\u2019s funny about this is that the NFL confirmed months ago that it would not participate in the Obamacare public relations campaign. But apparently that wasn\u2019t enough. Maryland officials evidently appealed directly to their home team and now the Ravens will be helping market the state\u2019s Obamacare exchange.\n\nAccording to the \u201cSponsorship Agreement\u201d, the Maryland Health Connection will pay the Ravens to push Obamacare on TV, radio, on the team\u2019s website, its newsletter, and its social media.\n\nApparently players making millions of dollars every year is not enough. Now we have to use taxpayer money to pay them for their services...their services for the Obama administration.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We have seen various types of pushing Obamacare in the media, but this is taking it to a whole new level..05/24/2016 9:39:58AM EST.", "author": "Heather Ginsberg", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "We have seen various types of pushing Obamacare in the media, but this is taking it to a whole new level.", "title": "Heather Ginsberg - Our Tax Dollars Are Paying the NFL Ravens to Promote Obamacare", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/heatherginsberg/2013/10/23/our-tax-dollars-are-paying-the-nfl-ravens-to-promote-obamacare-n1730789", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/279/f352e1e6-8918-4ea1-bf7c-55ee53fe806b.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "We have seen various types of pushing Obamacare in the media, but this is taking it to a whole new level.", "title": "Heather Ginsberg - Our Tax Dollars Are Paying the NFL Ravens to Promote Obamacare", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/heatherginsberg/2013/10/23/our-tax-dollars-are-paying-the-nfl-ravens-to-promote-obamacare-n1730789", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/279/f352e1e6-8918-4ea1-bf7c-55ee53fe806b.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Our Tax Dollars Are Paying the NFL Ravens to Promote Obamacare, Heather Ginsberg, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaf30\"", "article_summary": "Last NFL season\u2019s Super Bowl champs, the Baltimore Ravens, have been hired to make the newest pitch for Obamacare.\nMaryland officials evidently appealed directly to their home team and now the Ravens will be helping market the state\u2019s Obamacare exchange.\nWhat\u2019s funny about this is that the NFL confirmed months ago that it would not participate in the Obamacare public relations campaign.\nAccording to the \u201cSponsorship Agreement\u201d, the Maryland Health Connection will pay the Ravens to push Obamacare on TV, radio, on the team\u2019s website, its newsletter, and its social media.\nWe have seen various types of pushing Obamacare in the media, but this is taking it to a whole new level."}
