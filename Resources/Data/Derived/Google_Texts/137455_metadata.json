One thing has nothing to do with the other,\u201d Dyer said.\n\nWhile that may be so, some in the legislature said it\u2019s hard to justify paying for stadiums while leaving healthcare unfunded.\n\nLawmakers are at a stalemate over whether or not to expand Medicaid funding, a provision the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe bill needs to pass by May 1.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Plans for a new Orlando City Soccer stadium could be stalling, because $30 million for the project has not been approved by lawmakers.", "author": "EndPlay", "og": {"site_name": "WFTV", "description": "Plans for a new Orlando City Soccer stadium could be stalling, because $30 million for the project has not been approved by lawmakers.", "title": "Some Orlando City Soccer stadium funding in limbo", "url": "http://www.wftv.com/news/local/plans-orlando-city-stadium-could-be-stalling/69615062", "image": {"width": 160, "altText": "Orlando City Stadium Renderings_5364921", "title": "Orlando City Stadium Renderings_5364921", "identifier": "http://mediaweb.wftv.com/photo/2014/06/10/C09_Base_rev05_1413058_ver1.0_160_90.jpg", "height": 90}, "locale": "en_US", "video": {"height": 0, "width": 0, "thumbnailUrl": "http://mediaweb.wftv.com/photo/2016/02/04/Some%20Orlando%20City%20Soccer%20stadium%20funding%20in%20limbo_11047731_1454578672651_1248306_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "content-type": "video", "title": "Some Orlando City Soccer stadium funding in limbo"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Plans for a new Orlando City Soccer stadium could be stalling, because $30 million for the project has not been approved by lawmakers.", "title": "Some Orlando City Soccer stadium funding in limbo", "url": "http://www.wftv.com/news/local/plans-orlando-city-stadium-could-be-stalling/69615062", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://mediaweb.wftv.com/photo/2014/06/10/C09_Base_rev05_1413058_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "height": 720}, "site": "@WFTV", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "wftvheadlines,sports,orange county, StoryKeywords", "article": {"section": "Local", "tag": "sports, orange county, wftvheadlines", "published_time": "2015-04-23T20:26:39+0000", "modified_time": "2015-04-23T20:26:39+0000"}, "news_keywords": "Some Orlando City Soccer stadium funding in limbo", "content_id": 69615062, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page-type": "article"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5656\"", "article_summary": "Photos: Thousands march downtown for Orlando City Soccer MLS stadium groundbreakingPhotos: Orlando City stadium renderingsThe state funds were up for grabs between Orlando City Soccer, the Daytona International Speedway and two other Florida sports teams.\nMany Orlando City Soccer fans received an email from the team, asking them to contact local representatives and voice their support for the Major League Soccer stadium funding bill.\nUpdated: Apr 23, 2015 - 4:26 PMPlans for a new Orlando City Soccer stadium could be stalling, because $30 million for the project has not been approved by lawmakers.\nLawmakers are at a stalemate over whether or not to expand Medicaid funding, a provision the Affordable Care Act.\nMayor Buddy Dyer said that money is integral to the new stadium, and with the funds still in limbo in Tallahassee, it's unclear what will happen if it doesn't get approved."}
