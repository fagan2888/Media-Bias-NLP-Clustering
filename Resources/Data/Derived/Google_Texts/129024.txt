EyeMed Vision Care is the second vision carrier chosen to showcase its offerings on CoveredCA.com

SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Covered California now has a second pathway to vision plans under an agreement with EyeMed Vision Care.

“We’re excited EyeMed is on board to offer another vision care path for consumers to choose from,” Covered California Executive Director Peter V. Lee said. “EyeMed Vision Care is a proven leader in the vision service community, and we believe it will bring added value to consumers shopping at CoveredCA.com.”

Beginning today, visitors to CoveredCA.com can access EyeMed Vision Care via a link, which will take the consumer to EyeMed Vision Care’s website. Once there, consumers will work directly with EyeMed Vision Care to shop for vision benefits and see what coverage options are best for their situation.

“EyeMed is pleased to join CoveredCA.com and provide a pathway for Californians shopping for vision coverage,” EyeMed Vision Care President Lukas Ruecker said. “Whether it’s our wide choice of providers, exam technology or eyewear solutions, we look forward to providing consumers access to digital, 21st-century tools they need to navigate their choices with confidence.”

As part of the agreement with Covered California, EyeMed Vision Care will conduct annual consumer surveys to ensure a positive consumer experience. In addition, EyeMed Vision Care will provide quarterly enrollment reports to Covered California based on those who have accessed EyeMed Vision Care through CoveredCA.com.

Covered California is committed to providing access to a wide range of options for consumers and serving as a one-stop shopping location for all their health care needs. In addition to the health plans offered through the exchange, Covered California also has dental options available. The addition of EyeMed Vision Care to the Covered California platform creates one more option for consumers.

Adult vision care is not an essential health benefit under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and coverage is handled directly through EyeMed Vision Care. Vision services for children are an essential health benefit and are included in all health plans purchased through Covered California. Enrollment with EyeMed Vision Care into vision plans is available year-round, and there are no open enrollment dates.

About Covered California

Covered California is the state’s marketplace for the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Covered California, in partnership with the California Department of Health Care Services, was charged with creating a new health insurance marketplace in which individuals and small businesses can get access to affordable health insurance plans. Covered California helps individuals determine whether they are eligible for premium assistance that is available on a sliding-scale basis to reduce insurance costs or whether they are eligible for low-cost or no-cost Medi-Cal. Consumers can then compare health insurance plans and choose the plan that works best for their health needs and budget. Small businesses can purchase competitively priced health insurance plans and offer their employees the ability to choose from an array of plans and may qualify for federal tax credits.

Covered California is an independent part of the state government whose job is to make the new market work for California’s consumers. It is overseen by a five-member board appointed by the Governor and the Legislature. For more information about Covered California, please visit www.CoveredCA.com.
