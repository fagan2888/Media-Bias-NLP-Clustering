One person was shot in the head Friday night at the Washington Gardens Apartment complex in Elkhart.

According to Elkhart Police, officers were called to the 300 block of Wagner Avenue about 7:30 p.m. Friday.

When they arrived, they found the victim and provided first aid until paramedics arrived. The victim was taken to Elkhart General Hospital and later transferred to South Bend's Memorial Hospital.

Officers and evidence technicians were on scene until the early morning hours today collecting evidence.

The apartment complex was also the scene of a fatal shooting in September. The Elkhart County prosecutor's office is continuing to review that case in which police officers shot and killed a 32-year-old man wanted for shooting a teen. Officers said they fired at the suspect after he pointed a gun at them while he was trying to flee.

Anybody with information regarding Friday's shooting is asked to contact the Elkhart Police Department at 574-295-7070 or the Tip Line at 574-389-4777.
