Right now, if you take a capital gain a day more than one year, you are taxed at a 20 percent rate. Actually, it's 23.8 percent when you include the health-care surtax. So under Clinton's brilliant new play, you'd be taxed at 43.4 percent \u2014 the top individual cap-gains rate of 39.6 percent plus the 3.8 percent Obamacare surtax.\n\nRead MoreClinton lashes out at activists in Apple, others\n\nThat means, instead of keeping 80 cents on the additional dollar of profit, you'd only keep 56.6 cents \u2014 a 30-percentage-point reduction in the take-home-pay reward for taking an extra dollar's investment risk.\n\n\n\nThis will create a tall barrier to investment \u2014 what we don't need. If you tax something more, you get less of it.\n\n\n\nClinton complains about too much \"short-termism\" in the economy. But her program might well create more of it. That's because she has a sliding tax-rate scale, whereby assets held two to three years would be taxed at 39.8 percent and assets held three to four years at 35.8 percent. And you don't get back to the statutory 20 percent cap-gains rate unless you hold an asset for six-plus years.\n\nWho's going to lock themselves into that? What if new investment opportunities arise? Want to convert your current holding into cash so you can invest in your brother-in-law's start-up? Maybe it's the next Facebook. Who knows? The point is, the Clinton plan exacts a huge tax penalty on the movement from old capital to new.\n\n\n\nRead MoreClinton rakes in Wall Street cash amid tough talk\n\nThe late Jude Wanniski called this re-oxygenating the economy. Ms. Clinton would snuff that out. Her short-termism fear will lock us into long-term economic stagnation.\n\n\n\nBy the way, the numbers are actually worse, because capital gains are already taxed as corporate profits. What investors pay is a double tax.\n\n\n\nSo let's go back to Hillary's top cap-gains rate of 43.8 percent. The government takes 35 percent of your profit in corporate taxes, leaving 65 cents to be taxed a second time as capital gains at the new 43.8 percent rate. That results in a take-home profit of 37 cents on the dollar.\n\n\n\nIs that enough to reward the risk of investing in the next Uber? Except for Mayor Bill de Blasio, who hates Uber, most people would say no.\n\n\n\nBut that's Hillary's plan.\n\n\n\nHow powerful is the capital-gains tax? The non-partisan Tax Foundation rates it among the top three economic-growth influences on the economy, along with full cash-expensing for new investment in plants and equipment and the corporate tax. And compared with the rest of the world, the U.S. has fallen far behind in terms of this investment-tax-penalty grouping.\n\n\n\nThis is government tinkering at its worst. The reality is that Hillary Clinton is attempting to punish success and redistribute income.\n\n\n\nRead MoreOp-ed: Four reasons I'm voting for Hillary\n\nDid someone say tax the rich? Clinton proposes an income threshold of $484,850 for married couples filing jointly. Oh my gosh! Successful economic activists! Let's get 'em!\n\n\n\nIronically, history shows that periods of higher capital-gains tax rates produce less revenue as a share of all federal revenue and as a fraction of GDP. Hillary's not even redistributing efficiently.\n\n\n\nAnd then there's what some call the \"Charles Gibson effect.\" Gibson interviewed then-Senator Obama in 2008 for ABC News. Obama said he'd raise the cap-gains tax from 15 percent to 28 percent. But Gibson reminded Obama that when Bill Clinton and George Bush lowered cap-gains tax rates, revenues actually increased. In other words, the Laffer curve. But Obama said it didn't matter because he wanted to be \"fair.\"\n\n\n\nIt also doesn't matter to Hillary. She wants to beat Bernie Sanders, or at least cuddle up to the Vermont socialist. What nonsense. Bad economics and bad politics. Voters will understand this.\n\n\n\nRead MoreOp-ed: What will it take for Bernie Sanders to beat Hilary?\n\nGoofy ideas like this make me yearn for a 15-percent flat-tax rate on everything. Personal income, corporate profits, capital gains, dividends \u2014 everything. But that still leaves me with a double-tax problem for investment and savings. So it's probably time to blow up the corporate-tax code altogether. That would get us to the 4-percent-plus growth path advocated by some of the Republicans on the campaign trail.\n\n\n\nAnd that would get us some \"long-termism\" economic growth \u2014 just what the country yearns for.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "blogpost", "description": "Hillary Clinton's proposed capital-gains tax makes no sense for the economy, says Larry Kudlow.", "author": "Larry Kudlow", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Hillary Clinton's proposed capital-gains tax makes no sense for the economy, says Larry Kudlow.", "title": "Kudlow: Hillary's inconceivably stupid tax", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/25/hillarys-inconceivably-stupid-capital-gains-tax-scheme-kudlow-commentary.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/07/24/102862053-480664444.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hillary Clinton's proposed capital-gains tax makes no sense for the economy, says Larry Kudlow.", "title": "Hillary\u2019s inconceivably stupid capital-gains tax scheme", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/25/hillarys-inconceivably-stupid-capital-gains-tax-scheme-kudlow-commentary.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/07/24/102862053-480664444.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@Larry_Kudlow", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Kudlow's Corner, Commentary, Health Care, Taxes, Politics, US: News, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Facebook, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-07-25T08:59:42-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Kudlow's Corner", "modified_time": "2015-07-25T09:09:01-0400", "tag": "Facebook"}, "pageNodeId": 102864205, "news_keywords": "Hillary Clinton, capital-gains tax, 2016 election, Larry Kudlow,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2f66\"", "article_summary": "And you don't get back to the statutory 20 percent cap-gains rate unless you hold an asset for six-plus years.\nSo let's go back to Hillary's top cap-gains rate of 43.8 percent.\nBut Gibson reminded Obama that when Bill Clinton and George Bush lowered cap-gains tax rates, revenues actually increased.\nObama said he'd raise the cap-gains tax from 15 percent to 28 percent.\nThe point is, the Clinton plan exacts a huge tax penalty on the movement from old capital to new."}
