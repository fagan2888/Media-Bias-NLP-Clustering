The depth and strength of voters\u2019 conviction that their opponents are determined to destroy their way of life has rarely been matched, perhaps only by the mood of the South in the years leading up to the Civil War.\n\nIn a recent column for Bloomberg View, my friend Frank Wilkinson put together a concise explanation:\n\nA lot of Americans were not ready for a mixed-race president. They weren\u2019t ready for gay marriage. They weren\u2019t ready for the wave of legal and illegal immigration that redefined American demographics over the past two or three decades, bringing in lots of nonwhites. They weren\u2019t ready \u2014 who was? \u2014 for the brutal effects of globalization on working- and middle-class Americans or the devastating fallout from the financial crisis. Their representatives didn\u2019t stop Obamacare. And their side didn\u2019t \u201ctake back America\u201d in 2012 as Fox News and conservative radio personalities led them to believe they would. They feel the culture is running away from them (and they\u2019re mostly right). They lack the power to control their own government. But they still have just enough to shut it down.\n\n\n\nAnimosity toward the federal government has been intensifying at a stunning rate. In a survey released on Sept. 23, Gallup found that the percentage of Republicans saying the federal government has too much power \u2014 81 percent \u2014 had reached a record-setting level.\n\nThe movement to the right on the part of the Republican electorate can be seen in Gallup surveys calculating that the percentage of Republicans who identify themselves as conservative grew between 2002 and 2010 by 10 percentage points, from 62 to 72 percent. During the same period, the percentage of Republicans who identify themselves as moderates fell from 31 to 23 percent.\n\nThese trends date back to the 1970s. Surveys conducted by American National Election Studies found that the percentage of self-described conservative Republicans rose from 42 in 1972 to 65 percent in 2008, while the percentage of moderate Republicans fell from 26 to 16 percent. Liberal Republicans \u2014 remember them? \u2014 fell from 10 to 4 percent.\n\nTake the findings of a Pew Research Center survey released four weeks ago. They show that discontent with Republican House and Senate leaders runs deep among Republican primary voters: two-thirds of them disapprove of their party\u2019s Congressional leadership \u2014 John Boehner, the speaker of the House, and Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader.\n\nSometimes you have to turn to the know-your-enemy people to understand what\u2019s going on. The Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner is one of the keenest observers of the contemporary Republican electorate. He is conducting an ongoing study called the \u201cThe Republican Party Project\u201d for the liberal nonprofit organization Democracy Corps. Greenberg\u2019s premise is that \u201cyou cannot understand the government shutdown unless you understand the G.O.P. from the inside.\u201d\n\nGreenberg puts Republicans into three categories (Figure 1): evangelical and religiously observant voters (47 percent); libertarian-leaning Tea Party supporters (22 percent); and moderates (25 percent).\n\nPhoto\n\nLast week Greenberg released the results of six focus groups conducted with evangelical and other religiously observant Republicans (in Roanoke, Va., and Colorado Springs, Colo.), Tea Party supporters who are not evangelicals (Raleigh, N.C., and Roanoke), and moderate Republicans (Raleigh and Colorado Springs).\n\nOne of the key factors pushing Republicans to extremes, according to Greenberg\u2019s report, is the intensity of animosity toward Obama. This animosity among participants in all six focus groups is reflected in Figure 2, which represents a \u201cword cloud\u201d of focus group references to the president, with the size of each word in the cloud proportional to the frequency with which it was used.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the six focus groups of Republican voters, according to Greenberg\u2019s report, \u201cfew explicitly talk about Obama in racial terms,\u201d but\n\nthe base supporters are very conscious of being white in a country with growing minorities. Their party is losing to a Democratic Party of big government whose goal is to expand programs that mainly benefit minorities. Race remains very much alive in the politics of the Republican Party.\n\nVoters like this, according to the report, are convinced that they have lost the larger battle:\n\nWhile many voters, including plenty of Democrats, question whether Obama is succeeding and getting his agenda done, Republicans think he has won. The country as a whole may think gridlock has triumphed, particularly in the midst of a Republican-led government shutdown, but Republicans see a president who has fooled and manipulated the public, lied, and gotten his secret socialist-Marxist agenda done. Republicans and their kind of Americans are losing.\n\nIn his report for the Democracy Corps, Greenberg describes the Republican base electorate as fearful of being strategically outmaneuvered:\n\nThey think they face a victorious Democratic Party that is intent on expanding government to increase dependency and therefore electoral support. It starts with food stamps and unemployment benefits; expands further if you legalize the illegals; but insuring the uninsured dramatically grows those dependent on government. They believe this is an electoral strategy \u2014 not just a political ideology or economic philosophy. If Obamacare happens, the Republican Party may be lost, in their view.\n\nConservative troops blame moderate Republican for what they see as Democratic victories. The Republican base\n\nthinks they are losing politically and losing control of the country \u2013 and their starting reaction is \u201cworried,\u201d \u201cdiscouraged,\u201d \u201cscared,\u201d and \u201cconcerned\u201d about the direction of the country \u2013 and a little powerless to change course. They think Obama has imposed his agenda, while Republicans in D.C. let him get away with it.\n\nFigure 3 represents a second word cloud generated by Greenberg\u2019s data showing which words came up most often in all six focus groups:\n\nPhoto\n\nGreenberg\u2019s study found that in the view of many, if not most, Republicans\n\nthe Democratic Party exists to create programs and dependency \u2013 the food stamp hammock, entitlements, the 47 percent. And on the horizon \u2014 comprehensive immigration reform and Obamacare. Citizenship for 12 million illegals and tens of million getting free health care is the end of the road.\n\n\u201cThese voters think they are losing the country,\u201d Greenberg said during an Oct. 3 conference call with reporters.\n\nAmong Greenberg\u2019s other findings from his focus groups:\n\nThe participants \u201care very conscious of being white in a country that is increasingly minority.\u201d\n\nRepublican voters are threatened by Obama and the Democratic Party, but they are angry at their own party leaders. \u201cThe problem in D.C. is not gridlock; Obama has won; the problem is Republicans failing to stop him.\u201d\n\nTogether, evangelicals and Tea Party supporters comprise more than half the party. Moderates, about a quarter of Republicans, \u201care very conscious of being illegitimate within their own party.\u201d\n\n\u2022\n\nThe evangelical and Tea Party wings of the Republican Party combine into a clear majority of Republican voters, and according to Greenberg, they have a mutually reinforcing relationship:\n\nSocial issues are central for Evangelicals and they feel a deep sense of cultural and political loss. They believe their towns, communities, and schools are suffering from a deep \u201cculture rot\u201d that has invaded from the outside. The central focus here is homosexuality, but also the decline of homogenous small towns. They like the Tea Party because they stand up to the Democrats.\n\nTea Party supporters, according to Greenberg\u2019s research, have a more libertarian edge, but their worldview is compatible with the evangelical agenda:\n\nBig government, Obama, the loss of liberty, and decline of responsibility are central to the Tea Party worldview. Obama\u2019s America is an unmitigated evil based on big government, regulations, and dependency. They are not focused on social issues at all. They like the Tea Party because it is getting \u201cback to basics\u201d and believe it has the potential to reshape the G.O.P.\n\nJohn Boehner is just the kind of Republican leader the hard right dislikes \u2013 a deal maker, a compromiser. The Republican primary electorate, with its hold on a solid block of Republican representatives and its ability to recruit and promote challengers, now has Boehner trapped. Personally inclined to find his way out of the face-to-face confrontation \u2013 he is, after all, a career politician loath to shut down the government \u2014 Boehner has been forced into a confrontation, with less and less room for negotiation with his own party\u2019s warring flanks and with Democrats.\n\nTwo days after Obama\u2019s re-election, when Republicans lost eight seats but retained their House majority (232 to 200, with three vacancies), Boehner was asked by Diane Sawyer on ABC, \u201cYou have said next year that you would repeal the health care vote. That\u2019s still your mission?\u201d Boehner replied: \u201cWell, I think the election changes that. It\u2019s pretty clear that the president was re-elected, Obamacare is the law of the land.\u201d\n\nThat same day, Michael O\u2019Brien of NBC News suggested that\n\nThe speaker\u2019s pronouncement, if nothing else, signifies a pivot away from Republicans\u2019 efforts to showcase for conservatives their doggedness in looking to repeal Obamacare.\n\nNearly a year later, on Oct. 6, Boehner admitted that he had been forced to capitulate by constituent pressures on Republican members of the House. Appearing again on ABC, this time with George Stephanopoulos, Boehner said, \u201cI and my members decided the threat of Obamacare and what was happening was so important that it was time for us to take a stand.\u201d\n\nStephanopoulos asked, \u201cDid you decide it or was it decided for you?\u201d Boehner\u2019s answer:\n\nI, working with my members, decided to do this in a unified way. George, I have 233 Republicans in the House. And you\u2019ve never seen a more dedicated group of people who are thoroughly concerned about the future of our country. They believe that Obamacare, all these regulations coming out of the administration, are threatening the future for our kids and our grandkids. It is time for us to stand and fight.\n\nA determined minority can do a lot in our system. It has already won the battle for the hearts and minds of the Republican House caucus. That is not a modest victory.\n\nAs of October 2013, Tom Edsall\u2019s column can be found in a new location in the Opinion section \u00bb\n\n", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131008232031, "BN": "opinionator", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/opinionator", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/opinionator/post", "per": "Boehner, John A", "article": {"published_time": 1381288831, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/contributors/thomasbedsall/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Thomas B.
