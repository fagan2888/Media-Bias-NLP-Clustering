An Okmulgee man who walked away from a state corrections center south of El Reno in February is back behind bars.

The Oklahoma Department of Corrections says a tip led to the arrest of James Morgan, 44 on Wednesday at a home in Midwest City. The DOC listed Morgan as one of their top fugitives, because of what they said was his history of violence.

Morgan was last seen February 14. He was serving time at the Union City Correctional Center for an Okmulgee County drug conviction.

The DOC says Morgan was set to be released in 2019.
