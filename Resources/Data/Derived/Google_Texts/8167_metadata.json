He survived with serious injuries.\n\nBoth men had attended the concert at Red Rocks of Yonder Mountain String Band.\n\nThe names of the victims have not been released.\n\nThe injured man apparently was knocked unconscious when he fell. He may have suffered a concussion. He had damage to his ribs, Scholting said.\n\nThe sunshine woke him up Saturday morning, he later told rescuers.\n\nHe crawled down a trail to the parking lot and collapsed next to his pickup truck, Scholting said.\n\nTwo passers-by found the man Saturday and called 911 at 9:37 a.m., she said. When rescuers arrived, the injured man had trouble describing where his buddy had fallen, she said.\n\n\u201cHe was pretty banged up,\u201d Assistant Chief Tony Wilkins said. \u201cWe rushed him emergent to a hospital.\u201d\n\nIt took rescuers another half hour to find the other man\u2019s body.\n\n\u201cThe other climber unfortunately did not make it,\u201d Wilkins said. \u201cOur hearts go out to the families.\u201d\n\nScholting said the two men may have climbed over the rocks from the amphitheatre and then fell, or they may have followed a trail before going off limits, she said.\n\n\u201cThey fell from a closed area,\u201d Scholting said.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how far the dead man fell. He landed on a rock shelf in a crevice. There are a few ledges he may have fallen from. The highest is about 100 feet above the crevice.\n\nOn Saturday, firefighters cleared brush away so they could get a gurney to the area where the man fell, Scholting said.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, denverpost.com/coldcases or twitter.com/kirkmitchell", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Man who attended concert at Red Rocks later tumbles to his death", "title": "Man who attended concert at Red Rocks later tumbles to his death", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/22/man-who-attended-concert-at-red-rocks-later-tumbles-to-his-death/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-22T11:30:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-22T11:30:10+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "On Saturday, firefighters cleared brush away so they could get a gurney to the area where the man fell, Scholting said.\nBoth men had attended the concert at Red Rocks of Yonder Mountain String Band.\nA man who attended Friday night\u2019s bluegrass concert at Red Rocks Amphitheatre was climbing rocks after the show and fell as far as 100 feet to his death, authorities say.\nWhen rescuers arrived, the injured man had trouble describing where his buddy had fallen, she said.\nIt\u2019s unclear how far the dead man fell."}
