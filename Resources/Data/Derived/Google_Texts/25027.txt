Twelve years ago I supervised the launch of four U.S. Air Force tankers into the late afternoon sky from a base 30 miles north of Cambridge, England. Then night came, and somewhere in that darkness, thousands of miles away, our tankers refueled the bombers that would push into Iraqi airspace and drop their bellies full of explosives across Mesopotamia.

Standing on the air base’s perimeter grass that night I held a four-pound wrench and watched, alongside my aircraft maintenance crew, for any protesters who might attempt to scale the barbed-wire fence. News of the war was out—there’d been rumors for days about fence hoppers—so when the command center radioed something about suspicious activity along the perimeter, we ran. We heeded the warnings: be prepared for everything from spray paint to explosives. Activist estimates in the hundreds. Military police could use a hand. Grab what you can.

That night in England, I wasn’t thinking about fuel or Baghdad or the crashed towers or Bush. I didn’t mark the when: March 2003, or consider the millions of seconds and choices that had led me to the Air Force and that foreign base.

I was only thinking about where to land the first blow. I imagined the body of the first hopper, the wrench doing its work. But where? Knees? Abdomen? Safe. Nonlethal. Anything above the shoulders could be trouble. Would I wait for them to hit the ground or catch them in midair?

I gripped the wrench’s rubber handle and felt its perfect balance, the glorious potential of my swing.

The wind picked up and I listened. Air brakes in the distance. Our collective breathing. I stretched my legs, cursed the pacifists, and tried to shake the swirling anxiety. If anything happened I hoped it would only be spray paint vandals.
