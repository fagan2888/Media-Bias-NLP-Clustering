Corrine Brown, D-FL 5th District, brought a campaign to put Florida Medicaid expansion on the ballot to Central Florida on Friday.\n\nBrown is backing Florida Health Solutions, a political action committee that\u2019s seeking more than 680,000 signatures by Feb. 1 to get on the 2016 ballot.\n\n\u201cYou can put it on the ballot, but the person gotta be registered and gotta vote,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThey have to understand they have a dog in the fight. And what we\u2019re gonna do is encourage people to soldier up, do their part.\u201d\n\nBrown, who was flanked by local clergy, said they planned to bring the message to churches over the weekend. The proposed constitutional amendment expands Medicaid eligibility to 133 percent of the poverty line, or about $33,000 for a family of four.\n\nBrown said the campaign is statewide.\n\n\u201cWe started out in Jacksonville, we went to Miami, we\u2019re here in Orlando, we going to Gainesville,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThis is going to be a state initiative to put it on the ballot so the people can decide.\u201d\n\nThe campaign has significant hurdles. The group has fewer than 90 days to collect signatures, for one. And the group has no money, according to its most recent filings.\n\nFlorida is one of 19 states that didn\u2019t expand Medicaid, with many Republican lawmakers worried it will cost too much money. Florida has 567,000 people who would be get health insurance if Florida expanded Medicaid, according to estimates from the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nReporter Abe Aboraya is part of WMFE in Orlando.
