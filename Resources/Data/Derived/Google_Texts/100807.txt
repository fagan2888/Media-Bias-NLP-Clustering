An AstraZeneca spokeswoman said, "Eggs used to manufacture FluMist/Fluenz are not affected by the egg shortage." She added that the eggs used to produce those vaccines come from "specific pathogen-free chickens which are housed in entirely separate sites and facilities from chickens used for the food supply," which are the ones that have been affected by the avian flu virus.



"SPF chickens are kept under specific, very tightly controlled conditions that use filtered-air positive pressure housing, critical biosecurity measures and the careful selection of layer flocks," the spokeswoman said.

CSL Behring's spokeswoman said: "The production of our influenza vaccine will not be affected by the current egg shortage, either this upcoming season or future ones. Our 2015-2016 vaccine has already been produced, and we have our own isolated egg production system, keeping us secure for the future."

A spokeswoman for Sanofi Pasteur said the avian flu outbreak likewise "has not impacted the supply of Fluzone vaccines," and noted that the first of what the company has said will be more than 65 million doses began being shipped in mid-July.

"We continue to maintain preventative measures for our egg supply," she said.
