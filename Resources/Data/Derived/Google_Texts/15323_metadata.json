Chuck Schumer threw Obamacare under the bus Tuesday, charging that Democrats should not have passed the law in 2010.\n\nSchumer, the third-ranking Senate Democrat, spoke Tuesday at the National Press Club in Washington about the Democrats\u2019 losses in this year\u2019s elections. He encouraged Democrats to embrace government despite their electoral crash but also admitted that the Democratic House and Senate should not have passed Obamacare.\n\nDemocrats should have focused on directly helping the middle class, Schumer argued.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Democrats blew the opportunity the American people gave them\u201d by electing President Obama and a Democratic-controlled Congress in 2008. \u201cWe took their mandate and put all our focus on the wrong problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe plight of uninsured Americans and the hardships created by unfair insurance company practices certainly needed to be addressed,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t the change we were hired to make\u201d in the 2008 election. \u201cAmericans were crying out for the end to the recession, for better wages and more jobs \u2014 not changes in health care.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act was aimed at the 36 million Americans who were not covered,\u201d Schumer continued. \u201cIt\u2019s been reported that only a third of the uninsured are even registered to vote,\u201d making Obamacare unlikely to win the Democrats any votes at all.\n\n\u201cEven if the uninsured kept with the rate, which they likely didn\u2019t, you would still only be talking about five percent of the electorate,\u201d Schumer said. It made \u201cno political sense\u201d and left the middle class thinking the \u201cDemocrats are not paying enough attention to me.\u201d\n\nSchumer repeatedly slammed tea party forces and business, while promoting a \u201cstrong government.\u201d He claimed that many Americans aren\u2019t actually anti-government, but only want government to be \u201con their side.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven though health care had very real benefits, it did for a small slice of the country,\u201d Schumer admitted. \u201cThere were even some policies that would help constituencies in the middle class, but not a great deal of people. Those policies should be considered, but shouldn\u2019t be the core of the Democratic platform.\u201d\n\nSchumer also said the new Republican Senate majority\u2019s goal of repealing the medical device tax a focus on the \u201cshort term needs of a few, narrow special interests.\u201d\n\nRepeal \u201cmight create a few jobs in a certain and small industry. But funding [the National Institutes of Health] would create hundreds of thousands of jobs, not only with medical devices, but pharmaceuticals, biotech and a host of other spin-off industries,\u201d Schumer argued, although he noted even he supports its repeal.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "'Democrats blew the opportunity the American people gave them'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Democratic Sen.
