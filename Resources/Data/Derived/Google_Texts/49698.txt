Vermillion, SD

Saturday night the Lincoln Patriots etched their name in history by capturing the first 11AAA state title with a 47-24 win over Roosevelt. It was also the first perfect season in school history.

The Patriots entered the title game without their starting quarterback Connor Burchill. Coach Aaron Beavers had nothing but confidence putting the reigns in the hands of junior Isiah Roach.

"I expected him to captain the ship pretty well. Connor Burchill did a great job this week mentoring him. Isiah is a good athlete and he would be playing quarterback for a lot of teams in the state. I'm just glad I have him and then again for another year," Lincoln Head Coach Aaron Beaver said.

Next year the Pats will be without the state's top back Caden Quintanillia. He won his second state title, but his first at Lincoln.

"It's amazing, it's really indescribable. My heart goes out to the Roosevelt players, I love those guys. I won a championship with those guys when I was younger. I played with a lot of those guys. I'm glad I'm with my team now, they deserve it," Patriots Running Back Caden Quintanillia said.

No. 25 broke the rushing record with 244 yards while tying the touchdown record with four earning him Joe Robbie Player of the Game honors. Not only did he do it against his former squad, but along side coach Beavers who is more than a coach to him.

"He's my uncle and I love him to death. He has helped me with football since I was a little boy. I'm glad I was able to win a championship for him," Quintanillia said.

Coach Beavers will be back with his whistle and playbook next year. He knows for many of his 23 seniors this may be it.

"There is going to be some guys that are going to put on a football uniform again, but a lot of them will not. This is their last memory of that and I'm glad I could be a part of it," Beavers said.

With the win the Patriots earned five more KELO Cup points putting Lincoln in second.
