(Heather Charles, Chicago Tribune)\n\nBut don't take our word. Your own National Park Service Midwest Region completed a report this summer that brags about the Pullman district for a daunting 52 pages. \"The Pullman Historic District seems to represent a unique combination of themes in a time period of American industrialization and labor not represented in the National Park System or adequately preserved and interpreted elsewhere,\" the report concludes.\n\nSo we'll cut to the (train) chase: Use your executive authority under the Antiquities Act of 1906 to declare Pullman part of the National Park System.\n\nYou have used the act during your presidency to declare eight national monuments around the country. A national park is a big deal \u2014 we won't use the exact phrase Vice President Joe Biden whispered into a hot microphone when you signed Obamacare \u2014 but you get the idea. Declaring a national park requires a more rigorous process than does designating a monument.\n\nLet us assure you: That process has been wrung through. For decades, historians, local governments and dedicated Pullman rail car and neighborhood enthusiasts have lobbied to elevate Pullman from its 1970 status as a National Historic Landmark. Do you know how many reports and studies have been completed on Pullman? Dozens.\n\nThe latest report from the National Park Service gushes about its unique characteristics. If awarded park status, Pullman would become Illinois' second national park; the other is the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield.\n\nCompleting the Park Service report was one of the steps required before park status could be attained. In its conclusion, the authors call for a follow-up study to weigh the long-term feasibility of Pullman, and then an act by Congress.\n\nMr. President, enough bureaucracy. Another costly study \u2014 some estimates fall in the $400,000 range \u2014 would take at least two years, and it isn't necessary. The lingering questions about how a Pullman national park would be managed and marketed can be decided without more paperwork and wasted time.\n\nPullman needs swift, decisive action via executive order to jump-start economic development. Damaged by the death of manufacturing, Chicago's Southeast Side and Pullman need exactly this type of federal nudge. The local residents can't do it. The city can't do it. The state can't do it. You can do it.\n\nThe dainty row houses of Pullman remain a testament to the one-of-a-kind development George Pullman brought to Chicago. From the wisps of a prairie, he built and then owned one of the country's first factory towns. The workers who built his upscale passenger rail cars lived in housing on the property. Most of that housing remains in its original dollhouse state.\n\nDesignating Pullman a national park would make the Pullman campus a tourist and train enthusiasts' destination and spur entrepreneurs to open businesses in the surrounding area.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "opinion, editorials, news", "og": {"site_name": "tribunedigital-chicagotribune", "description": "Dear President Obama, You've been busy.
