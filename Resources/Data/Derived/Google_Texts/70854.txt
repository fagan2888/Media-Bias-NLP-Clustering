NFL reporter Mike Klis suggests five goals for the Broncos in their preseason game Saturday night against the Houston Texans:

1. Please Peyton: Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning said the offense got its butts kicked by the Texans’ defense Tuesday. The starters will have to make a better showing in the first half against J.J. Watt and company.

2. Get Emmanuel two catches: Demaryius Thomas already has 10 preseason catches. That’s enough. Manning needs to get his game-timing down with his No. 2 receiver Emmanuel Sanders, who is returning from a strained quad and is looking for his first catches in a Broncos uniform.

3. Give Brock a chance: Most starters are expected to play the first half. Manning might be an exception. Backup quarterback Brock Osweiler could use one or two series with the No. 1 offense before halftime.

4. Tune up for Indy: For most starters, this will be their final game experience before the Broncos open the season on Sept. 7. For the likes of Von Miller, Montee Ball and Kevin Vickerson, this will be their first game test since last season.

5. Stay healthy: Any injury suffered in the preseason feels like an injury for no reason. There already have been two significant injuries: Danny Trevathan (broken leg, out first three games) and returner/receiver Jordan Norwood (ACL, out for season). As the Super Bowl reminded the Broncos, a team is only as good as its depth.
