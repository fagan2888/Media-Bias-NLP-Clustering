Equal Pay Day is a date chosen each year to symbolize the period of time it takes for women\u2019s wages to equal that of men\u2019s from the year before, according to the National Women\u2019s History Museum. The fact that this day even exists is embarrassing for the whole country and should anger women.\n\nThe very next day, Senate Republicans added insult to this day by filibustering the Paycheck Fairness Act. This act would\u2019ve forced employers to show that the wages they set aren\u2019t based on a person\u2019s sex and ensure that people could openly talk about their wages or ask employers about their pay. Yet, it was struck down.\n\nPresident Barack Obama took the initiative on Equal Pay Day to sign an executive order that sets the mandates in the Paycheck Fairness Act in place with government contractors, which is a good start, but more needs to be done.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, lawmakers who filibustered the act claimed it was redundant because of legislation in place, such as the Equal Pay Act of 1963. However, it is absolutely necessary to pass the act because women still aren\u2019t being paid the same as their fellow male employees.\n\nForbes reported U.S. Census Bureau found that women were paid 77 percent of what men made during this decade. The U.S. Department of Labor also reported the pay gap between men and women is causing \u201chundreds of thousands of dollars in lost wages.\u201d\n\nIf a woman has a job in which she is putting in the same amount of time and effort as her male counterpart, there\u2019s no question that their pay should be equal. There are obviously still loopholes to previous legislation that must be fixed with the passing of the Paycheck Fairness Act to ensure women are paid equally.\n\nOf course it\u2019s not surprising it was shot down with this Congress being so unproductive and partisan and also with midterm elections approaching. It\u2019s disappointing and embarrassing that Congress can\u2019t even agree on an issue that should be a no-brainer, politics aside.\n\nI\u2019m ashamed that women are still being wronged in the workplace in 2014.\n\nBecause this has been made into a political issue, doesn\u2019t it also backfire on Republicans who opposed it by giving them a bad image? With midterm elections approaching, I don\u2019t see why they think it\u2019s smart to block this act with a filibuster when it will most likely deter female voters.\n\nAccording to CBS News, GOP Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers talked in her weekly address about how her party believes it\u2019s wrong if a woman is wrongly being paid less.\n\nShe then said, \u201cBut for women across America, it\u2019s not just about equal pay. It\u2019s about achieving a better life. And the Republicans are acting on solutions to make that happen.\u201d\n\nHow are they \u201cacting on solutions to make that happen\u201d when they\u2019re filibustering an act that would greatly benefit women? It\u2019s contradictory, and it doesn\u2019t make sense to me. I just don\u2019t understand how a congresswoman would oppose this act.\n\nIt\u2019s sad to think this couldn\u2019t be passed in today\u2019s modern society because of partisan opposition, especially when statistics show there\u2019s a disparity in pay. The fact that Equal Pay Day exists proves more needs to be done.\n\nI expect opposition and debate regarding issues such as the Affordable Care Act, but not for equal pay for women. I\u2019m embarrassed for and disappointed with Congress for being so unproductive and divided on an issue that obviously needs addressing.\n\nSend your thoughts to Jacqueline at technician-viewpoint@ncsu.edu.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Technician", "description": "April 8 was Equal Pay Day, which represents how far women had to work into 2013 to earn what men earned in 2012, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity.
