(Source: KPHO/KTVK)\n\nFirefighters with the North County Fire and Medical District delivered flowers to more than 50 widowed women on Valentine's Day.\n\nThe women are residents of the Brookdale Sandridge Senior Living Facility in the Sun City area. In general, they only see firefighters when there is an emergency.\n\nValentine's Day, however, was different -- for everyone.\n\n\"It gives us an opportunity to show our admiration for the elderly and their lives that they lived, Brookdale Home Health spokeswoman Jamie Sherman said. \"It will be a nice change to visit the people that we serve, in a capacity in which we see a smile on their face instead of fear on their face.\"\n\nThe ladies were thrilled to see the crews.\n\n\"We usually see them coming in with a stretcher so it's nice to see them with flowers in their hands and a smile on their face,\" resident Jan Speranske said with a laugh. \"That's good for them and good for us.\"\n\nThis is the first time the firefighters have spent Valentine's Day with the women, and it might become a new tradition.\n\nCopyright 2016 KPHO/KTVK (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation).
