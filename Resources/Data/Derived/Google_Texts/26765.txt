This weekend, some local Civil War reenactors are commemorating the 1863 St. Andrews Bay Salt Raid.

Union Navy soldiers landed in Panama City to take salt supplies from Confederate troops.

The reenactors are committing to their roles this weekend; sleeping on site in tents and eating what they make over the fire.

Those participating say they do it to give families a unique look at history.

"The kids are really interested and even the adults are interested, said Mark Bailey, one of the reenactors. "When they come in, they ask questions about how they lived, how the soldiers stayed. We have our own tents and our own equipment that we bring with us. We even have our own landing craft and our own boat."

The Salt Raid Camp will be open throughout the weekend.

Sunday, the camps will open at 10 a.m. and at 1:00 p.m. there will be another reenactment.
