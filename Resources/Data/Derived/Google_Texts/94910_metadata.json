A rig employs about 110 people.\n\n\u201cNot going away\u201d\n\nStatewide, the oil and gas sector employs just 1.2 percent of the workforce and losses in that sector may be offset by growth in others, said Mark Vitner, an economist with Wells Fargo Securities.\n\n\u201cThe price of oil isn\u2019t going up to $100 anytime soon,\u201d Vitner said. \u201cSo we\u2019d expect the slowdown to be more pronounced later this year. \u2026 But the industry is not going away.\u201d\n\nThe nine operators \u2014 which, based on state data, produced at least a million barrels of oil each in 2014 \u2014 are projected to spend up to $4.6 billion in Colorado in 2015, down from $6.6 billion last year.\n\nThe spending numbers were compiled by The Denver Post from company U.S. Security Commission filings, investor presentations and interviews.\n\nIn addition to the spending cuts, operators are trying to improve their efficiencies \u2014 focusing on drilling in the areas with the best yields and getting better prices for materials and services.\n\nMost operators hire oil field service companies, such as Baker Hughes and Halliburton, for drilling and hydrofracturing, or fracking, which pumps pressurized fluids into wells to crack rock and release oil.\n\nBaker Hughes and Halliburton, both based in Texas, have announced worldwide layoffs totaling 13,000.\n\nThe combination of horizontal drilling and fracking in tight shale formations has enabled Colorado to more than double its oil production in the past four years to about 82 million barrels in 2014.\n\nThe activity is centered in the Denver-Julesburg Basin, which stretches from Denver to the Wyoming border, and the Wattenberg field, within the basin.\n\nMaterials, services\n\nOperators are now getting lower prices for materials and services, said Craig Rasmuson, chief operating officer of Platteville-based Synergy Resources Corp.\n\n\u201cThe services companies are giving better prices and are willing to have smaller margins to keep operating and keep their people employed,\u201d Rasmuson said. \u201cWe are all sharing the pain.\u201d\n\nSynergy is the one company among the nine big drillers planning to increase its capital spending in 2015. Company officials expect to boost spending to $180 million this year from $160 million in 2014.\n\nAnadarko, the largest operator by production, is cutting its Colorado budget by about $600 million, to $1.8 billion.\n\nThat 25 percent reduction is less than Anadarko\u2019s cut of one-third for its companywide capital budget.\n\n\u201cThe Wattenberg continues to be one of the more attractive assets in our portfolio,\u201d Chuck Meloy, an Anadarko vice president, said during an investor conference call Tuesday.\n\nIn 2014, Anadarko averaged 12 to 14 rigs. The average in 2015 will be nine rigs, spokeswoman Olsen said.\n\nNoble Energy, the second-largest producer, is cutting its budget for 2015 to $900 million, down 40 percent from 2014, the company said.\n\nNoble had 10 rigs running in 2014. The company is projecting four rigs in 2015, and they will be working in northeastern Weld County \u2014 far from residential areas.\n\nSynergy estimates that drilling near homes adds 3 to 5 percent to the cost of wells because of extra noise mitigation and landscaping requirements, Rasmuson said. On the high side, it can add 10 percent to the cost.\n\nIn a February conference call with stock analysts, Noble Energy CEO David Stover called those drill sites \u201cour best economic areas.\u201d\n\nIn addition to focusing on high-yield areas, Stover said the company will increase the length of some of its horizontal wells to as much as 9,000 feet.\n\nThe longer wells cost more to drill but yield more oil and a better return on investment.\n\nSynergy, Denver-based Bill Barrett Corp. and Denver-based PDC Energy also are looking to drill longer wells this year, according to the companies.\n\n\u201cThe economics on those wells is improving,\u201d said Michael Edwards, PDC Energy senior director of investor relations.\n\nPDC Energy said it will cut its spending about 14 percent in 2015 to $435 million.\n\nDelaying completions\n\nAnother strategy operators are adopting is drilling wells but not fracking or \u201ccompleting\u201d them.\n\nDepending on the length of the well and the number of stages needed to complete it, a frack job can cost between $1 million and $1.7 million, according to figures cited by companies in their presentations.\n\nThe total cost of a standard well ranged from $3.3 million to about $5 million based on company presentations.\n\nAnadarko said it is delaying completion of 70 wells in Colorado.\n\nHouston-based Carrizo Oil and Gas is cutting activity and deferring some completions, company CEO Sylvester Johnson told stock analysts in a February conference call.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re waiting to see how far service costs will decline,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nCarrizo is forecasting a 65 percent cut in Colorado spending in 2015 to $37 million, running one rig and one fracking crew.\n\nCalgary-based Encana Corp., the third-largest Colorado operator, plans to spend $170 million to $200 million in 2105, about a third less than last year, said company spokesman Doug Hock.\n\nThis year, Encana will run one rig drilling seven to 12 wells, compared with six rigs and up to 60 wells in 2014, Hock said.\n\nEncana went through a companywide restructuring and cut jobs in 2013. No further cuts are expected, Hock said.\n\nBill Barrett Corp. said it plans to cut its 2015 budget by more than half, to between $240 million and $280 million.\n\nFaced with oil at $50 a barrel, bringing on more production \u201cjust doesn\u2019t seem to make good business sense,\u201d Bill Barrett CEO Scot Woodall told analysts in a February call.\n\nDenver-based Whiting Petroleum Corp. is cutting its Central Rockies budget about a third to $384 million.\n\nBonanza Creek Energy, based in Denver, is trimming spending by 36 percent overall, with just under $400 million for its Wattenberg operation, according to a company presentation.\n\nQuoting T. Boon Pickens, Bonanza Creek CEO Richard Carty told stock analysts \u201cit has become cheaper to look for oil on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange than in the ground.\u201d\n\nMark Jaffe: 303-954-1912, mjaffe@denverpost.com or twitter.com/bymarkjaffe", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nine big Colorado oil, gas drillers reel in spending, steady production", "title": "Nine big Colorado oil, gas drillers reel in spending, steady production", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/06/nine-big-colorado-oil-gas-drillers-reel-in-spending-steady-production/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150306__20150308_K3_BZ08OILECONJPICp1.jpg", "height": 397}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150306__20150308_K3_BZ08OILECONJPICp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-06T19:46:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T00:27:37+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf916\"", "article_summary": "Carrizo is forecasting a 65 percent cut in Colorado spending in 2015 to $37 million, running one rig and one fracking crew.\nDelaying completionsAnother strategy operators are adopting is drilling wells but not fracking or \u201ccompleting\u201d them.\nAfter a year in which dollars and oil from drilling rigs flowed freely into Colorado, the nine major drillers on the Front Range are slashing 2015 spending by 30 percent, about $2 billion.\n\u201cWe are all sharing the pain.\u201dSynergy is the one company among the nine big drillers planning to increase its capital spending in 2015.\nThe spending numbers were compiled by The Denver Post from company U.S. Security Commission filings, investor presentations and interviews."}
