Barrels are strewn about inside the storage room of Bouchaine Vineyards in downtown Napa, Calif., after a 6.0-magnitude earthquake struck the area north of San Francisco at 3:20 a.m. PDT Sunday. The quake caused damage to roads and buildings, ignited fires and sent more than 100 people to a hospital with non-life threatening injuries â€” prompting California's governor Jerry Brown to declare a state of emergency.
