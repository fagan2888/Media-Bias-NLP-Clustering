When we met, he told me he was separated, and I later learned they still lived together due to financial reasons. Reportedly, the reason for the separation was that she had a years-long affair. The first couple of years were ridiculous: He wasn\u2019t completely honest with me, I accused him of lying to me about being separated, etc.\n\nSince he moved out two years ago, our relationship has been GREAT. We get along, have a lot in common and always have a great time together. I am at the point of wanting to move forward with our relationship \u2014 after all, it has been nearly four years.\n\nWhen I recently asked him when he intends to get a divorce, he was very defensive (although my timing was terrible \u2014 we\u2019d been out drinking). A couple of weeks later, he (unprompted and out of the blue) vowed to \u201cwork hard\u201d on getting the divorce done so \u201cwe could be together all the time\u201d (we do not live together).\n\nSo far, I have seen no evidence of his \u201cworking hard\u201d to get divorced. I think he feels bad because he carries the medical for his wife and she has no insurance available through work. But she can get Obamacare now!\n\nWhat do you make of this? Fear of commitment? Not wanting to deal with young children again? Embarrassment because (he probably knows) I make more than twice what he makes, or maybe he has a lot of debt and he doesn\u2019t want to have the \u201cfinancial discussion\u201d? Is it time for an ultimatum \u2014 I hate to pressure him, I want him to WANT to marry me!? Thanks!\n\nFuture?\n\nSo, he lied \u2014 and not a white lie, but a marital-status whopper; he gets defensive about sensitive topics; you need a couple of belts before you can broach a sensitive topic yourself; you know nothing certain of each other\u2019s finances; you haven\u2019t talked about or don\u2019t believe what he\u2019s said to you about having children; you haven\u2019t received any insight from him about why he\u2019s moved so slowly on dissolving this marriage . . .\n\n. . . but you have a lot in common (indeed) and have a \u201cgreat time.\u201d\n\nThis is coming out meaner-spirited than I intended, but I\u2019m in full wow. You just sound so achingly unprepared for marriage.\n\nBefore going in, you need to trust each other implicitly and feel comfortable saying what you need to say \u2014 and that\u2019s just one of many ingredients for a healthy marriage. You don\u2019t appear to be even close to that point with each other.\n\nWhat you\u2019re doing in your letter is just mentally running through various scenarios to try to figure out what he is thinking and why, and apparently you\u2019re relying on that as your primary mode of communication. That\u2019s how people end up marrying someone who has ideas and goals that are completely different from their own.\n\nFind a way to talk to each other, about everything and anything, no more lies and no more rationalizations. When you actually know how he feels about insurance, income, kids, divorce and commitment \u2014 because he has told you himself \u2014 then write to me about wanting to get married.", "article_metadata": {"description": "They don\u2019t talk about finances, kids or why his divorce still hasn\u2019t happened; are they ready to talk about nuptials?", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/carolynhax", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "They don\u2019t talk about finances, kids or why his divorce still hasn\u2019t happened; are they ready to talk about nuptials?", "title": "Carolyn Hax: She\u2019s thinking about marriage (pay no attention to those lies and doubts)", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/carolyn-hax-shes-thinking-about-marriage-pay-no-attention-to-those-lies-and-doubts/2014/12/22/17afb378-80ba-11e4-81fd-8c4814dfa9d7_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/WashingtonPost/Production/Libraries/Common/StandingArt/Comics/2014-12-23/HAX141223.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@carolynhax"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/carolyn-hax-shes-thinking-about-marriage-pay-no-attention-to-those-lies-and-doubts/2014/12/22/17afb378-80ba-11e4-81fd-8c4814dfa9d7_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Carolyn hax, hax, ask Carolyn hax, Carolyn hax column, Carolyn hax advice column, Carolyn hax live, Carolyn hax bio, who is Carolyn hax, Carolyn hax advice, hax advice column, ask Carolyn, Carolyn hax tell me about it, dear Carolyn, Carolyn hax archives, Carolyn hax archive, Carolyn hax online, carolynhax, Carolyn hax chat, Carolyn hax columns", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/carolynhax"}, "eomportal-uuid": "17afb378-80ba-11e4-81fd-8c4814dfa9d7", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Carolyn hax, hax, ask Carolyn hax, Carolyn hax column, Carolyn hax advice column, Carolyn hax live, Carolyn hax bio, who is Carolyn hax, Carolyn hax advice, hax advice column, ask Carolyn, Carolyn hax tell me about it, dear Carolyn, Carolyn hax archives, Carolyn hax archive, Carolyn hax online, carolynhax, Carolyn hax chat, Carolyn hax columns"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaf32\"", "article_summary": "Find a way to talk to each other, about everything and anything, no more lies and no more rationalizations.\nWhen we met, he told me he was separated, and I later learned they still lived together due to financial reasons.\nThat\u2019s how people end up marrying someone who has ideas and goals that are completely different from their own.\nI am at the point of wanting to move forward with our relationship \u2014 after all, it has been nearly four years.\nThe first couple of years were ridiculous: He wasn\u2019t completely honest with me, I accused him of lying to me about being separated, etc."}
