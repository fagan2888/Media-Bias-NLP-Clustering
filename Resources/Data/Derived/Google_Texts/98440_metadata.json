With a challenge as complex as health insurance, the stakes are even higher.\n\nBetween fulfilling governmental guidelines, keeping costs at a reasonable level, and attracting and retaining high-quality employees, small businesses find themselves in a tenuous situation. To offer affordable health insurance that employees actually want, small businesses absolutely need creative solutions that level the playing field.\n\nBig businesses have long enjoyed the ability to offer robust group health insurance plans, which traditionally have provided a distinct advantage in the recruitment of talented professionals. However, the industry has changed. The Affordable Care Act and subsequent healthcare exchange are part of a new story for businesses that employ just a small number of people.\n\nIt\u2019s a story of affordable health insurance that fits each person\u2019s unique circumstances.\n\nNo two businesses \u2014 or individuals \u2014 are exactly alike.\n\nNo two businesses are exactly the same \u2014 and neither are any two people. Old-school group healthcare plans are just as complex, time-intensive, and inflexible for talented potential employees as they are for small businesses.\n\nDoes one size fit all for managers of companies both large and small? No. In the same vein, no two employees have the same mix of medical, dental, and vision needs.\n\nBe flexible and offer freedom.\n\nToday, people seek a personalized experience in everything from dining out to ordering shoes. Those expectations are no different regarding healthcare and insurance coverage.\n\nIt\u2019s about meeting a person\u2019s specific needs without paying for anything unnecessary \u2014 especially considering the drastic changes in premiums over the past several years. The $17,545 average annual family premium in 2015 is 27% higher than in 2010 and 61% higher than in 2005, according to a report by the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nForward-thinking, flexible approaches to small-business health insurance utilize what\u2019s available, maximize benefits, and reduce waste for each employee and employer. For instance, Zane Benefits uses the proliferation of individual policy options in the marketplace to provide highly cost-effective Defined Contribution Health Plans.\n\nDefined Contribution Health Plans are an affordable alternative to employer-sponsored group health insurance plans, largely because they give freedom and control to individuals while allowing small businesses to offer tax-free medical reimbursements.\n\nBusinesses and individuals find savings in the same place.\n\nWith the emergence of Defined Contribution Health Plans, large companies no longer hold all the power when it comes to benefits packages. The ZaneHealth online solution allows for a collaborative process that yields sizable cost savings for small businesses and the people who work for them.\n\nThe company sets a monthly allowance \u2014 based on a variety of personalized factors \u2014 that accrues in each employee\u2019s healthcare balance.\n\nEmployees use a private exchange or insurance marketplace to choose a policy with coverage and benefit levels that are right for their unique needs.\n\nThe company uses the ZaneHealth software to reimburse employees for their health plan costs, up to their account balance.\n\nReimbursements are tax-free, saving money for employees and the company alike.\n\nConclusion\n\nAt a time when implementing a group insurance plan is increasingly costly and complicated, Defined Contribution Health Plans are proving to be the cost-effective solution small businesses have been looking for to stay competitive and attract the high-quality professionals they need.\n\nWeigh in with your opinion.
