authorities to seize a person\u2019s weapons for 21 days if a judge determines there is potential for violence.\n\nProposed in the wake of a deadly May 2014 shooting rampage by Elliot Rodger, the bill provides family members with a means of having an emergency \u201cgun violence restraining order\u201d imposed against a loved one if they can convince a judge that this person\u2019s possession of a firearm \u201cposes an immediate and present danger of causing personal injury to himself, herself or another by having in his or her custody or control.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe law gives us a vehicle to cause the person to surrender their weapons, to have a time out, if you will,\u201d Los Angeles Police Department Assistant Chief Michael Moore told a local NPR affiliate. \u201cIt allows further examination of the person\u2019s mental state.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Best states for concealed carry \u2014 ranked worst to first\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a short duration and it allows for due process,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for mental health professionals to provide an analysis of a person\u2019s mental state.\u201d\n\nRodger, 22, killed six people and injured 14 others before taking his own life during a wave of attacks across Isla Vista near the campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara, that he carried out with two knives and three handguns that he legally purchased.\n\nThe rampage was prefaced by a video uploaded to YouTube of Rodger discussing his plans, as well as a 107,000-word manifesto, both of which were circulated minutes before he began killing.\n\nPHOTOS: Hand cannons: The world's most powerful handguns\n\n\u201cThis is almost the kind of event that\u2019s impossible to prevent and almost impossible to predict,\u201d Janet Napolitano, the university\u2019s president and a former homeland security secretary, said in the aftermath of Rodger\u2019s ambush.\n\nTwenty months later, implementation of the bill is expected to give family members a mechanism for having loved ones briefly lose access to their own, legally acquired weapons in hopes of stopping similar rampages.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the family members, it\u2019s the people closest to the perpetrator, who are in the best position to notice red flags,\u201d Wendy Patrick, a San Diego State University professor and lawyer, told San Diego\u2019s CBS affiliate this week.\n\nSecond Amendment advocates have cried foul, however, and insist that legislation is not the answer in a state already ripe with gun rules that are more restrictive than most anywhere else in America.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need another law to solve this problem,\u201d Sam Paredes, executive director of Gun Owners of California, told The Associated Press. \u201cWe think this just misses the mark and may create a situation where law-abiding gun owners are put in jeopardy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gun control legislation going into effect in California next
