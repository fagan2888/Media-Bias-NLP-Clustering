She has regular checkups. She has cut her blood sugar in half. She no longer needs to inject herself with insulin.\n\nThe model of medical care that is helping Garcia is built on a highly personal approach to patients and a high-tech system to track quality \u2014 something that is new for this city. A grim joke here long held that the best place to go for good healthcare was the airport.\n\nNow, Las Vegas is emerging as a test of how much a community can improve chronically poor health by expanding insurance coverage and using models of medical care pioneered in healthier places.\n\n\"We are a prime example of what people see as problematic about the American healthcare system,\" said Larry Matheis, the former longtime head of the Nevada State Medical Assn. \"That makes a lot of the ideas in health reform very attractive. \u2026 The challenge is going to be figuring out how to make it all work.\"\n\nWhen Nevada decided to guarantee state residents health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, a handful of doctors and civic leaders in Las Vegas began working to remake the way patients are cared for by adopting models of care pioneered in America's healthiest communities. (Christina House / For The Times)\n\nStarting this year, the Affordable Care Act guarantees insurance to tens of thousands of Las Vegas residents once effectively shut out of the health system. And leading hospitals, physician groups, unions and businesses are seeking to improve care by taking advantage of the coverage expansion.\n\nThe clinic Garcia visits has already inspired a similar facility in nearby downtown. And the Culinary Health Fund, a union health plan that runs Garcia's clinic, plans to build three more across the city.\n\nUnder another initiative in the city, a team of highly trained nurses is working to enhance medical care in nursing homes so fewer residents end up in the hospital.\n\nPoverty and obesity are not as widespread here as in some of America's other least healthy communities. Nevertheless, improving care in Las Vegas is an immense task.\n\nBefore Nevada expanded its Medicaid program under the new health law, nearly 30% of working-age adults in greater Las Vegas lacked insurance. By comparison, in U.S. communities with the best health outcomes, fewer than 1 in 10 are uninsured.\n\nThe area also has a critical shortage of primary care doctors \u2014 half as many relative to the population as healthier regions of the Northeast and upper Midwest.\n\nLas Vegas residents are far less likely than people in healthier communities to get cancer screenings, immunizations, blood-sugar tests and other recommended preventive care, even when they have a serious illness, according to data gathered by the Commonwealth Fund, a research foundation that studies healthcare systems.\n\nThey also are nearly twice as likely to die from illnesses that can be averted or controlled with timely medical care, including childhood measles, diabetes and colon cancer.\n\nOutcomes here match those in the poorest parts of the Deep South and Appalachia, according to a review of healthcare data The Times conducted with help from public health researchers and visits to communities from Maine to Hawaii.\n\nIn a system shaped by low levels of coverage, the city's for-profit hospitals historically have sought paying patients for more lucrative care. Freeways are lined with billboards advertising short wait times at emergency rooms, a profitable way for hospitals to cash in on patients with coverage.\n\nOne doctor would call his insured patients \"little ATMs,\" according to a physician who asked not to be identified in candidly describing a mindset he said is widespread in Las Vegas.\n\nMedicare patients here get three times as many MRIs, CT scans and other imaging tests as patients in parts of the Midwest and New England, data show. Overuse of imaging can be harmful to patients, though profitable for providers.\n\n\"There are no controls on anything,\" said Dr. John Ruckdeschel, an oncologist at the University of Utah who formerly headed the Nevada Cancer Institute.\n\nPatients shut out of the for-profit system often show up at the emergency room of University Medical Center, the city's overburdened public hospital.\n\nLast year, state regulators exposed hundreds of cases in which private hospitals dumped uninsured and Medicaid patients onto the public hospital.\n\nThe UMC waiting room fills daily with the city's uninsured, its poor, its mentally ill, its homeless and its immigrants. A doctor who works in what was once a supply closet juggles patients with sore throats and empty prescriptions so the ER can focus on life-threatening emergencies. In a corner, the hospital runs an improvised kidney dialysis center for immigrants who are in the country illegally.\n\nIf the crowded waiting room symbolizes the medical system Las Vegas is trying to leave behind, the Culinary Extra Clinic represents what many hope will be its future.\n\nThe Culinary Health Fund, which covers about 120,000 union members and their families, built the clinic in the shadow of the 100-story Stratosphere Casino Tower after concluding that much of the community's medical care was ineffective and wasteful. By focusing on its sickest members, fund leaders believed, they could cuts costs and dramatically improve health.\n\nHere, in a cheery medical office with the excited energy of an elementary school, doctors, nurses and social workers have turned the traditional doctor's practice on its head, delivering highly personal primary care instead of quickly churning patients.\n\nEach morning, team members with MacBooks gather at a big table in what they call the \"Huddle Room.\" A sign on the wall proclaims: \"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world,\" a quote from anthropologist Margaret Mead.\n\nThe team discusses the day's patients and those who have landed on the \"Who needs help\" list. The staff one morning debated how to help a patient with kidney trouble who was abusing drugs and another who had been controlling her high blood pressure but was back in the hospital.\n\nOutside the Huddle Room, a wall featuring snapshots of smiling patients celebrates milestones such as quitting smoking or reducing blood pressure.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Las Vegas tries new tactic to improve city's notorious healthcare", "date": "2014-06-07", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Teresa Garcia, weak and in pain, had all but given up on doctors when she came to a small clinic next to a former wedding chapel on the Strip.", "title": "Las Vegas tries new tactic to improve city's notorious healthcare", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-healthcare-change-20140608-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-539299ec/turbine/la-na-healthcare-change-20140608", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp12.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Las Vegas, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, Culinary Health Fund, health insurance, Medicaid,", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/80435493", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "Las Vegas, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, Culinary Health Fund, health insurance, Medicaid,", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "Las Vegas is emerging as a test of how much a city can improve chronically poor health by expanding insurance coverage for residents."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd913\"", "article_summary": "Before Nevada expanded its Medicaid program under the new health law, nearly 30% of working-age adults in greater Las Vegas lacked insurance.\nIf the crowded waiting room symbolizes the medical system Las Vegas is trying to leave behind, the Culinary Extra Clinic represents what many hope will be its future.\nNevertheless, improving care in Las Vegas is an immense task.\nNow, Las Vegas is emerging as a test of how much a community can improve chronically poor health by expanding insurance coverage and using models of medical care pioneered in healthier places.\n(Christina House / For The Times)Starting this year, the Affordable Care Act guarantees insurance to tens of thousands of Las Vegas residents once effectively shut out of the health system."}
