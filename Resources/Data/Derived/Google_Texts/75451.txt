A drug bust in south Meridian led to the arrests of three individuals. A fourth person is being sought.

The East Mississippi Drug Task Force says it served a search warrant at 2211 Grand Avenue in the south part of town.

Investigators say three people were arrested at the home and roughly $25,000 worth of drugs were seized.

Tommy Marquis Dunn, Lionel Hearn, and Micheal Anthony Wilson are all in custody. But Chief Deputy Ward Calhoun says at least one more suspect was still at-large.

"Derrick Moffite is a 30-year-old black male who stand approximately 6' 2" in height and is about 140 pounds. We ask the community's help in locating Derrick Moffite. If you know where he can be found, we'd appreciate if you would call the Crimestoppers line at 601-485-1860, or if you would call 911."

Moffite is wanted for at least six drug-related charges.
