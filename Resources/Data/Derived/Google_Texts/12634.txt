Here are four questions for Democrats that have no good answers:

What are you going to do about Syria? There is no plausible way of making substantial gains in Syria without committing to a full-scale invasion. And even that might not work. Like it or not, the real answer is that none of the candidates are going to do much about Syria.

How are you going to get a Republican Congress to cooperate with you? This isn't going to happen in any big way. It just isn't. There are some small-ball deals to be made, and even those are going to require a lot of grinding. Unfortunately this doesn't make a very inspiring campaign message.

How do we get Vladimir Putin to back off? The same way you get Donald Trump to stop talking: you don't. We're already doing nearly everything we can to pressure Putin short of going to war, and we're winning. Putin is desperate for some kind of victory, and nothing is going to stop him from occasional military adventures that are showy and impressive on the surface but fall apart if you dig half an inch down.

Why do you want to be president? The real answer is: to preserve Obamacare and prevent a Republican from appointing the next Supreme Court justice. Any other answer is just so much blah blah blah.
