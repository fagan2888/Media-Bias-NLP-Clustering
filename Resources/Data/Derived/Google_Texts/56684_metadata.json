And he intends to sign a presidential memorandum Thursday directing the Labor Department to propose rules that expand the number of employees who can get overtime pay.\n\nHe argues that some salaried workers are now paid less than the minimum wage.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d he said Saturday.\n\nObama\u2019s effort is just part of his so-called \u201cYear of Action\u201d and his larger, second-term agenda to close the income gap.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing everything I can, with or without Congress, to expand opportunity for more Americans,\u201d the president said Saturday, as he has said since his State of the Union address last month.\n\nObama has already used an executive order to increase the minimum wage for federal contract employees, and he has tasked the Democrat-controlled Senate to pass legislation that would increase the minimum wage for all Americans, from $7.25 to $10.10 an hour.\n\nThe president\u2019s efforts also serve his and fellow Democrats\u2019 political ends during this midterm election year, giving them a populist message that also includes a call for better pay among women.\n\nHowever, the proposed changes to overtime and minimum wage have drawn criticism for Republicans and Big Business.\n\n\"The president's policies are making it difficult for employers to expand employment,\" House Speaker John Boehner said recently. \"And until the president's policies get out of the way, employers are going to continue to sit on their hands.\"\n\n\"Similar to minimum wage, these changes in overtime rules will fall most harshly on small- and medium-sized businesses, who are already trying to figure out the impact of ObamaCare on them,\" said Marc Freedman, executive director of Labor Law Policy for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe overtime rules would be aimed at salaried workers who make more than $455 a week and those who are ineligible for overtime because they are designated as management even though their supervisory duties are minimal.\n\nThe rules do not require congressional action but could take more than a year to implement.\n\nIn Obama\u2019s memorandum to the Labor Department, he recommends new regulations that could increase the salary threshold for overtime eligibility and to change the definition of what constitutes a supervisor.\n\nThe salary-per-week limit separating those who get overtime and those who don't was increased to $455 in 2004 during the Bush administration. At the time, it hadn't been increased since the mid-1970s.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2015-01-30 09:54:16 EST", "dcterms.abstract":
