But the deal only pushed the deadline back a year to December 2017, and advocates hope lawmakers will use that time to debate Medicaid expansion.\n\nAnne Dunkelberg with the Center for Public Policy Priorities says there\u2019s no doubt the Medicaid waiver extension was good news for health care providers in the state, but says the state still has to update its Medicaid implementation in light of the Affordable Care Act's passage.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a terrible mistake to believe that it is going to change the ultimate course of sort of the modernizations of Medicaid that Texas needs to be looking at over the next few years,\u201d Dunkelberg said.\n\nThe sticking point in that Affordable Care Act fight hinges on reimbursement. The state wants a Medicaid waiver to pay hospitals for taking care of people without health insurance, but the feds argue an expansion Medicaid under the ACA could mean a drop in uncompensated care costs. However, state lawmakers have to approve that expansion, and the state's conservative leadership has opposed expansion and all other parts of the law since it was passed.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Garnet Coleman of Houston says it\u2019s time to revisit this conversation, and perhaps even find a middle ground by seeking an expansion \u201cthat respects the fact that we have conservative leadership in this state.\u201d\n\nColeman hopes Medicaid coverage expansion becomes a big part of the conversation as state and federal health officials continue to meet over what to do with the state\u2019s large uninsured population.\n\n\u201cThese are ongoing discussions and they have to be because of the 1.1 million people who don\u2019t have health insurance that could have it under a coverage expansion,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cAnd that is not solved until we figure out someway to work with our federal partners to do that. This is truly a band-aid for our hospitals, not a guarantee of a sustained dollars based on someone walking in with an insurance card.\u201d\n\nBut the fact that the state has been successful in getting the federal government to extend the waiver could make Medicaid expansion a harder sell. Already, the state\u2019s health care agency has said they hope to convince federal officials to give them yet another waiver extension after this one, says Bryan Black, a spokesman with the Texas Health and Human Services Commission.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, HHSC and [the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services] will continue to look at extending this possibly to another five years, we will just see how long that extension goes,\u201d he said.\"\n\nFederal health officials have warned that funding pools for programs in the state\u2019s Medicaid waiver will start being phased out in 2018. State lawmakers don\u2019t meet again until January of next year.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Now that Texas knows it will receive a Medicaid waiver for uncompensated care, state lawmakers are no longer on a tight deadline for figuring out what to", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kut.org/post/fed-money-buys-time-delays-hard-medicaid-choices-texas-lawmakers", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kut/files/styles/medium/public/201605/Medicaid-Expansion-3_jpg_800x1000_q100.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Now that Texas knows it will receive a Medicaid waiver for uncompensated care, state lawmakers are no longer on a tight deadline for figuring out what to", "title": "Fed Money Buys Time, Delays Hard Medicaid Choices for Texas Lawmakers"}, "story_id": 476725116, "twitter": {"site": "@KUT", "card": "summary", "creator": "@KUT"}, "author": "Ashley Lopez", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Fed Money Buys Time, Delays Hard Medicaid Choices for Texas Lawmakers"}, "nid": 14922, "datePublished": "2016-05-04", "keywords": "Medicaid, Medicaid 1115 Waiver", "wordCount": 541, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd35f3\"", "article_summary": "Federal health officials have warned that funding pools for programs in the state\u2019s Medicaid waiver will start being phased out in 2018.\nBut the deal only pushed the deadline back a year to December 2017, and advocates hope lawmakers will use that time to debate Medicaid expansion.\nState lawmakers don\u2019t meet again until January of next year.\nNow that Texas knows it will receive a Medicaid waiver for uncompensated care, state lawmakers are no longer on a tight deadline for figuring out what to do about its large uninsured population.\nHowever, state lawmakers have to approve that expansion, and the state's conservative leadership has opposed expansion and all other parts of the law since it was passed."}
