And while the Democrats may not always be all that, they\u2019re far better than these jokers, any day.\n\nA Republican Senate will destroy Obamacare, which, again, wasn\u2019t exactly what we wanted, but it was a heck of a lot better than what the GOP Congress is going to give us.\n\nAs for gay rights, in fact the Democrats have been all that and more. It took some work on all of our part, but we got sexual orientation added to the Hate Crimes law, we got \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d repealed, and we got the administration to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act. At the same time, Obama judges on the Supreme Court gave us the margin for victory that we needed to strike down DOMA, which has led to a flood of pro-gay-marriage decisions in courts nationwide. If you\u2019re gay, or care about gay rights, the Democrats in Congress and President Obama came through for us. And now it\u2019s time for us to come through for them.\n\nSo, yeah, I\u2019m going to vote Democratic on November 4. Our country paid a dear price the last time we gave Republicans control of the Congress (George Bush\u2019s rubber-stamp lemmings come to mind). Let\u2019s not do the Time Warp again.\n\nHere are the videos, if you like them, please share them. Thanks, JOHN\n\nHouse Version:\n\nPersonalize funny videos and birthday eCards at JibJab!\n\nIn case it wasn\u2019t obvious, the players in the House video are Paul Ryan, John Boehner, Michele Bachmann (soon to be gone, but never forgotten), Aaron Schock, and directing the happy lemmings, David H. Koch (of the Koch Brothers). You can share the House version with friends via this page.\n\nSenate Version:\n\nPersonalize funny videos and birthday eCards at JibJab!\n\nAs for the Senate, in order of appearance: John McCain, Mitch McConnell, Marco Rubio, Lindsey Graham, and their ringmaster, Ted Cruz. You can share the Senate version with friends via this page.\n\nAnd here\u2019s a fun third version, apropos of nothing:\n\nPersonalize funny videos and birthday eCards at JibJab!\n\nAnd finally, appearing in this video are Aaron Schock, Larry Craig, Rick Perry, Lindsey Graham, and Marcus Bachmman (beloved husband of Michele). You can share the apropos-of-nothing version with friends here.\n\nHere\u2019s one more that I liked. It might even be my favorite.
