He bet on himself in the eleventh hour and hit the mark. Because if he never would have made it long enough for Detroit to acquire him, everything that came after that never would happened.\n\nAnd for every young player now, it\u2019s the first and most important lesson to absorb.\n\n\u201cHe got traded, he got traded, he got traded,\u201d Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy for Chauncey Billups, it wasn\u2019t easy. Everybody wants instant gratification. They want things yesterday. He is a great example of: It doesn\u2019t happen overnight.\u201d\n\nMalone wants his players to understand that, over all else. The process is the process. For some it moves faster than others. Nikola Jokic rises from a minimal role while Jusuf Nurkic fights through frustration. Both can end up in the same, successful space. But only if they persevere through the process.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants all of their rookies to be great,\u201d Malone said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen. Unless you\u2019re LeBron James. Kobe (Bryant) struggled as a rookie at times. So, it doesn\u2019t happen. Staying with it, working hard, persevering. That\u2019s a testament to Chauncey Billups\u2019 strong mental toughness that he was able to do that and have his number retired in The Palace.\u201d\n\nBillups endured this:\n\n\u2022 1997: Drafted by Boston.\n\n\u2022 1998: Traded by Boston to Toronto.\n\n\u2022 1999: Traded by Toronto to the Nuggets.\n\n\u2022 2000: Traded by the Nuggets to Orlando.\n\n\u2022 2000: Signed as a free agent with Minnesota.\n\n\u2022 2002: Signed as a free agent with Detroit.\n\nSix teams. Five seasons. Three trades.\n\nThat kind of uncertainty breaks players all the time. Billups admits it almost broke him too. The third pick in the draft is supposed to thrive, not be discarded over and over and over again.\n\nThe Pistons, however, treated him like the treasure he knew he was.\n\nSpotlight on \u2026\n\nEmmanuel Mudiay, G, Nuggets\n\nWhen: We will call this an all-star edition of The Denver Post\u2019s NBA player of the week. And with a performance both expected and unexpected in the Rising Stars Challenge, Nuggets guard Emmanuel Mudiay is the pick.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: Friday night, as part of All-Star Weekend activities in Toronto, Mudiay scored 30 points, dished out 10 assists and made three steals for the World team, which lost 157-154 to the U.S. team.\n\nBackground: For one night, Mudiay didn\u2019t have to worry about setting up everyone else before himself, and he went out and just played. Scoring 30 points wasn\u2019t a huge surprise \u2014 particularly during a game in which 154 points were scored by Mudiay\u2019s team. But his improved shooting from the 3-point line was surprising. Mudiay, who has struggled on 3-point attempts this season, knocked down five of his 10 shots behind the arc Friday. Baskets from the 3-point line accounted for half his 30 points. And with a lot of talent around him, the rookie guard still ran the show and handed out 10 assists.\n\nDempsey\u2019s take: The shame of it all? Mudiay wasn\u2019t included among the final three players in consideration for the game\u2019s MVP award. But it was good to see him play freely and with confidence. If any of that is able to translate back to his day job \u2014 running the Nuggets \u2014 Mudiay\u2019s performance to open up All-Star Weekend could be a nice jump-start to the remainder of the season.\n\nIt was at that time his eyes were opened to the lesson that would later become the biggest takeaway of his career. Billups realized he needed that process. He needed to have patience.\n\n\u201cI was finally ready,\u201d Billups said. \u201cAt so many of those other stops, I just wasn\u2019t ready. I wasn\u2019t who I needed to be as a player, which is why a lot of times teams moved on from me. It never a character thing or a personal thing. My game wasn\u2019t ready.\n\n\u201cWhen I had the ability to come here (to Detroit), I was finally ready.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey @denverpost.com or @dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Dempsey: The biggest takeaway from Chauncey Billups\u2019 career: Patience rules all", "title": "Dempsey: The biggest takeaway from Chauncey Billups\u2019 career: Patience rules all", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/13/dempsey-the-biggest-takeaway-from-chauncey-billups-career-patience-rules-all/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-13T17:06:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:38:12+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Christopher Dempsey"}, "article_summary": "\u201cHe got traded, he got traded, he got traded,\u201d Nuggets coach Michael Malone said.\nScoring 30 points wasn\u2019t a huge surprise \u2014 particularly during a game in which 154 points were scored by Mudiay\u2019s team.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy for Chauncey Billups, it wasn\u2019t easy.\nIt was at that time his eyes were opened to the lesson that would later become the biggest takeaway of his career.\nMudiay wasn\u2019t included among the final three players in consideration for the game\u2019s MVP award."}
