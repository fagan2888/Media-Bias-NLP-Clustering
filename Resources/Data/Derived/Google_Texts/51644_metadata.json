The company has not fared well as the affordable care act has rolled out.\u201d\n\nA statement on Assurant Health\u2019s parent company\u2019s website said the following:\n\n\u201cThe company expects Assurant Health to report a net operating loss for the quarter in the range of $80 million to $90 million. Approximately half of the loss is attributable to a reduction in 2014 estimated recoveries from the Affordable Care Act (ACA) risk mitigation programs. The remainder reflects elevated claims on 2015 ACA policies.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of people who lost their insurance or didn\u2019t get insurance on the exchange signed up for Assurant products. And a lot of those people were not, it was a sicker population. It was a higher risk population and the company lost money on that,\u201d said Kirchen.\n\nThe Milwaukee Workforce Development Board staff will provide Rapid Response services to the affected workers.\n\nWorkforce Development Dislocated Worker Services Summary\n\nThe Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development (DWD) Dislocated Worker Program provides assistance to workers, companies, and communities affected by mass layoffs or business closings.\n\nUnder state law, employers employing 50 or more individuals in the state may be required to give 60 days notice before a mass layoff or closing. Once the state becomes aware of any event affecting 50 or more workers, the Dislocated Worker Program\u2019s Rapid Response Team reach out and offer assistance to the affected workers and employer.\n\nDWD Rapid Response staff will:\n\nVerify the event;\n\nSchedule an initial planning meeting with the company, union representatives and local service providers; schedule an orientation for affected workers;\n\nConduct an employee survey to determine services needed (usually done during orientation);\n\nAssist in applying for additional funds to provide increased services to the workers;\n\nCoordinate services among employment and training agencies.\n\nAffected workers have access to numerous services to help them become re-employed. Basic services, most of which are available to anyone at no charge through the state\u2019s Job Centers, include:\n\nJob search and career planning assistance, resume assistance, job training and access to job search databases.\n\nMore intensive and retraining services can become available for some workers under one or more DWD Workforce development programs. These intensive services can include:\n\nEligibility determination for programs, skills assessment, job search and placement assistance, career planning assistance, short term prevocational training and occupational training.\n\nDWD will also look at each dislocation to determine if the workers have lost their jobs as a result of foreign trade or competition. If that is the case, workers may be eligible for additional assistance for federal Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA). Services available under TAA include training, income support while in training, job search allowance and relocation allowance.\n\nWisconsin spends nearly $40 million annually serving approximately 20,000 dislocated workers in various programs.
