Obama would not be smiling for all of the speech. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nAt the prayer breakfast in 2013, he took his outrage public, criticizing Obama\u2019s policies while standing at a lectern a few feet from the president. Carson talked about the country being in danger of falling, like the Roman Empire, from \u201cmoral decay and fiscal irresponsibility,\u201d and he lambasted Obama\u2019s signature health-care overhaul. As the president\u2019s smile wilted into a grimace, a viral video and a conservative folk hero were born.\n\nArmstrong Williams, the conservative commentator who serves as Carson\u2019s business manager, was thrilled. \u201cWe\u2019re going to rachet it up,\u201d he remembered thinking.\n\nAnd they did. The newer, bolder Carson was on television comparing homosexuality to bestiality, causing such an uproar that he was forced to apologize. Then he called the president\u2019s health-care law \u201cthe worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.\u201d Many who admired him were stunned.\n\n\u201cSay it ain\u2019t so,\u201d Sharpton said were his first thoughts when he heard Carson\u2019s slavery comparison.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had black Republicans before, so it\u2019s not that he\u2019s on the right that is particularly surprising,\u201d Sharpton said. \u201cIt\u2019s that he\u2019s so far right.\u201d\n\nThat winter, a conservative activist named Mike Murray knocked on the door of Carson\u2019s new retirement home in Florida.\n\nCarson answered the door in shorts and a T-shirt. He invited him to the living room, and Murray sat near Candy Carson\u2019s organ. Over three hours, Murray told Carson he wanted him to be the face of an organization that would push for the repeal of Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about being too political,\u201d Murray remembers Carson replying.\n\nBut Murray was persuasive. \u201cPeople are hungry to hear from you,\u201d he said, \u201cand you could do this the right way.\u201d\n\nTogether, they ventured throughout the country, urging legislators and voters to sign a petition. Everywhere they went, Murray recalled, people told Carson that he was the right one to deliver the hard truths about the state of the country.\n\nCarson basked in their admiration. He said he began to believe that the country needed \u201csomeone who has been able to utilize the strength of lots of other people, as well as their own intellect, to solve problems that no one ever solved before. Maybe that would be a more useful skill set than time in Washington, D.C.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has to be someone,\u201d Carson thought, as he recalled it in an interview earlier last year. Then he chuckled. \u201cMaybe it just happens to be me.\u201d\n\nThen came a sign from the divine, according to Murray. The two men had agreed that Carson would call the 100,000th person to sign the health-care petition. The woman did not want her full name made public, Murray said, but he identified her in a mailer as a woman named Emily from Virginia.\n\nWhen Carson reached her, Murray said, she told the neurosurgeon that her dying son was once one of Carson\u2019s patients. He helped to save him. Now she wanted him to run for president to save the country.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Murray said. \u201cEveryone will think she was a plant.\u201d\n\nIn a February 2014 email to supporters, Carson wrote that he might have received \u201ca wink from above.\u201d\n\nThat November, Carson grabbed a voter registration form in Florida. In the party field, he checked \u201cRepublican.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson\u2019s shift from inspirational neurosurgeon to polarizing politician", "generator": "Piklist 0.9.9.7c", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Carson has risked his reputation as an accomplished neurosurgeon to run for president \u2013 a decision fueled by his sense of destiny.", "title": "Ben Carson\u2019s journey from inspirational neurosurgeon to polarizing presidential candidate", "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2016/01/02/deciderscarson/", "image": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/12/deciderscarson09.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "ben carson, gop, republican, presidential race, 2016, obama, herman cain, michael steele, clarence thomas, drudge", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "ben carson, gop, republican, presidential race, 2016, obama, herman cain, michael steele, clarence thomas, drudge"}, "article_summary": "Over three hours, Murray told Carson he wanted him to be the face of an organization that would push for the repeal of Obamacare.\nWhen Carson reached her, Murray said, she told the neurosurgeon that her dying son was once one of Carson\u2019s patients.\nEverywhere they went, Murray recalled, people told Carson that he was the right one to deliver the hard truths about the state of the country.\nPresident Obama listens to keynote speaker Ben Carson at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast in Washington.\nArmstrong Williams, the conservative commentator who serves as Carson\u2019s business manager, was thrilled."}
