Ber-nie!\u201d and \u201cFeel the Bern!\u201d, the candidate who, more than anyone else, has tapped into people power came to the stage to a tumultuous roar of approval from those gathered.\n\nHe wasted no time in launching into the issues that have resonated with millions of people around the county \u2014 the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on Citizens United, his stance against Wall Street and his tenet that his campaign is doing something totally different than most political campaigns.\n\n\u201cWe are telling the truth,\u201d he said to a roar of approval.\n\nHe also delivered a message to the millionaires and billionaires on Wall Street: \u201cNo, this country is not going to become an oligarchy. This country is a democracy!\u201d\n\nHe said the \u201crigged economy\u201d unfairly favors the wealthiest who do not need the help at the expense of those most vulnerable.\n\nA rigged economy is when \u201cworking people pay higher taxes to subsidize the wealthiest families in America,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cSo, I say to the Walton family: Pay your workers a decent wage and get them off welfare!\u201d\u201d\n\nHe was referring to the family that owns Walmart.\n\nHe called for a move to \u201cdemilitarize\u201d police departments, hold police accountable for crimes they commit and the need to make police departments look like the community they serve and protect.\n\nSanders also called for an end to the war on drugs. \u201cI have introduced legislation to take marijuana out\u201d of the list of most dangerous drugs.\n\nHe added that heroin and opioid addiction is a major crisis, but wants to address the problem as \u201ca health issue, not a legal issue.\u201d\n\nHe also pledged to increase Social Security benefits.\n\nHis campaign strengths\n\n\u201cThis campaign is listening to young people,\u201d the Vermont senator said. \u201cThey are the future of America.\u201d\n\nHe admitted older people don\u2019t flock to his campaign, but \u201cwe are doing phenomenally well with young people,\u201d and said his campaign has attracted more voters under 30 than Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump combined.\n\nThen he launched into a full-throated attack on the overwhelming student debt young people have and wondered, \u201cWhy are you punishing young people with outrageous levels of student debt?\u201d He said people should get all the education they need.\n\n\u201cWe must make public colleges and universities tuition-free,\u201d which elicted perhaps the biggest roar of the rally.\n\n\u201cI think it is time for a tax on Wall Street speculation, which will bring in more than enough money to make colleges and universities tuition-free.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are all tired of seeing Flint, Michigan where children are being poisoned,\u201d he said, pledging to invest $1 trillion in upgrading infrastructure around the country. And by doing that, he said, it will create \u201c13 million good-paying jobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will tell you what you already know but my Republican colleagues don\u2019t seem to know, and that is that climate change is real, it\u2019s human caused and it\u2019s already caused problems.\u201d\n\nHe pledged to move away from fossil fuels and in so doing will create \u201cmillions of good paying jobs.\u201d\n\nThe crowd roared again when he said \u201cHealthcare is a right, not a privilege,\u201d erupting into spontaneous chants of \u201cBer-nie! Ber-nie! Ber-nie!\u201d The Affordable Care Act, he said, is a good start. \u201cBut we have got to go further.\u201d\n\nHe then took aim at drug companies for their overcharging of life-saving medicines.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for us to move to a Medicare-for-all system,\u201d he said.\n\nThen he urged his supporters to caucus next Saturday because, he said, the math is clear: If his supporters turn out, he wins.\n\nThe crowd again roared as he left the stage to the strains of David Bowie.\n\nElsewhere in Washington and the West Coast\n\nSanders plans to also hold rallies in Seattle and Spokane on Sunday.\n\nAmong the people who arrived early at the Vancouver location were two 18-year-olds named Max \u2014 Max Van Arnam and Max Houser. They were both excited by the prospect of being at a Bernie rally.\n\n\u201cI support all the policies he\u2019s for and he fits my demographic,\u201d Van Arnam said. \u201cI really feel like he\u2019s a genuine person,\u201d Houser added. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with all his far left, radical positions but he\u2019s real.\u201d\n\nVANCOUVER: Hudson's Bay filling up w. @SenSanders supporters.
