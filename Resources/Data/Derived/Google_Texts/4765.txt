Coloradans can expect this “unsettled, wintry weather” to continue at least through Wednesday, the National Weather Service said Saturday, with several snowstorms moving across the state over the coming days.

In Denver, residents aren’t likely to see more than a light dusting of snow this weekend, but those living in or traveling through the mountains can expect a major storm — between 2 and 4 feet of snow in some regions, according to meteorologist David Barjenbruch.

“There will be a big variation in the snowfall across the state,” Barjenbruch said. “While Denver will see only light snow, it looks like the southwest and the San Juan Mountains will see several rounds of snow. In fact, we’re looking at significant accumulations over most of the mountains.”

Saturday morning, the Weather Service issued a hazardous weather outlook for parts of northeast and north central Colorado due to an arctic air mass.

In the metro area, the NWS online forecast shows a consistent chance of snow through Wednesday. While an inch at most is expected this weekend, Barjenbruch said several additional inches may be possible between Monday night and Tuesday night.

In the meantime, Denverites will have to stay bundled up as temperatures remain well below freezing.

“We’re way below normal,” Barjenbruch said of recent temperatures. “The normal high for today is 50, and so far today we have reached a high of 21 after a morning low of zero. We’re a good 20 to 30 degrees below normal across the area.”

Temperatures are expected to rise slightly by Monday, with an expected high of 39 degrees, but will return to the low 20s by Tuesday and the teens by Wednesday.

“After that, I think it’s what everyone in Denver will be looking forward to: a warmer and drier regime setting up as we head into later in the week,” Barjenbruch said.
