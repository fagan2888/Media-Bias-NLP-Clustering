Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on her program Wednesday to discuss the state of \u201cnegotiations\u201d between Democrats, including the White House, and Republicans in Congress. Burnett argued that Obamacare has become a GOP \u201cobsession\u201d and asked the senator why the Democrats\u2019 offer of a $988 billion spending cap wasn\u2019t \u201cenough\u201d to end the partial government shutdown.\n\nPaul said Republicans are doing their best to compromise with Democrats, but the Senate has rejected every single proposal from the U.S. House.\n\n\u201cWe started out with a position that we don\u2019t want any Obamacare,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president wants all of it, 100 percent. I would think a compromise would be both sides come off of their positions some.\u201d\n\nReferencing the Democrat proposal to implement a $988 billion spending cap in order to reach a long-term budget agreement, Burnett asked why it wasn\u2019t \u201cenough.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Harry Reid] is saying, \u2018look I thought you cared about long-term fiscal responsibility.\u2019 I mean he had a point there,\u201d she said, adding that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi also said they were agreeing to it even though they didn\u2019t want to.\n\n\u201cThey are giving you that. Why isn\u2019t that enough? It does seem like Obamacare is a bit of an obsession,\u201d Burnett added. She would also later ask, \u201cWhy put your entire heart, soul, reputation and next seat in office on Obamacare?\u201d\n\nPaul, calling out the CNN host in a very respectful way, responded by explaining why government is \u201cso messed up.\u201d He also reminded her that Congress controls the \u201cpower of the purse.\u201d\n\nHe said government shut down because \u201cwe aren\u2019t doing appropriations bills.\u201d If Sen. Reid had \u201cdone his job,\u201d he would have brought a number of appropriations bills to the floor and passed them to fund more of the government during the partial shutdown.\n\n\u201cTheir intransigence really is keeping the government shut down,\u201d Paul said.\n\nLater in the segment, Burnett played a clip of Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) attacking Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) for sparking the government shutdown, at least according to him.\n\n\u201cWhat do you say to that? There are a lot of Republicans who say that what this core group, a minority group, in your party is doing, is destroying your party,\u201d she said. \u201cPeter King is one of them, but he is certainly not alone.\u201d\n\nPaul said it was \u201cunfair\u201d because the Republicans are \u201cunited\u201d on Obamacare and feel \u201cit\u2019s bad for America.\u201d\n\nBurnett also cited a CNN poll that shows 60 percent of people want to avoid a government shutdown than delay or block Obamacare, 34 percent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not so sure it\u2019s as clear-cut as you make it out to be,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI think people, particularly the people who elected me, wanted me to stand up and fight Obamacare. They think it\u2019s bad. They think it\u2019s going to reduce their choices.\u201d\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 10, "twitter": {"description": "CNN anchor Erin Burnett invited Sen.
