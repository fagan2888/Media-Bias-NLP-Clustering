Markwayne Mullin represents a conservative district in a conservative state, but that didn\u2019t stop him from selling-out his constituents and voting for the hated \u201cCRomnibus\u201d spending bill.\n\nOf course Mullin\u2019s support for the bill probably had nothing to do with his recent appointment by Speaker Boehner to a seat the coveted House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nThose thirty pieces of silver aside, what is really most interesting about Markwayne\u2019s support for the CRomnibus has been the contortions, most normal Americans refer to it as lying, in which he has been engaged since casting his vote.\n\nMullin was particularly emphatic that the bill does not do what its plain language says it does \u2013 fund President Obama\u2019s unconstitutional attempt to grant amnesty to millions of illegal aliens.\n\nIn the aftermath of his betrayal of his conservative constituents Mullin made the standard argument in favor of selling out to the Washington special interests saying, \u201cAfter my team and I combed through the entire bill, we determined it contained measures that were incredibly important to our nation.\u201d And \u201cI can tell you the positives far outweigh the negatives. As with every bill, I approached this vote from first a constitutional perspective.\u201d And later, \u201cThis legislation in no way provides any funding to support the President\u2019s unilateral action.\u201d\n\nBut Mullin\u2019s most boldfaced lie came in an interview on Pat Campbell Show on Tula, Oklahoma\u2019s Radio KAFQ 1170 in which he explains that it's deceptive to say the bill funded Obamacare -- because Obamacare is funded just like Social Security and Medicare is (sic).\n\nHe goes on to say that the CRomnibus does not fund amnesty because the President hasn't issued his executive orders yet. \"Until you put it on pen and paper, there's nothing to fund or defund.\" Further, \"One of the major provisions that he said was that he's not going to deport. Well, not deporting someone -- there's no cost for that. There's a cost when you ship them out, back to their country.\"\n\n(links to this nonsense from Mullin at the end of the article)\n\nApparently Congressman Mullin and his crack team of future Chamber of Commerce lobbyists missed pages 128 and 129 and page 909 of the Rules Committee version of the bill.\n\nAs anyone who read the bill would know, on pages 128 and 129 (Rules Committee version) the bill provides the Department of Justice (DOJ) funds for the \u201cAdministrative review and appeals (including transfer of funds) \u201cFor expenses necessary for the administration of pardon and clemency petitions and immigration-related activities, $351,072,000, of which $4,000,000 shall be derived by transfer from the Executive Office for Immigration Review fees deposited in the \u2018Immigration Examinations Fee\u2019 account.\u201d\n\nThis directly provides $4 million to immediately process the paperwork necessary to implement amnesty for illegal aliens \u2013 and since it appropriates fees it also proves that House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers was just plain lying when he said that the House couldn\u2019t do anything to stop amnesty since the money came from fee-based accounts.\n\nNot only that, but on page 909 the bill grants millions of dollars to the Obama administration to educate and process the amnesty applications of the thousands of \u201cUACs\u201d or unaccompanied minor children that have flooded into the U.S. since Obama\u2019s amnesty plan became common knowledge on the streets of Central America.\n\nThis shameful betrayal America\u2019s workers and their families comes in the language on page 909 \u201cregarding UACs: English Language Acquisition\u201d where the bill appropriates three quarters of a billion dollars to educate immigrant children and youth and gives $14 million in special grants to states with at least one county that received 50 or more unaccompanied minors from the tsunami of amnesty seekers that washed up on our southern border earlier this year.\n\nSo, yes Markwayne, there is a cost if you don\u2019t deport illegal aliens, especially if they are children.\n\nAfter reading Rep. Markwayne Mullin\u2019s lies about the CRomnibus you should also ask yourself if Obama and his establishment Republican allies like Mullin are spending that kind of money educating illegal aliens, will those illegal aliens ever be sent back to their home countries, or will they stay here to use their federally funded education to compete with you and your kids for jobs?\n\nAmerica's workers and voters aren\u2019t nearly as dumb as \"Gruber Republicans\" like Markwayne Mullin think they are.\n\nWe urge you to go to our article \u201cWill You Fire The First Shot In The Battle To Govern America According To Conservative Principles?\u201d copy the letter to the editor and send it to newspapers, especially in GOP Rep. Markwayne Mullin\u2019s district. Show Mullin and other Republicans who voted for the \"CRomnibus\" that you are on to their lies and you won\u2019t be \u201cGrubered\u201d by the Republican establishment.\n\nHere\u2019s Markwayne\u2019s interview with the Pat Campbell show, long but so outrageous it is worth listening to.\n\nHere\u2019s Markwayne Mullin\u2019s post vote release in which he claims to have read the bill he clearly knows nothing about.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "ConservativeHQ.com", "title": "Dupe, Dope or Liar?
