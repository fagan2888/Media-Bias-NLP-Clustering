Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana have continued the damage limitation battle with an appearance on CNN – but failed to apologize for their controversial comments on “non-traditional families.”

The controversy began last week when the Italian Catholic designers said that "the only family is the traditional one" and that children born through in vitro fertilization were "synthetic.”

Following worldwide criticism and a call for a boycott by Elton John, Martina Navratilova and others, the former couple attempted to whitewash their comments.

Dolce said:

"I respect all the world, all the culture. I believe in the traditional family. It is impossible to change my culture for something different. You think what you think….I believe in the tradition of family.”

Gabbana added:

"We love gay couple. We are gay. We love gay couple. We love gay adoption. We love everything. It's just an express of my private point of view.”
