Why should Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning take a pay cut? At a salary of $19 million, he\u2019s a bargain. Put him on the open market, and some team will offer him $25 million. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to insult Manning by asking him to take a pay cut. With Manning, the Broncos finish 12-4 at worst in 2015. Without him, it\u2019s 8-8 max. Manning at 75 percent is better than almost any other QB at 100 percent.\n\nMike, protecting No. 18\u2019s bank account\n\nKiz: Let\u2019s see. Manning is ready and willing to play football. The Broncos want him back. But there\u2019s a process before a final decision can be made. Isn\u2019t that mysterious? Or maybe it\u2019s not. In pro sports, it\u2019s always about the money. Manning earns in excess of $12 million per year from endorsements. That\u2019s a lot of chicken parm. So let\u2019s say Manning restructures his contract to give the Broncos an extra $5 million in their effort to go from a 12-4 team to Super Bowl champs. Would that be a smart investment?\n\nGive Mr. Big Shot a shot. I couldn\u2019t agree more with you, Kiz, on the Nuggets needing Chauncey Billups in their organization.\n\nSeth, Denver\n\nKiz: Denver franchises certainly like to bring back Denver icons to rekindle the magic, from Elway to Patrick Roy. Perhaps the formula is a little tired. But if the Nuggets are truly serious about luring NBA free agents to Denver, who better to sell the advantages of living and shooting hoops in the Rocky Mountains than Billups? The team\u2019s front office is big enough for general manager Tim Connelly and Mr. Big Shot.\n\nSlow-pitch. Rockies pitcher LaTroy Hawkins is not concerned about the speed of the game. He said, \u201cWhy are we trying to rush this game?\u201d Well, I can tell you why. I have been watching baseball my entire life and love the game. But the reality is baseball has become molasses slow, and it\u2019s getting very boring for fans, especially when a batter insists on backing out of the box after every pitch.\n\nCathy, leads busy life\n\nKiz: Given the inability of Rockies pitchers to throw strikes and team ownership\u2019s reluctance to spend money to upgrade the pitching staff, we here at Kickin\u2019 It Headquarters humbly propose a radical idea: Eliminate the position of pitcher at Coors Field. Place a 36-inch-high rubber tee at home plate. Let batters place the ball on the tee. Grip it and rip it. So what if it would require 50 runs to win a game? Nobody in the party deck would notice after the third inning.\n\nWhat a deal, Dan. And today\u2019s parting shot is a salute to a success story that could happen only in America.\n\nDan O\u2019Dowd couldn\u2019t effectively draft, develop or evaluate talent for the Rockies, and he lands a job as a baseball analyst on TV. That\u2019s like a mechanic lecturing about brain surgery.\n\nJim, Parker\n\nMark Kiszla: mkiszla@denverpost.com or twitter.com/markkiszla", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kickin\u2019 it with Kiz: Peyton Manning pay cut a smart investment", "title": "Kickin\u2019 it with Kiz: Peyton Manning pay cut a smart investment", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/21/kickin-it-with-kiz-peyton-manning-pay-cut-a-smart-investment/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150214__peyton-manning-broncos-021415cp1-1.jpg", "height": 442}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150214__peyton-manning-broncos-021415cp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-21T23:50:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T23:48:18+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Kickin' It With Kiz, Peyton Manning"}, "article_summary": "Give Mr. Big Shot a shot.\nThe team\u2019s front office is big enough for general manager Tim Connelly and Mr. Big Shot.\nWhy should Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning take a pay cut?\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to insult Manning by asking him to take a pay cut.\nSeth, DenverKiz: Denver franchises certainly like to bring back Denver icons to rekindle the magic, from Elway to Patrick Roy."}
