But now, that timeline appears to have sped up.\n\nIn a new interview with Bloomberg BNA, DOL Secretary Thomas Perez said his agency is \u201cconfident we\u2019ll get a final rule out by spring 2016.\u201d\n\nWhy the sudden rush?\n\nThe Congressional Research Service, a branch of the Library of Congress, may have the answer.\n\nIt just released a telling report entitled, \u201cAgency Final Rules Submitted After May 16, 2016, May Be Subject to Disapproval in 2017 Under the Congressional Review Act.\u201d\n\nIt details a little-known mechanism by which the next Congress and president may be able to invalidate the DOL\u2019s changes to the FLSA exemption rule, if they don\u2019t arrive soon.\n\nMeet the Congressional Review Act\n\nThe Congressional Review Act allows Congress to disapprove \u201cmajor\u201d final rules promulgated by federal agencies \u2014 like the DOL.\n\nA major rule is defined as one that would have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. The changes to the FLSA exemption rules would qualify as major.\n\nThe act gives Congress 60 legislative session days to pass a joint resolution that would invalidate any major rule. If the rule is submitted to Congress with fewer than 60 session days remaining on the legislative calendar, then the next Congress will have a similar 60-day period to consider the rule.\n\nAnd according to the Congressional Research Service, if the DOL\u2019s overtime rule isn\u2019t released by May 16, the rule will be at the mercy of the next Congress and president.\n\nThe president can veto any joint resolution passed by Congress to invalidate a major rule \u2014 and President Obama would veto such resolution in this case. But if May 16 comes and goes without the new overtime rule being issued, it\u2019ll be out of his hands. And even if a Democrat wins the White House in November, the Congressional Review Act allows a two-thirds vote on the part of Congress to override a presidential veto.\n\nBottom line: The best chance the Obama administration and current DOL regime has of making their FLSA changes stick is to get them on the books before May 16. Otherwise, there\u2019s a good chance they\u2019ll be shot down if the GOP grabs the White House and maintains the majority in Congress.\n\nIt\u2019s worked only once before\n\nTo date, only one other rule has been successfully overturned as a result of the act \u2014 a 2000 Occupational Safety and Health Administration rule related to workplace ergonomics, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nSo having the DOL\u2019s final overtime rule overturned would almost be unprecedented. But in this case, it\u2019s easy to envision it playing out that way. If the GOP can muster up a supermajority in November\u2019s presidential election, you can bet the overtime rule will be put to the fire.\n\nThe Congressional Research Service did state its May 16 projection could change if the chambers of Congress deviate from the current legislative schedule put forth by party leaders. In other words, if legislative sessions are added to the existing calendar, the DOL would have more time to submit its final rule.\n\nStay tuned.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"description": "The buzz\u00a0out of Capitol Hill is telling\u00a0employers they\u2019ve got a lot less time to prep for the\u00a0DOL\u2019s new overtime exemption final rule.", "title": "Is DOL\u2019s new overtime rule coming sooner than expected?", "url": "http://www.hrmorning.com/dol-new-overtime-rule-coming-sooner/", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.hrmorning.com/wp-content/uploads/money-question-300x2531.jpg", "height": 253}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.hrmorning.com/wp-content/uploads/money-question-300x2531.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "keywords": "DOL, overtime, FLSA, rules", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-12T19:40:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-12T19:43:02+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "So having the DOL\u2019s final overtime rule overturned would almost be unprecedented.\nThe buzz out of Capitol Hill is telling employers they\u2019ve got a lot less time to prep for the DOL\u2019s new overtime exemption final rule.\nIf the GOP can muster up a supermajority in November\u2019s presidential election, you can bet the overtime rule will be put to the fire.\nA major rule is defined as one that would have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more.\nBut if May 16 comes and goes without the new overtime rule being issued, it\u2019ll be out of his hands."}
