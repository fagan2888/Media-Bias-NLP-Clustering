The company is betting that new features, alongside its security and management services, will make the devices stand out in the enterprise market against competing devices H-P accuses of being \u201cforce fit\u201d to meet business needs.\n\nThe devices include both tablets and so-called 2-in-1 devices that provide laptop-like functionality. The devices will run on Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system and Google\u2019s Android OS. H-P also is working with companies such as SAP SE and Cerner to build applications that cater to particular industries. The hardware will be backed up by H-P\u2019s security and services offerings, the company said.\n\nSteven Norton/WSJ\n\nAs mobile devices change the way people work \u2013 salespeople using tablets to pitch potential customers, or manufacturers using tablets on the factory floor \u2013 H-P says other products in the market are often \u201cforce fit\u201d into the enterprise with no real thought toward how it can actually help businesses. On top of that, they may be less secure and harder for CIOs to manage, the company said.\n\nBut for H-P, one challenge will be making sure it can provide that security and manageability while delivering value-add applications employees actually want to use. With the Microsoft devices from H-P, \u201cyou can have both, but the big assumption is that the applications that the companies want to use are available on the Windows tablet,\u201d said Neil MacDonald, a Gartner Inc. analyst who covers H-P. \u201cAt the end of the day it\u2019s the applications, it\u2019s not about the device.\u201d\n\nAmong the software in the works is an emergency responders dispatch app built by Intergraph and an enterprise asset management solution from SAP.\n\nThe devices reflect a push for collaboration between the soon-to-be separate companies, said Michael Park, vice president and general manager for H-P\u2019s commercial mobility and software unit. \u201cLet\u2019s start making this operational so that when the split occurs, we have a preferred partnership and we know how to work together,\u201d he said while standing next to Chris Moyer, CTO for H-P Enterprise Services. \u201cThat\u2019s how we behave. We\u2019re not going to change much.\u201d\n\nThe company said in October last year it would break into two separate publicly traded companies, seeing better long-term potential for corporate hardware and services business than for its printer and PC unit.\n\nWith the rollout, H-P is also betting on the growth of tablets in the enterprise. Mr. Park said tablets were a natural outgrowth from H-P\u2019s strength in the traditional PC market, but that down the road it could focus on smartphones, wearables or the sensors that power the Internet of Things. \u201cIf we\u2019re really thinking about what business mobility is in the future, it\u2019s about any screen size.\u201d He said they started with tablets because it could be extended from the strength of PCs, \u201ca baseline we could get out on.\u201d\n\nResearch firm IDC predicted global tablet growth would slow in 2014, led by the first full year decline in Apple\u2019s iPad shipments. Broadly, the market slowdown comes as lifecycles for tablets have gotten longer, looking more like those of PCs than smartphones. That said, Intel Corp. noted growth in its tablet business last quarter, and HP has managed to grow its personal systems business in a tough market.\n\nH-P also hopes the devices will appeal to companies preparing for the launch of Windows 10. \u201cEverybody in the PC segment, not only hardware vendors like H-P but their software and channel partners and certainly Microsoft, have very big hopes riding on Windows 10,\u201d said Charles King, president and principal analyst at Pund-IT.\n\nThe move comes after Apple and International Business Machines Corp. announced a partnership to deliver industry-specific applications for companies to run on Apple\u2019s iOS platform.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "For H-P, one challenge will be making sure it can deliver value-adding applications employees actually want to use, while providing the security and manageability critical to many CIOs.", "title": "Hewlett-Packard Rolls Out 8 New Toys in Mobility Push for Business", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2015/01/20/hewlett-packard-rolls-out-8-new-toys-in-mobility-push-for-business/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GN580_0120_c_P_20150120200904.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "CSuite", "article.headline": "Hewlett-Packard Rolls Out 8 New Toys in Mobility Push for Business", "description": "For H-P, one challenge will be making sure it can deliver value-adding applications employees actually want to use, while providing the security and manageability critical to many CIOs.", "article_section": "CSuite", "author": "Steven Norton", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "CIO Journal.
