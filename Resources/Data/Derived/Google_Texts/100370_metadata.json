It doesn't matter if a person is too thin, too fat, too this, or that, it's going to hurt, and we have to put a stop it.\n\nAsk a woman right this second, even some men, if they\u2019ve ever felt shame for being too thin, too fat, too slutty, too this, too that, and I guarantee you will be inundated with the number of instances they can recount. Hannah McGoldrick, associate editor for Runner\u2019s World, could tell you she\u2019s been told to eat a sandwich and looks anorexic. I myself could tell you classmates \u201ctook cover\u201d behind me during recess games and thought it reasonable to end arguments like, \"At least I don\u2019t weigh 300 pounds.\" While McGoldrick and I were physically targeted for different reasons, the way we felt afterwards was no doubt the same. Shame, no matter who it\u2019s targeted at, hurts really bad. And so, I want to be emphatic about the solution: shut up.\n\n\"Thin-shaming, fat-shaming \u2014 doesn't matter \u2014 it is all about shame. We have become a very mean society, and it is open season on women's bodies,\" Dr. Ramani Durvasula, a clinical psychologist and professor of psychology at California State University in Los Angeles, told Medical Daily in an email. \"Over 90 percent of women report dissatisfaction with their bodies. However, even when a woman achieves that comfort, the world is there to cut her down.\"\n\nShame Versus Guilt\n\nIt\u2019s called thin- and fat-shaming, not thin- and fat-guilt, because shame and guilt are distinctly different emotions. June Tangney, author of Shame in the Therapy Hour and professor of psychology at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va, told Medical Daily that when a person feels guilty, they say, \"I did a bad thing.\" When they feel shame, they say, \"I am a bad person for having done that.\"\n\n\"Guilt is much more fixable and amenable to change, but if you\u2019re talking about shame in regards to the self, it makes a person feel defective in some way. It\u2019s not fair,\" she said.\n\nBrene Brown, renowned shame researcher and author of the New York Times best-selling Daring Greatly, cited research in her TED Talk that found shame is highly correlated with addiction, depression, violence, aggression, bullying, suicide, and eating disorders, while guilt is inversely correlated with those things. Shame inspires people to escape and hide. People withdraw out of fear of being judged because what\u2019s at stake isn\u2019t their behavior. It\u2019s not how little or how much they seem to eat. It\u2019s their basic selves. \"The self becomes impaired, and we\u2019re generally just really wounded,\" Tangney said.\n\nShame is shame.

There may have been more emphasis on the \"public\" part in, say, 1700, but people have been privy to other people\u2019s off-handed comments and remarks for centuries. Hello, Hester Prynne, in Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019s The Scarlet Letter. Now, social media has made it painfully easy to come across the negativity, the haters, and the straight up trolls. Even more painful than that is the ongoing argument thin-shaming is worse than fat-shaming, and vice versa. Science complicates the matter when a lot of research only focuses on the harmful effects of fat-shaming; some of them being that overweight and obese female defendants are more likely to be convicted of a crime, and more likely to have a harder time getting hired and paid the same amount as their fellow employees.\n\n\"Body image is an easy target,\" Durvasula said. \"Women who are overweight are assumed to be slovenly, sloppy, and lazy, and women who are slender are assumed to be anorexic, underfed, and vain. And frankly, if a woman has a disorder, whether it is binge eating or anorexia nervosa, it is the height of cruelty to mock her and call her out publicly for it.\"\n\nShame is shame. Beyond that, a woman\u2019s body doesn\u2019t exist for you to comment on what it does or doesn\u2019t need, or what it is or isn\u2019t capable of. The recent cat-calling video from Hollaback, an international movement to end street harassment, is an example (however flawed) of how much people don't get that. It shows a portion of people who genuinely think it's OK to fall quietly in step with a woman after she's steeled herself against a person's comments. And even then \u2014whether it's ignoring the man or kindly rejecting him \u2014 she's subject to some form of shame, as shown by the recently launched Bye Felipe Instagram account. Like, what? \"This is what happens when we decline politely.\" Instagram/Bye Felipe/Screenshot\n\nThe truth is (and this is especially the case online) you don\u2019t know anything about a random person\u2019s life. Going back to McGoldrick, I\u2019m curious to know how the people who told her she looked anorexic felt when they found out she was, in fact, recovering from an eating disorder. While McGoldrick\u2019s essay fiercely asserted how comfortable she was with her body and how hard she continues to work toward being healthy, it could have easily gone the other way. What if one of those comments undid all her progress?\n\nStop Shaming\n\nThin- and fat-shaming don\u2019t stem from (as some crass definitions have described) a woman\u2019s or man\u2019s resistance to change or (lol) their identification with feminism. It doesn\u2019t matter what your body looks like, what your beliefs are, or how you were raised, Tangney said \u2014 every single woman and man is prone to shame. It\u2019s an actual thing, and it hurts women and men equally.\n\nThe antidote, according to Brown, is empathy. \"If you put shame in a Petri dish, it needs three things to grow exponentially: secrecy, silence, and judgment,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you put the same amount of shame in a Petri dish and douse it with empathy, it can't survive. The two most powerful words when we're [struggling]: me too.\"\n\nDurvasula added: \"The changes we need to see are more realistic media images, [starting to] value women for their minds and accomplishments, and raise public awareness of these eating disorders, and their depth and impact. Change can begin one woman at a time. And instead of shaming each other, we can support ourselves instead.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "opinion, shame, todays, society, what, it, means, and, why, it, absolutely, needs, stop", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Shame is a silent, yet ubiquitous emotion.
