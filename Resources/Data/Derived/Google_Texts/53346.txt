The Health Resources and Services Administrationâ€™s HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB) invites you to take a 10-15 minute online survey that will help the Bureau understand how best to organize and improve the HAB website and make it more useful for its users. This is part of the process to develop an improved HAB website that delivers consistent, streamlined and targeted content about the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program and Global HIV/AIDS Programs.

To access the survey, visit: http://hab.hrsa.gov/revampsurvey/ .The survey will be available through Friday, April 15, 2016.
