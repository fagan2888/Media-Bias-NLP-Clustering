Some of the hospitals on that list are also some of New Mexico\u2019s biggest hospitals.\n\nHow safe are hospitals across the United States? It\u2019s something the federal goverment is tracking a lot more closely in the last few years.\n\n\u201cWe help and support all the hospitals in the state to improve,\u201d explained Anne Timmins, Quality Improvement Director for HealthInsight New Mexico.\n\nThe nonprofit is under contract with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Department of Health to keep New Mexico hospitals on the right track.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also improving transparency,\u201d Timmins told KRQE News 13.\n\nStill, 758 hospitals across the country will face fines in 2016 for safety concerns. Six hospitals on the list are in New Mexico, inluding the University of New Mexico Hospital, Christus St. Vincent in Santa Fe, and Presbyterian in Albuquerque.\n\nA program under the Affordable Care Act, the government looks at things like on-site infections, complications, and customer satisfaction. \u201cA patient getting a blood clot after surgery, a hip fracture occurring in the hospital, a bed sore occurring while the patient\u2019s in the hospital,\u201d Timmins said.\n\nHospitals across the country now keep track, and turn in that data to the federal government. HealthInsight compiles the data and helps to implement changes and programs for the hospitals to improve overall quality of care.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing lots of different things to improve that and have seen those improvements, the numbers decline over time,\u201d explained Kathy Davis, RN and Senior Vice President for Presbyterian Hospital.\n\n\u201cThere is an additional burden to reporting, but we\u2019re committed to that,\u201d Davis told News 13. \u201cBecause we believe it\u2019s important to understand our performance, and to learn best practices.\u201d\n\nHospitals fined will receive one percent less from Medicare payments.\n\nPresbyterian is the only metro hospital on the list that sat down with News 13 for an interview.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very proud, and work really hard to deliver the best highest quality care,\u201d said Davis. \u201cWe\u2019re happy to work with a variety of organizations that bring expertise and help us improve,\u201d Davis added.\n\nPresbyterian, like other big hospitals, said more risk comes with more patients cared for. \u201cThe larger hospitals tend to take the more complex patients, and they do more complex surgeries, and they have the traumas,\u201d said Timmins.\n\nNo one from UNMH would go on camera with KRQE News 13, but a spokesperson pointed out UNMH is the only Level I Trauma Center in New Mexico. That means there\u2019s more of a chance for complications with extremely sick patients or complex cases.\n\nA spokesperson from UNMH sent KRQE News 13 the following statement:\n\n\u201cFor the Hospital Acquired Condition Reduction Program, UNMH is compared to all other hospitals in the country regardless of size or the types of patients for whom they provide care. UNMH is a tertiary care hospital, with the facilities and expertise to care for the most complicated illnesses and injuries. Other hospitals from across the state, which may lack the facilities or expertise to care for these very sick patients, regularly transfer them to UNMH, where they receive expert care in state-of-the-art facilities. It\u2019s important to note that many of the measures included in the Hospital Acquired Condition Reduction Program occur primarily in these extremely ill patients. Nevertheless, UNMH is committed to significantly reducing the occurrence of these complications and has implemented a number of quality improvement programs focused on the most important areas of patient safety, including hospital-acquired conditions.\u201d\n\nThe famed Mayo Clinic in Minnesota is also facing fines, as are Farmington, Shiprock, and Silver City hospitals. However, there are less New Mexico hospitals facing fines in 2016 than there were in 2015.\n\nCourtesy: RASHAD MAHMOOD / KUNM\n\n\u201cAnd it should get better,\u201d Timmins told News 13.\n\nNews 13 also reached out to Christus St. Vincent for comment. A spokesperson sent the following statement:\n\n\u201cAt CHRISTUS St. Vincent, we have made improvements in quality of care and patient satisfaction. Our commitment is to continue looking for ways to improve the care we provide our patients. This type of report and data helps us to further those efforts.\u201d\n\n30 New Mexico hospitals Hospitals Fined in 2015: 5 Hospitals Fined in 2016: 6 62 Arizona hospitals Hospitals Fined in 2015: 7 Hospitals Fined in 2016: 16 51 Colorado hospitals Hospitals Fined in 2015: 4 Hospitals Fined in 2016: 7 23 Nevada Hospitals Hospitals Fined in 2015: 7 Hospitals Fined in 2016: 13 34 Utah hospitals Hospitals Fined in 2015: 11 Hospitals Fined in 2016: 11\n\nSource: http://www.hcahpsonline.org\n\nCMS Star Ratings for New Mexico Hospitals CMS Star Ratings for Arizona Hospitals CMS Star Ratings for Colorado Hospitals CMS Star Ratings for Nevada Hospitals CMS Star Ratings for Utah Hospitals", "article_metadata": {"description": "The federal government is fining hospitals across the country for patient safety concerns.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488525050", "og": {"site_name": "KRQE News 13", "description": "The federal government is fining hospitals across the country for patient safety concerns.", "title": "New Mexico hospitals facing fines for safety concerns", "url": "http://krqe.com/2016/01/22/new-mexico-hospitals-facing-fines-for-safety-concerns/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://lintvkrqe.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/hs-presby.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The federal government is fining hospitals across the country for patient safety concerns.", "creator": "@krqe", "image": {"src": "https://lintvkrqe.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/hs-presby.jpg?w=640"}, "title": "New Mexico hospitals facing fines for safety concerns", "site": "krqe", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "D680B65910F40B115B0DE7298B906E56", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-tooltip": "Albuquerque News and Weather, Santa Fe, Rio Rancho, New Mexico | krqe.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.krqe", "fb": {"pages": 98691658081}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "KRQE News 13", "google-site-verification": "DybmyJ3qnLleDwi_e3uE6Wh_x8CKcwUamZdUxoElU1M", "keywords": "KRQExtra: Visual Data, Charts, Graphs Albuquerque - Metro, Health, Home, News, SmartTV, Top Stories, Top Video", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/krqenews", "published_time": "2016-01-23T04:59:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-23T05:14:58+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://krqe.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/8ec5fa807657323809caf8c9db73e4ed?s=16"}, "article_summary": "This type of report and data helps us to further those efforts.\u201d30 New Mexico hospitals Hospitals Fined in 2015: 5 Hospitals Fined in 2016: 6 62 Arizona hospitals Hospitals Fined in 2015: 7 Hospitals Fined in 2016: 16 51 Colorado hospitals Hospitals Fined in 2015: 4 Hospitals Fined in 2016: 7 23 Nevada Hospitals Hospitals Fined in 2015: 7 Hospitals Fined in 2016: 13 34 Utah hospitals Hospitals Fined in 2015: 11 Hospitals Fined in 2016: 11Source: http://www.hcahpsonline.orgCMS Star Ratings for New Mexico Hospitals CMS Star Ratings for Arizona Hospitals CMS Star Ratings for Colorado Hospitals CMS Star Ratings for Nevada Hospitals CMS Star Ratings for Utah Hospitals\nHowever, there are less New Mexico hospitals facing fines in 2016 than there were in 2015.\nThe nonprofit is under contract with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Department of Health to keep New Mexico hospitals on the right track.\nSix hospitals on the list are in New Mexico, inluding the University of New Mexico Hospital, Christus St. Vincent in Santa Fe, and Presbyterian in Albuquerque.\nStill, 758 hospitals across the country will face fines in 2016 for safety concerns."}
