Account and Membership Administration costs also decreased, by 5.3%, the first decrease over the past six years. These comparisons eliminate the effects of product mix and universe changes. The median costs for all products offered by these plans, before Miscellaneous Business Taxes, was $45.71 per member per month.\n\nPer member, Sales and Marketing costs declined by 2.4%. The Corporate Services cluster declined by 4.7%. The Medical and Provider Management function declined least, by only 0.8%. These growth trends eliminate the effect of product mix changes.\n\nMost functions declined and those declines comprised most costs. Provider Network Management and Services, Information Systems and Actuarial all significantly contributed to the overall decline.\n\nThese declines outweighed the most important change, on a weighted basis, the internal Sales function. As this function increased, per member broker Commissions decreased. For the continuously participating plans, Medicare membership increased by 17% as commercial membership was effectively flat. Approximately one-third of all eligible Medicare beneficiaries participate in the Medicare Advantage program.\n\nAdditional information was published recently in Plan Management Navigator, and is posted at www.sherlockco.com.
