Later we asked him what gave him inspiration for his poem \"Grieving in the Modern World.\" Here's what he wrote to us: \"I wrote this poem in between classes I was teaching at Elms College. I was sitting in my office and I was humming Billy Bragg and Wilco's version of Woody Guthrie's song for Ingrid Bergman. I started to write with an image of Ingrid Bergman in \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" in my mind and I let the language lead me to the tiny heartbreaks of the end of the day, and how we cope with them. I love the feeling of not knowing where I am going when writing, of not knowing where or when the poem will end. I never thought I would end a poem with NewsHour, but it was what this poem needed.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Monday on the NewsHour, banks and markets closed in Greece to prevent an economic collapse with one day left in its bailout period.
