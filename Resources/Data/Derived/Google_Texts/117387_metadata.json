In the month of February, he averaged 30.8 points per game on 57.5 percent shooting, 8.1 rebounds and 6.7 assists. The Sun-Sentinel reported that only one player in the history of the league ever had a month like that \u2013 Wilt Chamberlain in February 1966.\n\nDurant responded to LeBron\u2019s 61-point game with 42 against Philadelphia the next night, shooting 70 percent from the field and sitting out the fourth quarter. It was his 10th game of the season scoring 40 or more points.\n\nJames had led his Miami Heat to a 43-16 record, with their second best player, Dwyane Wade, missing 16 games. Durant\u2019s Oklahoma City Thunder are 46-16, with their second best player, Russell Westbrook, missing 30 games.\n\nDurant leads the NBA in scoring, averaging 31.8 points per game. LeBron is third, averaging 27.2 per game. LeBron is also 14th in the league in assists, averaging 6.4 per game. Durant is averaging 5.5 assists per game, and 7.7 rebounds, while LeBron is pulling down 6.9 rebounds per game.\n\nLeBron has won four NBA MVP awards over his career 11-year career, while Durant hasn\u2019t won any during his seven-year career \u2013 because, for the most part, LeBron has been winning them.\n\nThis race to the league\u2019s top honor has the feel of that year when Charles Barkley was named the league\u2019s MVP in 1993, in between Michael Jordan\u2019s five MVP honors. It was almost as if voters fatigued of giving it to Jordan, who had won it in each of the previous seasons. That may be in play again this season, as LeBron has garnered the award each of the two previous years.\n\nBarkley was a worthy candidate, but there was little doubt Jordan was the best player in the NBA. Durant is certainly a worthy candidate, but LeBron is, like Jordan, the best player in the league.\n\nAll that said, Kevin Durant should win the trophy.\n\nWhy? Because it means too much to LeBron James.\n\nLeBron is playing for legacy every night he steps on the court. It just so happens that he recognizes that NBA titles are a required part of a legacy, so he is trying to win them with the Heat. But MVP honors do as well, and LeBron has made it clear his mission is to carve out his legacy \u2013 see Mount Rushmore.\n\nBefore the NBA All-Star Game media hype, James told us his own idea of an NBA Mount Rushmore \u2013 temporarily, at least, until he takes his place on that mountain. He said the mountain as it stands now includes Jordan, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson and Oscar Robertson \u2013 but he said he would \u201cfor sure\u201d be on that Mount Rushmore someday. I guess someone is coming off.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising he left off such greats as Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell and Kareem Abdul Jabbar. After all, when LeBron changed his number from 23 to 6, he said it was because he wanted to pay tribute to Jordan \u2013 the ultimate number 23. But he chose 6, the number worn by Julius Erving and Russell, as if either one of them didn\u2019t warrant such tribute.\n\nRussell exposed LeBron during the All-Star Game when he reportedly delivered TNT\u2019s Craig Sager this quote for LeBron, \u201cHey, thank you for leaving me off your Mount Rushmore. I\u2019m glad you did. Basketball is a team game, it\u2019s not for individual honors. I won back-to-back state championships in high school, back-to-back NCAA championships in college. I won an NBA championship my first year in the league, an NBA championship in my last year, and nine in between. That, Mr. James, is etched in stone.\u201d\n\nRussell won five NBA MVP awards. If LeBron wins one more, he\u2019ll have five.\n\nI don\u2019t know what Durant thinks, but all things being equal, it seems like winning the honor for LeBron has an agenda attached with it. It means way too much to him. For that reason, Kevin Durant should be the MVP of the NBA.\n\n\u2022 Thom Loverro is co-host of \u201cThe Sports Fix,\u201d noon to 2 p.m. daily on ESPN 980 radio and espn980.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The race between LeBron James and Kevin Durant for the NBA Most Valuable Player award seems to be the only one in the NBA this season worth watching, even though there is more than a month left in the season to determine such honors.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The race between LeBron James and Kevin Durant for the NBA Most Valuable Player award seems to be the only one in the NBA this season worth watching, even though there is more than a month left in the season to determine such honors.", "title": "LOVERRO: Forget standings, MVP battle between James and Durant is what to watch", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/9/loverro-forget-standings-mvp-battle-between-james-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/07/thunder-suns-basketballjpeg-085e7.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/07/thunder-suns-basketballjpeg-085e7.jpg", "description": "The race between LeBron James and Kevin Durant for the NBA Most Valuable Player award seems to be the only one in the NBA this season worth watching, even though there is more than a month left in the", "card": "summary", "title": "LOVERRO: Forget standings, MVP battle between James and Durant is what"}, "Author": "Thom Loverro", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Lebron James, NBA, Nba, Russell Westbrook"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd865\"", "article_summary": "That, Mr. James, is etched in stone.\u201dRussell won five NBA MVP awards.\nBefore the NBA All-Star Game media hype, James told us his own idea of an NBA Mount Rushmore \u2013 temporarily, at least, until he takes his place on that mountain.\nLeBron has won four NBA MVP awards over his career 11-year career, while Durant hasn\u2019t won any during his seven-year career \u2013 because, for the most part, LeBron has been winning them.\nDurant is averaging 5.5 assists per game, and 7.7 rebounds, while LeBron is pulling down 6.9 rebounds per game.\nFor that reason, Kevin Durant should be the MVP of the NBA."}
