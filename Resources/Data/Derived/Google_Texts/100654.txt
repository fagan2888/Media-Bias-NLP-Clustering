In honor of Florida's Arbor Day, dozens gathered at the Panama City Beach Conservation Park Saturday.

It wasn't a morning of bike riding or walking, but a morning full of planting. Over the last few years the Long Leaf tree in Florida has slowly been disappearing.

Saturday, the public was invited to help restore them back into our ecosystem by planting 2,000 of them.

Dale Colby, the Resource supervisor of Panama City Beach Parks and Recreation Department said, "These trees will live four to five hundred years old, so they'll be able to come back as mothers, grandmothers and show their kids some of the trees that they planted. And so they take part in the park system just by planting these trees, and it brings them into the park system and they have ownership of it."

This is the 5th year the Panama City Beach Conservation Park has celebrated Arbor Day by planting trees.
