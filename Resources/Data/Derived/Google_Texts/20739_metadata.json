His advice was that if I could afford it, I should get it reinforced by mesh.\n\nI could finally afford it with my new medical insurance, Blue Cross, purchased through the \u201cMarketplace\u201d (ACA \u2013 \u201cObamacare\u201d) a few months later, so I proceeded. The surgeon who was recommended to me said exactly what my doctor told me \u2013 that it was not an urgent procedure but a choice to prevent something serious that might or might not happen in the future.\n\nSo, having determined that all costs related to the procedure would be covered, I got the surgery in late December of 2015, in Albuquerque. I was discharged almost immediately, a little too soon, according to some, and sure enough I was taken to the emergency room here in Las Vegas a couple days later, with a couple of painful complications.\n\nI was diagnosed, X-rayed, treated a bit, opiated and taken by midnight ambulance back to Albuquerque to the hospital which had hosted the surgery. I was there for a couple scary days before limping out and back to Las Vegas for several weeks\u2019 very slow and uncomfortable recovery\u2014which by the way is what the surgeon had promised me in the first place.\n\nMy point, though, is the costs, summarized here and rounded off, and excluding those under $1,000, and figuring out what\u2019s what as best I can from all the billing names that give no indication of what they are:\n\nSurgeon: $3,800\n\nRobotics technicians: $1,300\n\nAnesthesia: $1,600\n\nHospital operating room and pre-op visit: $6,600\n\n(Total so far: $13,300)\n\nNow, getting into the realm of the surreal, in my opinion:\n\nEmergency room in Las Vegas, approximately five hours: $21,300\n\nEmergency room physician (no surgery or anything dramatic): $1,700\n\nAmbulance ride to Albuquerque: $1,700\n\nNow, getting even more surreal, two days in Lovelace Hospital in Albuquerque; nothing dramatic, no surgery or \u201cprocedures\u201d: $87,500. (That\u2019s right, $44,000 per day!)\n\nTotal for this adventure: $125,500, figured conservatively.\n\nWas it \u201cworth it\u201d? Well, it\u2019s nice to have had the repair, but only if I were the successful mega-movie-producer I hope to be could I have afforded it myself, at those prices. Was it worth that much to \u201csociety\u201d\u2014us\u2014\u201cThe Government,\u201d who paid for it? I doubt it.\n\nWhy were the prices so ridiculously high? My understanding is that it\u2019s primarily to cover the costs of those who don\u2019t pay, due to being uninsured. No wonder Blue Cross had to leave the \u201cMarketplace!\u201d\n\nHow does every other industrialized society manage to have good-to-excellent medical care covered by a \u201csingle-payer\u201d system for everyone (ask people from those countries how good the medical care is or isn\u2019t; don\u2019t ask Rush Limbaugh et al)? An incredible mystery! It could have something to do with their lack of for-profit \u201chealthcare\u201d outfits, headed by CEOs making tens or hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\n\nA comparison:\n\nLet\u2019s compare the above to the experience of a local physician who shattered his elbow in a bicycle accident in Spain this past year. He was transported by ambulance to urgent care, then to hospital, given X-rays, a complicated four-hour surgery by a team of 10 people he (a physician) judged to be excellent, pinned and wired back together, and kept in hospital for three days of IV antibiotics due to the nature of the open contaminated fracture into the joint.\n\nHe was billed a total of $5,000, perhaps because he was not an EU citizen paying into the system. The cost here in the U.S. would have been at least what my total bill was, over $100,000!\n\nCall that \u201cSocialist,\u201d call it \u201cHerman,\u201d as my doctor dad used to say, but this remains the only country with a million people or more declaring bankruptcy every year due to medical bills, and millions staying in jobs they\u2019d rather not in order to have health insurance.\n\nThe solution won\u2019t come with Bernie Sanders or anyone else being elected, in my opinion, but by our facing the problem and the possibilities. And perhaps the solution for the problems with our local, formerly \u201ccommunity owned\u201d hospital lies in the same direction.\n\nJim can be reached at bluecanyon2@juno.com\n\nRelated\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Community Voices, Jim Terr", "original-source": "http://nmpoliticalreport.com/42361/costs-on-a-simple-medical-procedure-can-add-up/", "og": {"site_name": "The NM Political Report", "description": "Jim Terr is a singer/songwriter, documentary and film producer and satirist raised in Las Vegas, N.M.
