Olson told attendees that the delays were caused by missing subsidy data from the state insurance exchanges.\n\nAccording to Olson, the tax refunds have been \u201cheld for quite a long time, since the beginning of the filing season.\u201d For concerned taxpayers calling the IRS with questions, Olson said employees were instructed not to divulge information as to why their refunds are suspended.\n\n\u201cEarly this filing season, some tax returns that claimed the premium tax credit were briefly held for additional review,\u201d Ubon Mendie, spokesman for the IRS, said in a statement to The Daily Signal. \u201cAs of last week, the IRS is either processing these returns regularly or sending correspondence to taxpayers to obtain additional information.\n\nThose enrolled in the Affordable Care Act received tax credits based on their estimated income for 2014. However, now that customers have their actual incomes, they must \u201creconcile\u201d their subsidies with the IRS to ensure they received the correct amounts.\n\nSubsidies are calculated based on the price of the second lowest silver plan for each consumers\u2019 area, and the federal government provides taxpayers with information\u2014through a 1095-A form\u2014about the cost of those plans and how much they received in tax credits.\n\nAccording to National Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson, the IRS is delaying refunds for \u2018tens of thousands\u2019 of Affordable Care Act enrollees.\n\nFor states operating their own exchanges, the state-run marketplaces must provide the IRS with copies of the 1095-A forms so the agency can confirm taxpayers are using the correct information on their returns.\n\nThe Daily Signal reached out to all 14 state-run exchanges, the IRS and the Department of Health and Human Services for comment, but most did not respond to email and phone inquiries.\n\n>>> Obamacare Supporters, Critics, Clash at Supreme Court Over Law\u2019s Subsidies\n\nKathy Tallarita, spokeswoman for Connecticut\u2019s exchange, Access Health CT, told The Daily Signal the exchange mailed all customers their 1095-A forms by Jan. 30. However, there were \u201cminor\u201d glitches with documents received by approximately 3,600 customers. Access Health CT fixed those errors, and Tallarita said all issues were resolved by the end of February.\n\nHowever, she was unsure if the exchange sent the forms to the IRS.\n\nA spokesman with Idaho\u2019s exchange, Your Health Idaho, told The Daily Signal the state-run marketplace will be sending out 1095-A forms next filing season. Your Health Idaho used HealthCare.gov last year and therefore didn\u2019t issue the documents.\n\nThis tax filing season is the first since the Affordable Care Act\u2019s implementation. It is the first time consumers will have to reconcile the subsidies they received under the law. Last month, the federal government announced that close to 1 million HealthCare.gov customers received the wrong information on the 1095-A forms they sent out.\n\nRoughly 100,000 customers in California who purchased plans through the state\u2019s exchange, Covered California, experienced similar issues.\n\nGovernment officials requested those who were affected by the error to delay filing their taxes. For the 50,000 who already did so, the agency said they would receive additional information from the Department of the Treasury.\n\nEd Haislmaier, a health policy expert at The Heritage Foundation, told The Daily Signal the government\u2019s error could present issues for taxpayers, because they need the information to file their taxes.\n\n\u201cThese people will not be able to file their taxes, and they will be in limbo\u2013if they owe money, if they\u2019re getting a refund\u2013until all of this is completed,\u201d he said. \u201cSome probably will not be happy campers.\u201d\n\n>>> Commentary: The Damaging Effects of Obamacare", "article_metadata": {"description": "The taxpayers\u2019 leading voice at the IRS is warning that the tax agency is delaying refunds for \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of Obamacare enrollees.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The taxpayers\u2019 leading voice at the IRS is warning that the tax agency is delaying refunds for \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of Obamacare enrollees.", "title": "IRS Official Warns ACA Enrollees Could See Delay in Refunds", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock_000000191658_Medium.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-05T17:21:04+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1M9XrR4"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The taxpayers\u2019 leading voice at the IRS is warning that the tax agency is delaying refunds for \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of Obamacare enrollees.", "title": "IRS Official Warns ACA Enrollees Could See Delay in Refunds", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock_000000191658_Medium.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2015-03-05T16:25:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-05T17:21:04+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Internal Revenue Service, Affordable Care Act, National Taxpayer Advocate, Nina Olson, American Payroll Association, 1095-A, Department of Health and Human Services, Access Health CT, Covered California"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda13e\"", "article_summary": "According to National Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson, the IRS is delaying refunds for \u2018tens of thousands\u2019 of Affordable Care Act enrollees.\nThose enrolled in the Affordable Care Act received tax credits based on their estimated income for 2014.\nThis tax filing season is the first since the Affordable Care Act\u2019s implementation.\n\u201cAs of last week, the IRS is either processing these returns regularly or sending correspondence to taxpayers to obtain additional information.\nHowever, now that customers have their actual incomes, they must \u201creconcile\u201d their subsidies with the IRS to ensure they received the correct amounts."}
