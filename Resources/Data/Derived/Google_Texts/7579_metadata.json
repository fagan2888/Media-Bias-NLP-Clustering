CREDIT: Shutterstock\n\nMany doctors are talking to parents about the HPV vaccine in a way that actually makes them less likely to get their kids vaccinated, according to a new study published in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention.\n\nResearchers at Harvard and the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill assessed responses pediatricians and family physicians voluntarily provided to a national online survey. They rated the responses for five communication factors: whether the doctors told parents the vaccine was \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cextremely\u201d important, whether they recommended the vaccine by ages 11-12 for boys and for girls, whether they recommended it routinely or just to those whom they deemed \u201chigh risk\u201d, and whether they recommend the vaccine happen the same day as the appointment (which dramatically increases chances of vaccination).\n\nThe results are not encouraging. About half of physicians reported two or more practices likely to discourage timely HPV vaccination. Twenty-seven percent of physicians said that they did not \u201cstrongly endorse\u201d the vaccine. Forty-four percent did not recommend same-day vaccines, and a whopping 59 percent recommended the vaccine only to kids whom they deemed \u201cat risk.\u201d\n\nCREDIT: American Association For Cancer Research\n\nThe study\u2019s lead author, Melissa B. Gilkey, PhD, said that the results surprised her.\n\n\u201cWe are currently missing many opportunities to protect today\u2019s young people from future HPV-related cancers,\u201d Gilkey said in a press release from the American Association for Cancer Research. \u201cHelping providers communicate about the HPV vaccine effectively is a promising strategy for getting more adolescents vaccinated.\u201d\n\nThe rate of HPV vaccination in the U.S. hovers around 30 percent \u2014 far below that of other countries. There are a few reasons for the United States\u2019 lagging vaccination rates, including the misconception of the HPV vaccine as an STD treatment rather than a vaccine to prevent cancer, and a persistent \u2014 and disproven \u2014 myth linking HPV vaccination to increased sexuality. There is also harmful fear-mongering and suspicions of negative side effects, though the CDC has deemed the shots safe and effective.\n\nThis new research suggests another way to raise the HPV vaccination rate: Clear, strong communication from doctors about the importance of the vaccine for all pre-teen boys and girls, as recommended by the CDC. Prior studies have also confirmed that how doctors frame conversations with parents about vaccines has a significant impact on whether kids receive them.\n\nNearly all sexually active Americans will get HPV at some point in their lives, and while most people never know they have it, certain strains can lead to can lead to cancers of the cervix, throat, or anus. By preventing against the most dangerous strains of the virus, the HPV vaccine can dramatically lower the risk of these cancers. It is important for both men and women \u2014 for while cervical cancers in women can be detected early with regular Pap smears, there\u2019s no way to screen men for the neck and throat cancers that HPV can cause.\n\nEven the current low rate of vaccination has cut teen HPV rates in half. Public health officials want push for 80 percent of eligible girls to be vaccinated by the next decade. To achieve that goal, this research makes it clear that doctors must be part of that effort.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "In the study, about half of physicians reported two or more practices likely to discourage timely HPV vaccination.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "In the study, about half of physicians reported two or more practices likely to discourage timely HPV vaccination.", "title": "Why Don\u2019t Doctors Recommend The HPV Vaccine More Strongly?", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/10/22/3715003/hpv-vaccine-doctors-communication/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22113346/shutterstock_171527276.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In the study, about half of physicians reported two or more practices likely to discourage timely HPV vaccination.", "creator": "@RayOfLaurel", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22113346/shutterstock_171527276-320x213.jpg", "title": "Why Don\u2019t Doctors Recommend The HPV Vaccine More Strongly?", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22113346/shutterstock_171527276-99x66.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22113346/shutterstock_171527276-540x303.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-22T12:36:07+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/laurelAraymond"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc99a8\"", "article_summary": "Health Why Don\u2019t Doctors Recommend The HPV Vaccine More Strongly?\n\u201cHelping providers communicate about the HPV vaccine effectively is a promising strategy for getting more adolescents vaccinated.\u201dThe rate of HPV vaccination in the U.S. hovers around 30 percent \u2014 far below that of other countries.\nBy preventing against the most dangerous strains of the virus, the HPV vaccine can dramatically lower the risk of these cancers.\nAbout half of physicians reported two or more practices likely to discourage timely HPV vaccination.\nThere are a few reasons for the United States\u2019 lagging vaccination rates, including the misconception of the HPV vaccine as an STD treatment rather than a vaccine to prevent cancer, and a persistent \u2014 and disproven \u2014 myth linking HPV vaccination to increased sexuality."}
