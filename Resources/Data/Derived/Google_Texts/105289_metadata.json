Indeed, the whole community will face massive social engineering \u2014 for its own good, of course.\n\nAll of it is taking place under the guise of creating \u201chealthy communities\u201d through a public-private partnership between governments, health insurance giants, and businesses to create \u201cBlue Zones.\u201d Reading the slick marketing materials produced by the \u201cBlue Zones Project,\u201d which styles itself \u201ca community well-being improvement initiative designed to make healthy choices easier through permanent changes to environment, policy, and social networks,\u201d the whole plot can almost appear rather harmless at first glance. After all, what could be wrong with \u201cvoluntary\u201d initiatives and \u201cchoices\u201d to allegedly promote health, happiness, and well-being? Plus, the plan even urges you to drink wine, every single day!\n\nIndeed, even the name \u201cBlue Zone\u201d is a reference to communities around the world where people have been found to live longer, healthier lives. The term was popularized by author and National Geographic Fellow Dan Buettner, who studied the people in those communities to try to figure out what made them live longer than others. But what, exactly, is the Blue Zones Project? And what does it entail for an American community to become a Blue Zone? At least one element is clear: The sweeping program aims to involve everyone \u2014 from your boss to your sheriff to your children \u2014 and to \u201cnudge\u201d individuals into desired behaviors and values.\n\n\u201cThe Blue Zones Project is a systems approach in which citizens, schools, employers, restaurants, grocery stores and community leaders collaborate on policies and programs that move the community towards better health and well-being,\u201d it says on the outfit's website. \u201cWe implement long-term, evidence-backed policies and interventions that optimize environments within communities, nudging people towards healthier choices throughout their day.\u201d All of the \u201cprogress\u201d and \u201cnudging\u201d will be measured using surveys with the \u201cGallup-Healthways Well-Being Index.\u201d\n\nCities from Minnesota, Hawaii, and California to Florida, Oregon, Texas, and Iowa are in the Blue Zones Project's cross-hairs. But despite all of the talk about \u201cchoices\u201d and the project being \u201cvoluntary,\u201d the role of government in all of it is hardly a secret. \u201cMunicipal governments play a key role in Blue Zones Project by shaping policies and building infrastructure in a way that supports active living and healthier lifestyles,\u201d a \u201cBlue Zones Project Blueprint\u201d for Southwest Florida declares.\n\nCritics and parents in target communities, though, are expressing serious concerns about the developments, with the word \u201cOrwellian\u201d tossed out by more than a few opponents of the agenda. The scheming has also been attacked for parallels with a variety of other deeply controversial projects such as the Obama administration's \u201cfull-service community schools\u201d that aim to essentially replace parents, and the United Nations' infamous \u201csustainable development\u201d plot known as UN Agenda 21. A video of young school children singing the praises of the \u201cBlue Zone Project\u201d at school has also sparked alarm.\n\nSome opponents of the agenda, concerned about the secrecy and the comprehensiveness of the social engineering \u2014 especially as it relates to children and government schools \u2014 are now working to stop it with legal challenges. In Collier County, Florida, for example, one of the healthiest areas in America and also a target for becoming a \u201cBlue Zone,\u201d a lawsuit is currently underway aiming to quash the scheme based on a number of problematic elements associated with the program and the process used to foist it on the communities there.\n\nAfter learning of the plan, local parent and attorney Steven Bracci filed a lawsuit against Superintendent of the Collier County School District Kamela Patton over her involvement. In the lawsuit, Bracci argues that the Blue Zone Steering Committee, which she serves on, held meetings that were not noticed by or open to the general public at which policies and programs for the school district were decided. He also says that Patton has already started implementing Blue Zone plans relating to schools, and that the court needs to stop it.\n\n\u201cWhat better way for the government to accomplish our loss of liberty than to make it look like it is a 'grassroots' community wellness movement?\u201d asked Bracci in a statement provided to The New American. \u201cBlue Zones leader Allen Weiss calls these efforts 'grassroots,' but there is nothing 'grassroots' about this. It is being implemented by force, utilizing our government officials and self-proclaimed leaders who created a 'blueprint' outside of the sunshine, signed their names to it, and thereby seemingly pledged their efforts to deliver various agencies and organizations over to the 'greater collective good' of the Blue Zone special interest project.\u201d\n\nWhat is happening in Collier County offers some warnings to other communities targeted by the Blue Zones Project, and it provides some insight into what the scheme involves. Consider the \u201cBlue Zone Steering Committee\u201d for the county. It includes, among others, the school district chief, the head of the local Chamber of Commerce, the local NAACP chief, the county sheriff, various mayors, city and county commissioners, local media executives, bureaucrats, business leaders, and other self-styled \u201ccommunity leaders.\u201d In other words, government, business, and the non-profit sector will all be working together to \u201cnudge\u201d individuals into desired behaviors.\n\nEven the use of the word \u201cnudge\u201d has raised alarm bells among critics \u2014 partly because of its association with Obama's former \u201cRegulatory Czar\u201d Cass Sunstein, the Big Government extremist who co-authored Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness. The infamous figure, who styles himself a \u201clegal scholar\u201d and now teaches law at Harvard, came under intense fire for a variety of fringe ideas; pushing the notion that animals should have legal standing in the courts, for example. He also advocated a plan to have taxpayer-funded shills engage in \u201ccognitive infiltration\u201d of groups authorities disagree with, and even proposed a government \u201cban\u201d on \u201cconspiracy theorizing.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, the Obama administration's propensity for \u201cnudging\u201d Americans came under fire nationwide when a White House plot to create a \u201cBehavioral Insights Team\u201d for the express purpose of manipulating the public made headlines. According to an official document about the scheme aimed at recruiting personnel, the controversial team was supposed to \u201cnudge\u201d the U.S. population to think and behave in ways that Obama officials deem best on \u201csustainability,\u201d health, education, and more. Similar schemes to manipulate the public by U.K. authorities also drew criticism, as did a plot by the UN and Obama policy architect John Podesta to create a \"global partnership\" that would \"encourage everyone to alter their worldview, profoundly and dramatically.\u201d Under the \u201cBlue Zones Project,\u201d the government-backed nudging will cover almost every area of life, including religion.\n\nConsider a series of Blue Zone \u201ccheck lists\u201d for citizens produced by the initiative. The \u201cBedroom Checklist,\u201d for example, under \u201cdirection,\u201d tells participants to \u201cstart making changes to your bedroom environment based on the recommendations given.\u201d Those recommendations cover everything from your mattress and the \u201coptimal\u201d thermostat temperature to what you may have or not have in your bedroom \u2014 no phones, screens, or digital alarm clocks, for instance. \u201cUse the bedroom only for sleep and sex,\u201d the checklist adds. Talk about government in the bedroom!\n\nA separate \u201cHome Checklist,\u201d meanwhile, urges Blue Zones targets to weigh themselves daily, buy a dog, get rid of all TVs except one, ditch the TV remote, replace power tools with hand tools, buy a bike, use a helmet, disconnect the garage door opener, sit on the floor instead of furniture, and much more. All of that is supposed to help people burn more calories and become healthier.\n\nThe Blue Zones \u201cKitchen Checklist\u201d calls for portioning all snack foods into small bags, keeping fruits and veggies at the top of the refrigerator, replacing \u201coversized plates with smaller 10-inch plates,\u201d replacing \u201cbig gulp drinking glasses with narrow, cylinder shaped glasses,\u201d and hiding and labeling \u201cjunk food\u201d to avoid eating it. The list also says you should \u201cavoid eating family style by leaving the serving dishes on the counter,\u201d use hand-operated kitchen appliances rather than electric ones, and much more. All of those instructions are apparently supposed to help people eat less, and eat healthier.\n\nBeyond the checklists dictating just about everything in and around your home, another Blue Zones document, the \u201cTribe Check Up,\u201d helps you pick the \u201cRight Tribe\u201d to associate with based on lifestyles deemed healthy by the Blue Zone experts. After calculating the number of \u201cpoints\u201d you have earned based on your friends' healthy habits, the document calls on Blue Zone participants to \u201cnurture\u201d the healthy friends and \u201cspend as much time as you can with them.\u201d \u201cYou should still socialize with them,\u201d it says about the moderately healthy friends.\n\nThe not-so-healthy friends, though, should get the cold shoulder if possible, including friends who are obese or suffer from depression. \u201cThese people almost certainly are dragging your health behaviors down,\u201d it says. \u201cIf these aren\u2019t friends to whom you\u2019re committed or need your help, you might want to consider expanding your social network.\u201d In other words, Big Brother and his private-sector cronies want to help pick your \u201ctribe\u201d for you, too. When applied to the school setting, the prospects become even more bizarre, with some parents wondering whether children will be divided into \u201ctribes\u201d based on, among other criteria, their weight, eating habits, and health.\n\n\u201cThe name is soothing, much like green zones, but the goal is pure collectivism,\u201d wrote liberty-minded pundit Dr. Rich Sweir, a veteran, education expert, and entrepreneur. \u201c'Help make healthy choices' is code for control of individual behaviors.... The Blue Zone Project is the ideal that each man exists only by the permission of the group and for the sake of the group and the group alone.\u201d In other words, collectivism, Sweir said.\n\nThe lawsuit in Collier County aims to stop it all in its tracks. Because Florida law puts school boards in charge of education-related policies and programs, Bracci's suit argues that if proper procedures had been followed, parents and the general public would have had an opportunity to participate. \u201cInstead, the Superintendent has created and planned to implement these Blue Zone Project programs ... without ever seeking the consent or official action of the School Board.\u201d Even if the superintendent were to seek official approval from the board at this point, it will merely be in an \"after-the-fact review capacity\" months after the Blue Zone Steering Committee developed and decided on the policies.\n\nUnder the Florida Constitution and the state's \u201csunshine\u201d laws, all meetings by elected officials where public business is discussed or official acts are taken must be open to the public. The lawsuit argues that the Blue Zone Steering Committee and the superintendent tried to circumvent the process, and therefore, that all of its decisions, including the Blue Zone Project Blueprint for the area, cannot be considered binding on students or employees within the school district. More than a few critics in the county have also complained about the secret process and what officials may be trying to hide by keeping the public out of the loop.\n\nThe lawsuit goes on to argue that the community and its children are being subjected to an \u201cunproven 'social science experiment' about which the School Board knows very little.\u201d It also argues that there are a number of unanswered questions that must be publicly addressed. Among them: Who is behind the project? Who is funding it? What relationship does it have to any federal, state, or local government program; or political ideology? What financial impact will it have? In what ways will children be \u201cmonitored\u201d and \u201ctested\u201d for \u201csocial advancement\u201d and \u201cwell-being,\u201d as called for in Blue Zones literature? What are the rights of parents as far as opting their children out? What safeguards are in place to ensure that Blue Zone-promoted \u201cvoluntary choices\u201d do not become mandates?\n\nThe local newspaper, published by a Blue Zone Steering Committee member, has tried to downplay the suit, even quoting \u201cexperts\u201d who claimed it was a \u201cstretch.\u201d But the court is apparently taking it seriously, ordering the parties involved into mediation, and even setting a hearing on the motion for a temporary injunction set for early October if the dispute is not resolved before then. Whether or not the suit succeeds, though, concerns about the shadowy \u201cBlue Zones Project\u201d and its government-aided social-engineering agenda will continue to grow.\n\nAlex Newman is a correspondent for The New American, covering economics, education, politics, and more.
