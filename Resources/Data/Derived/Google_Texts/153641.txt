Last month, The Daily Signal interviewed America’s youngest elected state lawmaker. Saira Blair, an 18-year-old from West Virginia, won a seat in state’s House of Delegates in November. As she prepares to take office, Blair spoke to Yahoo Global News anchor Katie Couric about the Republican Party’s appeal to millennials.

“My core principles that I’ll never change are the fact that I’m pro-life, pro-2nd Amendment and pro-Constitution, for that matter,” Blair told Couric. “My generation is going to have $17 trillion of debt on our hands. And we deserve at least one vote in the House of Delegates.”

Couric also interviewed Raffi Williams, deputy press secretary of the Republican National Committee, and Bubba Atkinson, editor in chief of The Independent Journal Review.
