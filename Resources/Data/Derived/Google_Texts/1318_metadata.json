Enter the salary you'd be comfortable accepting. If you can add more details, consider qualifying that figure by adding something like, \"The minimum salary requirement specified is based on anticipated job responsibilities and workload and does not account for other forms of compensation.\"\n\n2. Give your base salary only. If you get in the door for an interview and salary comes up, explain that you provided your base salary and mention other ways you were compensated.\n\n3. If the job description specifies a desired salary range, enter a wide range such as $55,000 to $85,000. Be honest with yourself, though, that the low salary amount is something you can live with and would consider accepting.\n\n4. Get creative. \"If the form accepts alphabetical characters, I've heard people have success with typing in 'negotiable' and even 'confidential,' but most systems require numbers,\" says Joyce. In that case, your target salary number (hopefully realistic) or a zero seems to work best.\n\nSee also: Take these tests to find your new job\n\nWhen asked about salary in an interview, the best response is to say that while the position is not precisely the same as your last job, you would need to understand your duties and responsibilities in order to establish a fair salary for the job. \"Even if the job title is the same, it's seldom an apples-to-apples comparison,\" Joyce says.\n\nIf you are pressed to be more specific, ask what the salary range is and factor that in your response. So if the salary range is $50,000 to $60,000 and you want to make at least $55,000, you're probably best off asking for something between, say, $55,000 and $60,000.", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "The Best Way to Respond to Salary Questions During Your Job Search", "estimated_publish_date": "2016-01-29", "Last-Modified": "2015-06-22T16:35:20.006-04:00", "keywords": "salary negotiation, job hunt, job hunting, salary, job salaries, job search, workforce, job seekers, employers", "houseAds": "commercial", "paywallStatus": "off", "isArticle": "true", "author": "Kerry Hannon", "comments": "on", "source": "aarp_org", "type": "info", "description": "Effective salary negotiation tips to help job seekers establish their value as a worker to employers.", "s43": "27.JobTools|MyFinancialSecurity", "robots": "index,follow", "Subject1": "DCSubjects:Work and Retirement/Work/Labor Force/Job Market", "Subject2": "DCSubjects:Work and Retirement/Work/Job hunting/Job searches", "Subject3": "DCSubjects:Work and Retirement/Work/Employee benefits and wages", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "language": "english", "og": {"site_name": "AARP", "description": "Effective salary negotiation tips to help job seekers establish their value as a worker to employers.", "title": "Salary Negotiation and Job Search - AARP", "url": "http://www.aarp.org/work/job-hunting/info-2015/job-search-salary-negotiation.html", "image": "http://cdn.aarp.net/content/dam/aarp/work/job_hunting/2015-04/200-How-to-Handle-Salary-Questions.imgcache.rev1432044405761.jpg", "type": "article"}, "contentId": "/content/aarpe/en/home/work/job-hunting/info-2015/job-search-salary-negotiation", "fb": {"app_id": 114175878660191}, "aarpeContent": "true", "IALevel1": "work", "IALevel2": "job-hunting", "IALevel3": "info-2015", "action": "read", "dateToday": "2016-05-26"}, "article_summary": "If the job description specifies a desired salary range, enter a wide range such as $55,000 to $85,000.\nIf you are pressed to be more specific, ask what the salary range is and factor that in your response.\nSo if the salary range is $50,000 to $60,000 and you want to make at least $55,000, you're probably best off asking for something between, say, $55,000 and $60,000.\nIf you get in the door for an interview and salary comes up, explain that you provided your base salary and mention other ways you were compensated.\nIf you can add more details, consider qualifying that figure by adding something like, \"The minimum salary requirement specified is based on anticipated job responsibilities and workload and does not account for other forms of compensation.\""}
