To get pale, winter skin ready for the beach, lots of spring breakers make a few visits to a local tanning salon. Recent studies show around 30 percent of white high school girls tan at salons.\n\nMany new proposed state laws aim to reduce that number, but health advocates have found Missouri especially resistant to any legislation that gets between skin and UV bulbs.\n\nAt Electric Sun Tanning Salon in Lenexa, Kan., Heather Cooper guides newcomers through a skin type analysis to get them started on a tanning regimen. Many tanning salons, like this one, follow voluntary safety practices as well as state regulations.\n\nIn Kansas, salons are required to post safety warnings and provide those little goggles, among other rules.\n\nBut Missouri currently has no state laws or even regulations regarding tanning, and health advocates say more needs to be done to protect people like Abby Eckel.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I knew many people that didn\u2019t indoor tan,\u201d says Eckel.\n\nAbby Eckel went to Piper High School in Kansas City, Kan., class of 2007. It started as a way to get ready for a dance, but it wasn\u2019t long before, like a lot of her classmates, she was tanning every day.\n\n\u201cAfter softball practice, you would see every girl you just had softball practice with at the tanning salon,\u201d Eckel explains.\n\nThrough some ups and down, indoor tanning in the United States has continued to grow in recent years into a five-billion-dollar-a-year industry, thanks in part to teenagers like Eckel, who tan despite increasing numbers of reports linking indoor tanning with skin cancer.\n\n\u201cI thought of it as a lesser type of cancer that more people defeat, than, as opposed to lung cancer or breast cancer or something like that,\u201d Eckel says.\n\nIn fact, one person dies from melanoma, which is the most dangerous form of skin cancer, every hour in the US. One in five Americans will develop one kind of skin cancer at some time in their life.\n\nAs a dermatologist, Dr. Brunda Balaraman spends most of her time treating skin and diseases like skin cancer. She\u2019s currently finishing her residency at Barnes Jewish hospital in St. Louis, Mo. But she recently turned her scientific lens on the Missouri tanning industry.\n\nAs part of a study, she and a partner called hundreds of tanning salons across the state.\n\n\u201cWe portrayed ourselves as teenagers trying to get a tan,\u2019 says Balaraman.\n\nThey found that 43 percent of Missouri salon employees said there were no risks to indoor tanning.\n\nSixty-five percent would allow children as young as 10 or 12.\n\n\u201cWe were disheartened, but not completely surprised,\u201d says Balaraman. \u201cCause there have been other studies that have been done in other states without legislation, and it kind of mirrors some of the findings in other states.\u201d\n\nRecently, groups like the American Academy of Dermatology and the American Cancer Society have been pushing for new tanning laws. In 2014, many states are considering laws that would restrict teens from indoor tanning to one way or another. And in the past few years, several states banned teens from salons altogether. That\u2019s what some legislators have in mind for Kansas.\n\nIn Missouri, the charge for tanning legislation is being led by Representative Gary Cross (R \u2013 Lee\u2019s Summit, Mo.) His daughter, Melissa, had been a teenage tanner.\n\n\u201cShe was diagnosed with basil cell cancer on her forehead,\u201d Cross explains.\n\nCross is not what most people would call a rules-and-regulations kind of legislator. He\u2019s voted against regulations for dog breeders, against regulations on farmers, even loosened rules for home beer brewers.\n\nBut he believes indoor tanning is different.\n\n\u201cI have a small business background, and I am very passionate about small business,\u201d says Cross. \u201cBut I\u2019m also passionate about human life.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, Cross introduced what he hoped would be the state\u2019s first tanning law. It would\u2019ve required teenagers to get their parents\u2019 permission before tanning. It didn\u2019t pass. He tried again the next year and again the year after that.\n\nAnother law proposed in 2013 would\u2019ve barred children under 6 from tanning salons, but it didn\u2019t pass either.\n\nThis year, Cross has introduced a bill that would only require parental permission for teens sixteen and younger \u2013 pretty tame compared to what\u2019s being considered in other states. But it\u2019s still being met with some strong opposition.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve gone crazy over this whole thing,\u201d says Terri Wheeler, owner of the Sun Scene salon in Raymore, Mo.\n\nShe already requires parental permission for teen does not think a new law is needed.\n\nA lot of salon owners like Wheeler think they are being unfairly targeted by the new proposed laws and a ten percent tanning tax created by the Affordable Care Act. Salons owners say teens will tan whether or not they have easy access to salons.\n\nJoe Levy is scientific advisor for the American Suntanning Association. He says that creating restrictions will just drive teens to tan aggressively outside or to buy their own equipment.\n\n\u201cIf you check Craig\u2019s List and eBay \u2013 for several hundred dollars you can purchase a home tanning unit,\u201d says Levy. \u201cSo they are within the realm of affordable. And they will end up in garages and basements and teenagers will use them.\u201d\n\nDespite those concerns, the American Suntanning Association actually supports laws banning teens from salon.\n\nBut in Missouri, owners like Terri Wheeler aren\u2019t convinced that regulating the industry is a good move.\n\n\u201cI think lawmakers are overstepping their bounds in trying to say what our kids and families can or cannot do,\u201d says Wheeler. \u201cThey\u2019re over-controlling, and they need to stop it.\u201d\n\nInside a tanning bed, fans whirl away while light from 6-foot UV bulbs makes skin look blue. Plenty of teens will flock to these machines in the next few months, but Abby Eckel won\u2019t be one.\n\nShe gave up tanning for good last year after noticing some skin damage before her wedding.\n\n\u201cI will never set foot in a tanning bed again,\u201d says Eckel.\n\nFor Gary Cross, the next few months offer another chance to bring regulation to Missouri\u2019s tanning industry. But he says if his legislation doesn\u2019t pass this year, he\u2019ll keep bringing it back until it becomes law.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Every year about this time, teenagers everywhere hear the call of spring break.
