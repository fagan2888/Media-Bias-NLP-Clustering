Sioux Falls, SD

Hundreds of people walked along the streets of Downtown Sioux Falls admiring and buying art Saturday to celebrate the 52nd annual Sidewalk Arts Festival.

From music to arts and crafts and even face painting, there was something for the whole family in downtown Sioux Falls Saturday.

The annual Sidewalk Arts Festival adds a new splash of color this year with 75 new artist to display their creativity.

"It's all kinds of art. It's folk art, crafts, fine art, photography, ceramics. If you can think of it, I'm pretty sure it's here," Michele Wellman of the Washington Pavilion said.



Over 250 vendors were in downtown Sioux Falls showing off their arts and crafts. The catch? Everything they make has to be made by hand.

Artist are restricted from buying and selling products. Some people who came today say they're amazed by the variety of art.

"Oh I love it. I love all the neat stuff that people can make and I really enjoy looking at it," one passerby said.

Mud-Hen artist Mary Cameron makes leaf sculptures out of crumbled leaves and cement. She says arts and crafts has been a part of her life since she was a young girl.

"I was inspired actually by my father who did a lot of cement work growing up. The leftover cement I would make things out of and he called me mud-hen, hence the name," Cameron said.

Cameron says her sculptures have been a popular sale. She's just glad people admire her work just as much as she enjoys making it.

The vendors may be gone but the benefits of the event continue here in KELOLAND. The money raised goes to the Washington Pavilion's Visual arts Center. The funds raised will be used to bring musical artists to the premiere exhibitions.
