Every so often, though, there is a significant revelation in the paperwork. This year, one of the most important revelations came from Microsoft\u2019s filings, which spotlighted how the tax code allows corporations to enjoy the benefits of American citizenship yet avoid paying U.S. taxes.\n\nAccording to the SEC documents, the company is sitting on almost $29.6 billion it would owe in U.S. taxes if it repatriated the $92.9 billion of earnings it is keeping offshore. That amount of money represents a significant spike from prior years.\n\nTo put this in perspective, the levies the company would owe amount to almost the entire two-year operating budget of the company\u2019s home state of Washington.\n\nThe disclosure in Microsoft\u2019s SEC filing lands amid an intensifying debate over the fairness of U.S.-based multinational corporations using offshore subsidiaries to avoid paying American taxes. Such maneuvers \u2014 although often legal \u2014 threaten to significantly reduce U.S. corporate tax receipts during an era marked by government budget deficits.\n\nMicrosoft has not formally declared itself a subsidiary of a foreign company, so the firm has not technically engaged in the so-called \u201cinversion\u201d scheme that President Obama and Democrats have lately been criticizing. However, according to a 2012 U.S. Senate investigation, the company has in recent years used its offshore subsidiaries to substantially reduce its tax bills.\n\nThat probe uncovered details of how those subsidiaries are used. In its report, the Senate\u2019s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations noted that \u201cdespite the [company\u2019s] research largely occurring in the United States and generating U.S. tax credits, profit rights to the intellectual property are largely located in foreign tax havens.\u201d The report discovered that through those tax havens, \u201cMicrosoft was able to shift offshore nearly $21 billion (in a 3-year period), or almost half of its U.S. retail sales net revenue, saving up to $4.5 billion in taxes on goods sold in the United States, or just over $4 million in U.S. taxes each day.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft, of course, is not alone. According to a report by Citizens for Tax Justice, \u201cAmerican Fortune 500 corporations are likely saving about $550 billion by holding nearly $2 trillion of \u2018permanently reinvested\u2019 profits offshore.\u201d The report also found that \u201c28 corporations reveal that they have paid an income tax rate of 10 percent or less to the governments of the countries where these profits are officially held, indicating that most of these profits are likely in offshore tax havens.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "More and more companies who enjoy huge benefits operating in the U.S. are trying to weasel their way out of taxes", "title": "Microsoft\u2019s $29.6 billion scam: Tech giant leads the way in tax-avoiding innovation", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "More and more companies who enjoy huge benefits operating in the U.S. are trying to weasel their way out of taxes", "title": "Microsoft\u2019s $29.6 billion scam: Tech giant leads the way in tax-avoiding innovation", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/28/microsofts_29_6_billion_scam_tech_giant_leads_the_way_in_tax_avoiding_innovation/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/shutterstock_171257759.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "More and more companies who enjoy huge benefits operating in the U.S. are trying to weasel their way out of taxes", "title": "Microsoft\u2019s $29.6 billion scam: Tech giant leads the way in tax-avoiding innovation", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/shutterstock_171257759.jpg", "creator": "@@davidsirota", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David Sirota", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Microsoft, tax avoidance, Tax inversion, Taxes", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The disclosure in Microsoft\u2019s SEC filing lands amid an intensifying debate over the fairness of U.S.-based multinational corporations using offshore subsidiaries to avoid paying American taxes.\nTopics: Microsoft, tax avoidance, Tax inversion, Taxes, Innovation News, Technology News, News, Politics NewsReading companies\u2019 annual reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission is a reliable cure for insomnia.\nHowever, according to a 2012 U.S. Senate investigation, the company has in recent years used its offshore subsidiaries to substantially reduce its tax bills.\nAccording to the SEC documents, the company is sitting on almost $29.6 billion it would owe in U.S. taxes if it repatriated the $92.9 billion of earnings it is keeping offshore.\nSuch maneuvers \u2014 although often legal \u2014 threaten to significantly reduce U.S. corporate tax receipts during an era marked by government budget deficits."}
