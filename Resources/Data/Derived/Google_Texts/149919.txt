The T.H. Davis Aviation Center at GTCC is located at 260 Regional Road in Greensboro‬. On Feb. 21, 2013 officials with Guilford Technical Community held a groundbreaking for the future GTCC Aviation Building III. The new 41,000-square-foot-facility will accommodate the aviation program's growing enrollment and allow for additional programs.

Among the few consistent bright spots in the Triad economy has been the aviation industry.

From big players such as Timco and Honda Aircraft Company, to smaller parts makers such as Machine Specialties and Purolator Facets, aviation continues to add well-paying jobs to the local economy. Growing along with the industry has been Guilford Technical Community College (GTCC), whose training programs fuel the local job growth in aviation.

In this week’s cover story in the Triad Business Journal, reporter Katie Arcieri looks at the training offered at GTCC’s Davis Aviation Center near the Piedmont Triad International Airport, and how those programs are expanding.
