Butler County has had to spend almost $500,000 a year to hire extra staff to handle Medicaid expansion. GREG LYNCH / STAFF\n\nBy Denise G. Callahan\n\nStaff Writer\n\nMedicaid expansion has cost almost $500,000 annually on labor costs in Butler County since it was expanded in 2014, causing some officials to say it is yet another unfunded mandate.\n\nCommissioner T.C. Rogers recalls that when he first came on the commission he attended a retreat where state officials said Medicaid expansion would be budget neutral at the local level.\n\n\u201cI was told maybe one, maybe one-and-a-half,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cBased on my math it\u2019s more like six\u2026 I\u2019ve got a problem with when you say you have to take the people in and if you\u2019re saying there is not going to be a cost, and there is, then that\u2019s an unfunded mandate. So just tell it like it is.\u201d\n\nRogers said he understands the state pays for Medicaid workers now, but he worries if that might change, hence he has dubbed it an unfunded mandate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been my experience where it\u2019s a state cost and they cut it and now it\u2019s a county cost,\u201d Rogers said.\n\nRay Pater, executive director of the county\u2019s Job and Family Services agency figured it has cost $440,000 per year to pay eight new employees\u2019 salaries and benefits. The number of Medicaid recipients jumped more than 20 percent or 14,069 people in 2014 to 81,521 and today stands at 86,909.\n\nMedicaid records show there were 64,445 recipients in the county in March 2013 before the expansion was pushed through by Gov. John Kasich and $41.4 million was spent and $55.6 million was spent in March of this year on 86,263 people.\n\nOver the past two years, more than 600,000 Ohioans have signed up for Medicaid under expanded eligibility requirements that allow most able bodied adults with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 or $27,724 for a family of three in 2015 \u2014 to obtain coverage.\n\nThe county doesn\u2019t pay the Medicaid costs but Pater said \u201cabsolutely\u201d it was an unfunded mandate that impacted his whole operation.\n\n\u201cWith the expansion and with all the additional changes coming July 1st there\u2019s a lot that goes into the processing of these cases,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re still fighting the whole food stamp timeliness and trying to have the best customer service we can on the phones and in the lobby. If we didn\u2019t have to put the resources to this we could absolutely then put them to the other areas and be more effective and efficient.\u201d\n\nScott Rasmus, executive director for the Butler County Mental Health and Addiction Recovery Services Board, said there used to be a local match for Medicaid which stood at 60/40 with the federal government picking up the lion\u2019s share prior to the Great Recession. It gradually it moved to 80/20 and now the federal government is footing the whole bill through the end of this year. Beginning next year states will begin chipping in, up to 10 percent by 2020.\n\nMedicaid expansion has had a positive impact on the MHARS board.\n\n\u201cWhat the local board may have used as subsidy dollars, that\u2019s local taxpayer dollars and some state dollars, now Medicaid covers,\u201d Rasmus said adding things like assessments, case management, counseling, psychiatric evaluations and treatment and intensive outpatient for substance abuse. \u201cIt has freed up some funds.\u201d\n\nAs a result of President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act (ACA) every state was initially mandated to expand Medicaid. A U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2012 made it optional. There are 26 states that have adopted the expansion and while Kasich did not support ACA he pushed hard for expansion here.\n\n\u201cSome of the poorest Ohioans, they get their primary care in an emergency room,\u201d Kasich said at the time. \u201cWhen they go visit these emergency rooms and cannot pay, we all pay for it.\u201d\n\nKasich did kind of an end around the legislature \u2014 where expansion was not popular with peers on Republican side \u2014 and lobbied the state\u2019s Controlling Board to get it approved.\n\nKimball Strickland, CEO of Butler Behavioral Health, said in addition to freeing up local dollars for things that aren\u2019t covered by Medicaid, like residential services, vocational services and social services, it opened up services to many people who previously had no access.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t deny that it really brought a lot of people to services that weren\u2019t there before,\u201d he said. \u201cParticularly I have found it to be true in the alcohol and drug area.\u201d\n\nChuck Demidovich, who runs the county Care Facility, said the biggest change he has seen is a larger number of younger, chronically ill people. While he understands concerns for budgets he said there are needs being met now that have been sorely lacking.\n\n\u201cExpansion for, what it\u2019s done for us, and people won\u2019t want to hear this, but the expansion of Medicaid has allowed people with drug addiction issues and health care issues to be given care,\u201d he said. \u201cAddiction is a disease and those are the clients we are seeing. In the past they would have been indigent people in the emergency rooms.\u201d\n\nHospitals favored expansion, for the very reason Demidovich mentioned, but Elizabeth Long, spokesperson Fort Hamilton Hospital, said Medicaid expansion hasn\u2019t been a complete panacea.\n\n\u201cAlthough Medicaid expansion has helped us and reduced our uncompensated care,\u201d she said. \u201cMedicaid reimbursements are below our costs to provide services.\u201d\n\nMedicaid expansion isn\u2019t the only thing having an impact on county JFS agencies either, there are more changes, possibly a requirement that some Medicaid recipients pay a portion of their health care. Joel Potts, executive director of the Ohio Job and Family Services Directors\u2019 Association, said they are also immersed in building a new computer system, the marriage of food stamps and Ohio Means Jobs and more are looming.\n\n\u201cEven if we didn\u2019t do Medicaid expansion, our counties would be drowning,\u201d he said. \u201cCounties have been doing overtime for the past two years, struggling with training, getting everything in, hiring staff, doing what they need to do to get this new system going, then you add Medicaid expansion, which is the largest. growth of a health and human service program in the state of Ohio.\u201d\n\nJohn McCarthy, director of the Ohio Department of Medicaid said there actually might be some relief coming if they get federal approval to require recipients to help pay for their own health care, because the health savings account contribution might exceed the services they have been receiving.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s about 260,000 people in that situation, so we assume that fifty percent of those people, while they\u2019re still eligible for Medicaid will choose not to enroll because they are making that economic decision,\u201d he said. \u201cSo Medicaid enrollment will go down to about 130,000 people a year.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Medicaid expansion has cost almost $500,000 annually on labor costs in Butler County since it was expanded in 2014, causing some officials to say it is yet another unfunded mandate.", "og": {"url": "http://www.journal-news.com/news/news/local-govt-politics/medicaid-expansion-has-been-costly-for-butler-coun/nrJhS/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2016/05/07/a8/c9/050816-medicaid2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Medicaid expansion has cost almost $500,000 annually on labor costs in Butler County since it was expanded in 2014, causing some officials to say it is yet another unfunded mandate.", "title": "Medicaid expansion has been costly for Butler County"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2016/05/07/a8/c9/050816-medicaid2.jpg", "description": "Medicaid expansion has cost almost $500,000 annually on labor costs in Butler County since it was expanded in 2014, causing some officials to say it is yet another unfunded mandate.", "site": "@journalnews", "card": "summary", "title": "Medicaid expansion has been costly for Butler County"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "journal-news", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.journal-news.com/news/news/local-govt-politics/medicaid-expansion-has-been-costly-for-butler-coun/nrJhS/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/3336779/news/news/local-govt-politics/medicaid-expansion-has-been-costly-for-butler-coun/nrJhS/", "keywords": "Butler County,HJNhomepage", "google-site-verification": "4Q9_13tOch6eLcVYCHatUepAlnmJQbgHMCB16qdjcy0", "news_keywords": "Butler County, HJNhomepage"}, "article_summary": "Butler County has had to spend almost $500,000 a year to hire extra staff to handle Medicaid expansion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been my experience where it\u2019s a state cost and they cut it and now it\u2019s a county cost,\u201d Rogers said.\n\u201cEven if we didn\u2019t do Medicaid expansion, our counties would be drowning,\u201d he said.\nMedicaid expansion has had a positive impact on the MHARS board.\nMedicaid records show there were 64,445 recipients in the county in March 2013 before the expansion was pushed through by Gov."}
