Substitute teachers in North Carolina are having their hours cut so the school district won’t have to pay for their health insurance under Obamacare, WITN-NC reports.

One district in Pitt County told a WITN reporter that they’d informed substitute teachers they could only work 12 days a month or 90 hours a month. It was not a decision they wanted to make, but the Obamacare mandate forced their hand.

The government is literally taking people out of work, said David Perry, a substitute teacher.

“I felt like they were telling me I couldn’t work when I wanted to work,” Perry said. “Who has a right to tell me I can’t work if a job is available? I was shocked.”

According to the new federal law, if an employee works more than 30 hours a week, they must receive health benefits from their employer. To supply every substitute with health care would cost Pitt County upwards of $7 million.
