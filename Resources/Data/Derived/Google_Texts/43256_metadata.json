The funds are designated for expanding the company\u2019s geographic and operational reach among Medicaid expansion states, and for efforts to identify and enroll 2 million Medicaid eligible employees whom would otherwise unlikely claim this essential benefit. This brings BeneStream\u2019s total funding to date to over $3 million.\n\n\u201cThis new round of funding from the Ford Foundation will help us fuel the company\u2019s already explosive growth which is being driven by the Employer Mandate,\u201d said Ben Geyerhahn, CEO and Founder of BeneStream. \u201cWe anticipate that this financing will help us to expand our dominant market position and our profitability.\u201d\n\nPrior to implementation of the ACA, the working poor was the largest uninsured demographic because most of the time their employers did not offer health benefits, and prior to the expansion they didn\u2019t qualify for Medicaid. Medicaid was expanded based on the knowledge that this demographic wouldn\u2019t be able to afford any additional cost that would result from passage of the ACA.\n\nBeneStream has been contracted to work with tens of thousands of workers across the country in Medicaid Expansion states, with a target for screening upwards of 10-15,000 people per month in the 2015 calendar year.\n\n\u201cThis is a great opportunity for low-income workers to receive the health security they deserve,\u201d said Helen Neuborne, Director of Quality Employment at the Ford Foundation. \u201cMedicaid Expansion clearly goes hand-in-hand with the ACA. This investment is to ensure that as broad a range of Medicaid-eligible individuals as possible are able to receive the appropriate health care coverage.\u201d\n\nHistorically, those in need of and entitled to public benefits have let them go unclaimed at a rate of billions of dollars per year for a host of reasons including difficulty in applying and the time commitment the process requires. The Ford Foundation already supports nonprofits working to address this issue across the country.\n\nBeneStream complements these existing programs and vastly expands the possibility for their reach based on its model of working through employers via a paid service. Millions of workers from a demographic that is typically hard to locate and engage via traditional means can now access benefits more easily from their place of work. Whereas nonprofits have been limited by the size of their funding, BeneStream\u2019s reach is only limited by the number of employers who use the service. In addition, the data generated by BeneStream will be further used to help participating employees apply for other benefits like SNAP, Lifeline phones, and more as the program is brought to scale.\n\nBeneStream\u2019s Board of Advisors is a who\u2019s-who of the labor, tech investment, health insurance, and health tech sectors: Andy Stern, Esther Dyson, Kevin Hill, formerly of Oxford Health, Martin Babinec who founded TriNet, and Ashok Subramanian, CEO and Co-founder of Liazon, among others. A complete list of BeneStream\u2019s board can be found at http://benestream.com/about/.\n\nABOUT BENESTREAM\n\nBeneStream provides the only alternative solution for employers to satisfy the Employee Mandate portion of the Affordable Care Act by handling the enrollment of qualifying employees in Medicaid, rather than private insurance. Medicaid enrollment is a personal benefit that companies do not typically endeavor to handle for their staff. BeneStream was founded by Benjamin Geyerhahn, a healthcare policy expert and member of New York Governor Cuomo\u2019s Health Benefit Exchange Regional Advisory Committee. The company employs a combination of screening and monitoring software and a multilingual call center.", "article_metadata": {"description": "BeneStream announced a $1.5 mm program-related investment from the Ford Foundation to expand efforts to identify and enroll 2 mm Medicaid eligible emp", "og": {"image": {"width": 465, "identifier": "http://www.businesswire.com/images/bwlogo_square.png", "type": "image/png", "height": 225}}, "twitter": {"description": "BeneStream announced a $1.5 mm program-related investment from the Ford Foundation to expand efforts to identify and enroll 2 mm Medicaid eligible emp", "title": "BeneStream Receives $1.5 Million in Financing from Ford Foundation to Expand Operations and Enroll More Low-Income Americans into Medicaid", "image": {"src": "http://mms.businesswire.com/media/20141124005703/en/442817/21/Screen_Shot_2014-11-11_at_11.56.38_AM.jpg"}, "site": "@businesswire", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "DC.date.issued": "2014-11-24", "p": {"domain_verify": "95725e0359a14c2e1ccbd936e10d20d6"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb463\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis new round of funding from the Ford Foundation will help us fuel the company\u2019s already explosive growth which is being driven by the Employer Mandate,\u201d said Ben Geyerhahn, CEO and Founder of BeneStream.\nThe funds are designated for expanding the company\u2019s geographic and operational reach among Medicaid expansion states, and for efforts to identify and enroll 2 million Medicaid eligible employees whom would otherwise unlikely claim this essential benefit.\nThe Ford Foundation already supports nonprofits working to address this issue across the country.\n\u201cMedicaid Expansion clearly goes hand-in-hand with the ACA.\n\u201cThis is a great opportunity for low-income workers to receive the health security they deserve,\u201d said Helen Neuborne, Director of Quality Employment at the Ford Foundation."}
