Students spent another $118.6 million\n\non living expenses in the Boulder, Denver and Fort Collins-Loveland areas.\n\nWhile the big spending was a key finding of the joint report by Brookings and JPMorgan Chase, the report also suggested regional leaders can better capitalize on the students\u2019 connections to fast-growing foreign markets to increase local jobs and investment.\n\nAbout two-thirds of foreign students major in science, technology, engineering, math or business and could be recruited to close critical employment gaps through the F-1 visa\u2019s optional practice training program, report author Neil Ruiz said in an interview. OPT allows the students to work 12 to 29 months in the U.S. after they graduate.\n\n\u201cIf a metro area has a shortage, or needs workers, why not hire ones that are located locally,\u201d Ruiz said.\n\nForeign students also offer valuable knowledge of the business, cultural and societal norms of countries of origin and so can serve as a bridge to global economies, he said.\n\nForeign students in 118 markets across the U.S. spent $21.8 billion on tuition and $12.8 billion on living costs. However, just 45 percent of these students extended their visas and got jobs after graduation.\n\nIn metro Denver, where 6,360 students attended the University of Denver, University of Colorado Denver, Colorado School of Mines, Colorado Heights College and Colorado Technical University, 56.5 percent extended their visas.\n\nAmong the 2,442 international students who attended CU, Naropa University and Southwest Acupuncture College in Boulder, just 30.9 percent of the graduates stayed under OPT, compared with 34.4 percent of the 1,856 students from Colorado State University and Front Range Community College in Fort Collins.\n\nThe F-1 visa application requires students to express their intent to return to their home countries, CU-Boulder international program director Larry Bell said. \u201cBut many of them have a short-term goal of gaining work experience before they return home.\u201d\n\nSome, he said, stay on beyond the OPT program on temporary employment visas and later seek permanent residency.\n\n\u201cThere is a bit of money to be made here and many of them continue on in the U.S.,\u201d Bell said. \u201cThey are in high-skill fields, like engineering and other STEM disciplines.\u201d\n\nThere were 1,879 international students at CU-Boulder last year. Bell expects about 2,000 this year and said the university hopes about 10 percent of its 30,000-student enrollment will be international in the next five years.\n\nAt DU, there were 1,417 international students last year and an additional 200 in the OPT program. About 40 percent were business majors, international program director David Gowdey said.\n\n\u201cThey constitute almost 12 percent of our total enrollment,\u201d Gowdey said. \u201cAnd they tend to pay full tuition, so they have a pretty substantial economic impact.\u201d\n\nBut beyond the hard dollars, the international students provide a global context on campus where some students haven\u2019t experienced cultures different than their own, he said. This helps DU students emerge better prepared for work worldwide.\n\nAnd there is an added bonus, when students return home and wind up in positions of great influence, Gowdey said. DU\n\nhas graduated people who now are foreign ministers of Iran and Chile, and leaders of major corporations, including Emirates Airlines.\n\n\u201cFrom the United States perspective, having an official that senior who has a fond memory of Denver can only be good for the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nHoward Pankratz: 303-954-1939, hpankratz@denverpost.com or twitter.com/howardpankratz", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Report: Foreign students had $371.3M impact on Colorado in 2008-12", "title": "Report: Foreign students had $371.3M impact on Colorado in 2008-12", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/29/report-foreign-students-had-371-3m-impact-on-colorado-in-2008-12/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140830__globalchartp1.jpg", "height": 444}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140830__globalchartp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-29T16:48:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T12:20:05+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0caa\"", "article_summary": "In metro Denver, where 6,360 students attended the University of Denver, University of Colorado Denver, Colorado School of Mines, Colorado Heights College and Colorado Technical University, 56.5 percent extended their visas.\nForeign students on F-1 visas spent $371.3 million to study and live in Colorado during the five-year period.\n\u201cThey are in high-skill fields, like engineering and other STEM disciplines.\u201dThere were 1,879 international students at CU-Boulder last year.\nStudents spent another $118.6 millionon living expenses in the Boulder, Denver and Fort Collins-Loveland areas.\nAt DU, there were 1,417 international students last year and an additional 200 in the OPT program."}
