He brings the skills and tenacity of an investigative reporter to his coverage of organized labor and management in America and pulls no punches, no matter who he\u2019s writing about.\n\nMoyers & Company\u2019s Michael Winship, who\u2019s also president of the Writers Guild of America, East, an AFL-CIO affiliated union, gave Elk a call to check in as he crossed the country with the Summer of Solidarity Tour. It\u2019s a road trip leading up to Labor Day organized by what Elk calls \u201crank-and-file union activists\u201d and aimed at bringing public attention to economic justice issues as well as strengthening ties between community activists and grassroots labor organizers. The two discuss the tour, interesting trends in organized labor and the decline of labor reporting. Elk also gives his thoughts on how we might celebrate Labor Day to best honor those who originally fought for the right to organize and better working conditions.\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nMichael Winship: So where are you right now?\n\nMike Elk: I\u2019m in Madison, Wisc.\n\nWinship: And what\u2019s going on there?\n\nElk: I\u2019m on this Summer of Solidarity Tour. It\u2019s a group of grassroots rank and file union activists that are going cross country organizing events focused at bringing rank and file members closer together from different places and interacting and getting a sense of what are the struggles in other places and how folks can connect them.\n\nWinship: How did this come about?\n\nElk: It came about from some Honeywell workers who two years ago were locked out of their plant, and they started going on road trips to visit other locals, and they realized a lot of knowledge that was gained by visiting people from other areas. Because I think what so often happens, not just in labor struggles, but for workers in general, is that folks feel isolated, and they feel like they\u2019re the only people out there fighting, and I think when folks get on the road and visit other people fighting they get a sense that it\u2019s a much larger plight and I think it gives them a sense that they should stick in and fight it out. You know, I think so many workers in the workplace don\u2019t resist much because they feel like they\u2019re all alone, like they\u2019re all isolated, and don\u2019t realize that there other ways of doing things. I think that\u2019s what the tour\u2019s really about is about bringing people together in that sense.\n\nWinship: I think a lot of our readers may not be familiar with the Honeywell situation. Can you give some background? I know you\u2019ve been working on a book about it.\n\nElk: Basically, in 2010, a lot of uranium workers at Honeywell\u2019s Metropolis, Illinois, facility were locked out from their job for 14 months. It was a lockout that really drew some questions to the White House about which side they\u2019re on. David Cote, CEO of Honeywell, is considered Obama\u2019s closest ally in the business community. When Obama introduced the stimulus in January 2009, Cote gave a speech. Obama appointed Cote to the deficit commission, where he\u2019s called for things like cutting social security and implementing chained CPI. During the lockout, Obama flew on Air Force One with Cote to India as part of an official state visit. Last year, I obtained internal confidential Honeywell documents stating that Honeywell\u2019s relationship with the Obama Administration was crucial to breaking up union cohesion across the country. And what we\u2019ve seen across the country are a number of lockouts and labor struggles at Honeywell plants across the country, at defense contractors and other federally regulated facilities, where the federal government could step in to stop the lockouts but don\u2019t. Indeed, by not stepping in, they\u2019re giving aid to them.\n\nSo it\u2019s really a larger metaphor, the Honeywell struggle, for what\u2019s happened with this administration not sort of showing what side they\u2019re on when it comes to workplace struggles.\n\nThe lockout at Honeywell ended in 2011, but after it ended there were a number of firings of top union leaders in the plant. They shut down the plant to fix some safety problems, and now the plant is restarting, but they don\u2019t want to hire back the union president, as well as a number of other folks. So the plant is understaffed and they\u2019re demanding people work overtime. And currently, the union is refusing to work overtime, so in response, Honeywell has cancelled summer vacations for all of its 400 or so employees in its Metropolis uranium plant in order to punish the workers for refusing to work overtime.\n\nWinship: So where have you been on this tour so far?\n\nElk: I\u2019ve been in Pittsburgh, visited a number of local activists. I\u2019ve been in Detroit, where they rallied with public workers fighting the Detroit bankruptcy and the threat that might cause to public pensions in Detroit. I was in Chicago, where they rallied with striking Rotek workers. I was here in Madison, Wisc., yesterday, where the workers rallied with people singing in the state capital, in order to fight the ban that Governor Walker has put on groups of more than 20 singing in the state capital.\n\nWinship: And where else are you going?\n\nElk: We\u2019re going to Fargo, North Dakota, and then over to Missoula, Montana, then to Portland, Oregon, and then down to San Francisco. And I\u2019m getting off there. The tour\u2019s continuing on to Los Angeles.\n\nWinship: So what are the things that have impressed you most on the tour?\n\nElk: I think what really impressed me most was seeing the city of Detroit. I grew up in Pittsburgh, where there were a lot of mills that were closed, and I was used to seeing a lot of mills and sort of rundown neighborhoods, but nothing on the scale of Detroit, the level of bombed-out neighborhoods that just look simply abandoned. And the incredible thing about Detroit is, while it\u2019s bombed out, when you drive around you get the sense that this was once an incredible city. I mean it was once the fourth largest city in America. And it just really blew my mind seeing Detroit like that.\n\nAnd it\u2019s also fun any time you get out of D.C. I mean the thing about D.C. you notice when you go to other places in the U.S. is that people in D.C. are very insecure. There\u2019s a constant sense of people trying to move up the political food chain ladder, young staffers trying to move up the political food chain ladder. And when you get out of D.C., as you start interacting with real folks, you get the sense that there\u2019s a lot more to this country than the sort of insecurity that plagues so many people that work in our nation\u2019s capital.\n\nWinship: So how important do you think these grassroots efforts and other community efforts are to revitalizing organized labor?\n\nElk: I see in a lot of labor organizations a lot of bureaucracy, and all you see is staff representatives interacting with workers from one location, and you don\u2019t see rank and file workers getting together from across locations and sharing ideas. And that\u2019s really what we\u2019re going to need because, as anybody who\u2019s spent a lot of time around union bureaucracies knows, they can very quickly become intellectually stagnant, they can very quickly become places where people are just going through the motions, whereas rank-and-file workers have much more at stake since it\u2019s literally their jobs. I mean if workers get their pay cut, that doesn\u2019t mean that union staffers\u2019 salaries go down. So I think rank-and-file workers really need to be back in the driver\u2019s seat, and I think maybe this tour could be part of that sort of process of many workers who wish they were more back in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\nWinship: AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka has been talking about bringing non-union groups like the Sierra Club into the AFL. What do you think about that?\n\nElk: Well, I think it\u2019s a rather complicated situation. To begin with, you\u2019re going to have groups affiliated in some manner with the AFL-CIO, so what kind of decision-making power does that mean? Does that mean they get invited to some meetings and they get a say? Does that mean they get voting power? I don\u2019t think it means they get voting power within the AFL-CIO, because of the constitution of the AFL-CIO. I do, however, think that there might be some sort of political organization that everybody contributes money to that they do get some kind of power, and I think it means closer coordination.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Labor journalist Mike Elk on the fast-food worker strikes -- and how we should best commemorate Labor Day VIDEO", "title": "Senseless bureaucracy is killing organized labor", "og": {"url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/02/labor_journalist_mike_elk_i_dont_know_if_im_optimistic_about_the_future_of_labor_partner/", "site_name": "Salon", "type": "article", "description": "Labor journalist Mike Elk on the fast-food worker strikes -- and how we should best commemorate Labor Day VIDEO", "title": "Senseless bureaucracy is killing organized labor"}, "twitter": {"description": "Labor journalist Mike Elk on the fast-food worker strikes -- and how we should best commemorate Labor Day VIDEO", "title": "Senseless bureaucracy is killing organized labor", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@salon"}, "author": "Michael Winship", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Activism, AFL-CIO, Bill Moyers, Fast food workers strike, Labor, Labor Day, Unions, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Activism, AFL-CIO, Bill Moyers, Fast food workers strike, Labor, Labor Day, Unions, Video, Business News, Life News, Politics NewsThis piece originally appeared on BillMoyers.com.\nThe two discuss the tour, interesting trends in organized labor and the decline of labor reporting.\nWinship: So how important do you think these grassroots efforts and other community efforts are to revitalizing organized labor?\nI mean if workers get their pay cut, that doesn\u2019t mean that union staffers\u2019 salaries go down.\nHe brings the skills and tenacity of an investigative reporter to his coverage of organized labor and management in America and pulls no punches, no matter who he\u2019s writing about."}
