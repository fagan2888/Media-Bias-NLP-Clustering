And on the third step God says to me, \u2018I\u2019m using you. I want to see how you respond. But most importantly I want them to see how you respond.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe football star paused while the audience clapped, recounted the team\u2019s win the previous week against the Green Bay Packers, and then said that without obstacles people would not need to turn to Christ.\n\n\u201cOver the past five months or six months or whatever I\u2019ve been able to see how God has been using me.
