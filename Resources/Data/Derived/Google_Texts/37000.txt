WASHINGTON (AP) - The National Children’s Museum will close its location at National Harbor in Maryland this weekend and will temporarily relocate some exhibits to District of Columbia public libraries.

Museum officials say the National Harbor location will close Sunday. The new “Exhibits on Loan” program will open in several D.C. libraries in early 2015.

The collaboration with libraries will give the museum space to present educational programs while it looks for a new home. The library exhibits will be designed for children age 8 and younger.

The museum announced last month that it plans to move back to the District after two years in Maryland. The museum wants to increase its program space and accessibility by public transportation. Museum officials have issued a request for proposals to developers and real estate brokers.
