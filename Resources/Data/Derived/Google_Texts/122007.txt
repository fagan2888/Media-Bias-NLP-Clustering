GOP presidential hopeful Ted Cruz is building his presidential campaign on fighting the entrenched interests of the Republican leadership in the Senate, and at the RedState Gathering on Saturday, he kicked it up a notch.

The colors of their team jerseys may be different, but at the Senate leadership level, Republicans are playing on the same team as the Democrats, he said.

And America is losing because of it.

As he has been before, Cruz was scathing about the performance of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, comparing it to his predecessor Democrat Leader Harry Reid of Nevada.

“Here’s the truth — Mitch McConnell and Harry Reid are arm-in-arm working together to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, and to continue the cronyism and corporate welfare — of Washington,” he said in reply to a question from the RedState audience in Atlanta.

“It’s not two parties, it is one party — the party of Washington, the McConnell-Reid leadership team” added the Texas Republican. “The problem is they are not listening to us. We need to change it.”

In a blistering 24-minute Senate floor speech on July 24, Cruz went to far as to call McConnell a liar.

Cruz accused McConnell of failing to fight for the issues that matter to conservatives.

“They’re not fighting to defund Planned Parenthood,” he said. “They’re not fighting to stop Obamacare. They’re certainly not fighting to stop executive amnesty or illegal immigration or past case law or end sanctuary cities.”

He concluded with how to go about getting rid of the “Party of Washington.”

“The way you change it is the grassroots holding all of us accountable,” he said.

The following clip is of Cruz’s question and answer session. This particular question starts at about the 3:15 mark.
