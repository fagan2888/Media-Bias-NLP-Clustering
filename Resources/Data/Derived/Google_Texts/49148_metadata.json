The 23 clubhouse workers, who provide services to team players such as cleaning and preparing the locker room for games, were paid $50 a day. But they worked as many as 11 hours on game days, and so were not properly paid the minimum wage and overtime, Surbey said.\n\nThe settlement with the Giants involves payment of $220,793 in back wages and damages to 78 employees. Most were interns who received stipends but were determined by the agency to have been employees entitled to minimum wage and overtime. The interns worked in baseball operations and group sales, among other duties, and were due back wages ranging from $60 to $4,000 apiece.\n\nA Giants spokeswoman declined comment, and representatives of the Marlins and the baseball commissioner\u2019s office did not return phone calls.\n\n\u201cWhether in America\u2019s factories, fields or ball parks, a fair day\u2019s work deserves a fair day\u2019s pay,\u201d said David Weil, administrator for the Wage and Hour Division. \u201cUnfortunately, in our recent investigations of Major League Baseball teams, we found employees not being paid the minimum wage and overtime to which they are legally entitled. That\u2019s unacceptable and I am pleased that we have been able to secure back wages for those workers.\u201d\n\nFederal officials would not provide details of the Orioles and A\u2019s cases, describing them as open investigations. Team representatives also declined to give details.\n\nWage settlements with the Miami Marlins and San Francisco Giants involve paying more than a half million dollars in back wages and damages to more than 100 employees.

An Orioles spokesman said the club is \u201caware of an ongoing investigation, but we don\u2019t have any comment at this time.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Baltimore Orioles and Oakland A's are the latest teams to come under scrutiny for possible wage violations", "title": "Federal probe into Major League Baseball for illegal pay practices expands", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The Baltimore Orioles and Oakland A's are the latest teams to come under scrutiny for possible wage violations", "title": "Federal probe into Major League Baseball for illegal pay practices expands", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/25/federal_probe_into_mlb_for_illegal_pay_practices_expands_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/AP909056967045-1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Baltimore Orioles and Oakland A's are the latest teams to come under scrutiny for possible wage violations", "title": "Federal probe into Major League Baseball for illegal pay practices expands", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/AP909056967045-1-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Myron Levin and Stuart Silverstein", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Baltimore Orioles, Baseball, FairWarning, MLB, Oakland A's, U.S. Department of Labor, wage violations", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd448\"", "article_summary": "\u201cUnfortunately, in our recent investigations of Major League Baseball teams, we found employees not being paid the minimum wage and overtime to which they are legally entitled.\nMost were interns who received stipends but were determined by the agency to have been employees entitled to minimum wage and overtime.\nBut they worked as many as 11 hours on game days, and so were not properly paid the minimum wage and overtime, Surbey said.\nA Giants spokeswoman declined comment, and representatives of the Marlins and the baseball commissioner\u2019s office did not return phone calls.\nAccording to agency spokesman Jason Surbey, the Marlins agreed to pay $288,290 in back wages and damages to 39 team employees, including clubhouse and office staff."}
