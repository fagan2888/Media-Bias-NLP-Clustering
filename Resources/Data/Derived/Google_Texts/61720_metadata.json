According to a new study, middle-aged people with a body mass index (BMI) in the category of slightly overweight had higher chances of living longer than any other weight category.\n\nBMI is a calculation of weight and height meant to measure for obesity. It\u2019s used throughout health care facilities in the U.S. as a way of predicting any obesity-related health risks, however, some believe it should be replaced with measures that factor weight in relation to muscle content. That\u2019s because having some weight has been shown to be beneficial to a person\u2019s health. Specifically, among those who are sick, a little extra fat may hold the necessary energy that person needs to overcome their illness. The researchers also found that those who were underweight with the same condition were four times more likely to die.\n\nThese reasons could also explain why slightly overweight people (BMI of 25-29.9), aged 51 to 61, had the highest rate of survival over the course of 16 years, researchers said. This group was followed closely by those who moved from slightly overweight to obese (BMI of 30 to 34.9), which was then followed by those who were of a normal weight (BMI 18.5 to 24.9), those who were obese, those of normal weight who lost more weight, and finally, those who were overly obese (BMI of 35 and up). In fact, only 7.2 percent of deaths were due to weight gain among obese people.\n\n\u201cThis suggests that among overweight people at age 51, small weight gains do not significantly lower the probability of survival,\u201d Hui Zheng, lead author of the study and assistant professor of sociology at The Ohio State University, said in a statement.\n\nThe researchers looked at data from the Health and Retirement Study, which surveyed Americans born between 1931 and 1941. The study included 9,538 participants who were surveyed in 1992, and then interviewed them again every two years afterward, until 2008. Zheng and his team looked at information regarding BMI changes among the participants, and at whether or not they died before Dec. 2009.\n\nThe results held even after accounting for smoking and chronic illnesses, Zheng said. \u201cA small amount of extra weight may provide protection against nutritional and energy deficiencies, metabolic stresses, the development of wasting and frailty, and loss of muscle and bone density caused by chronic diseases.\u201d\n\nBut although it may help older people, it\u2019s not safe for younger people to pack on the pounds, he warned. One reason: they just don\u2019t get sick as often. Still, he emphasized that the main finding from this study was that any weight gain isn\u2019t good.\n\nAccording to the CDC, over a third of American adults are overweight, putting them at the most risk for obesity-related diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and some kinds of cancer.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "body,mass,index,weight,fat,overweight,death,energy,obesity,health,illness,sickness,", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A little bit of body fat may be the key to helping older people live longer, according to a new study, which found that slightly overweight people were more likely to survive over the course of 16 years than any other group.", "title": "Body Fat May Help Older, Slightly Overweight People Live Longer", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/body-fat-may-help-older-slightly-overweight-people-live-longer-other-weight-groups-257378", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/19/obesity.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A little bit of body fat may be the key to helping older people live longer, according to a new study, which found that slightly overweight people were more likely to survive over the course of 16 years than any other group.", "title": "Body Fat May Help Older, Slightly Overweight People Live Longer", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/body-fat-may-help-older-slightly-overweight-people-live-longer-other-weight-groups-257378", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/19/obesity.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/19/obesity.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-09-19T22:00:56-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-19T22:03:26-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A little bit of body fat may be the key to helping older people live longer, according to a new study, which found that slightly overweight people were more likely to survive over the course of 16 years than any other group."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce6b4\"", "article_summary": "According to a new study, middle-aged people with a body mass index (BMI) in the category of slightly overweight had higher chances of living longer than any other weight category.\nThese reasons could also explain why slightly overweight people (BMI of 25-29.9), aged 51 to 61, had the highest rate of survival over the course of 16 years, researchers said.\nStill, he emphasized that the main finding from this study was that any weight gain isn\u2019t good.\nThe researchers looked at data from the Health and Retirement Study, which surveyed Americans born between 1931 and 1941.\nBMI is a calculation of weight and height meant to measure for obesity."}
