Thirty-seven percent of alumni said the experience was \u201cwell worth it.\u201d\n\nCount Tampa student Niulca Tavarez among the latter group.\n\nShe's studying clinical mental health counseling at Argosy University in Tampa and says she's \u201c100 percent convinced\u201d her education will pay off in the future. \u201cIf not, I wouldn't keep coming here,\u201d Tavarez said.\n\nThe Public Agenda report, \u201cProfiting Higher Education? What Students, Alumni and Employers Think About For-Profit Colleges,\u201d reflected the mixed results on perception of college impact and suggested that students at for-profits were largely uninformed about their schools and hadn't taken advantage of data available to them when they picked an institution.\n\nThe situation is significant because for-profit colleges such as the University of Phoenix, DeVry University and ITT Technical Institute have seen major increases in enrollment, from about 4.7 percent of all U.S. undergraduate enrollment in the 2001-02 academic year to 13.3 percent in 2011-12, the latest figures available.\n\nAnd according to Carolin Hagelskamp, Public Agenda's director of research and the report's lead author, an uninformed student is a disadvantaged student.\n\n\u201cWe saw that prospective students don't really think about things like average graduation rate, dropout rate, what the typical graduate earns, the salaries and positions they get,\u201d Hagelskamp said. \u201cThese are key educational statistics that the federal government is collecting and spending a lot of money and effort to make available to the public so they can make informed decisions.\u201d\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nThe report said just 4 in 10 students at for-profits considered another school before they decided to enroll.\n\nThe report also cited what its authors called the \u201cstartling lack of awareness\u201d among students about the overall concept of for-profit colleges. Sixty-five percent of current for-profit students and 63 percent of alumni were unsure whether their school was a for-profit or not.\n\nNoah Black, a spokesman for the Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities, said the survey results reflect changes in higher education. \u201cI wouldn't draw the conclusion that students are uninformed about what they're doing, they're just informing themselves about different things,\u201d he said.\n\nBlack citied the traditional scenario of a potential college student sitting down at the dinner table with his or her parents, poring through college catalogs and reaching a decision on the student's future. Today, he said, that scenario might involve a single parent raising a 5-year-old and considering a college, wondering where to find the flexibility needed to go to school and take care of children.\n\n\u201cWe do a lot of things differently today than we did 20 years ago,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the survey, for-profit schools received impressive marks when it came to the nuts and bolts of higher education.\n\nNinety-one percent of current undergraduates said they received effective guidance so they could stay on track; 87 percent said they had instructors who cared about their students and knew how to teach; 85 percent said their school provided good opportunities to work in teams; 85 percent said class sizes were kept small; and 83 percent said there was hands-on help with financial aid applications.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nThe report said prospective students looking at a for-profit college say qualities like online learning, accelerated programs and hands-on support are key considerations.\n\n\u201cAs this report details, private-sector institutions are being responsive to today's students in ways that traditional institutions are not,\u201d Black said. \u201cThis includes flexibility in courses and timing, offering skills demanded by employers, and accepting and accommodating students from a variety of backgrounds.\u201d\n\nIn the Tampa area, for-profit schools have come under fire from students and employees. In February 2013, a graduate sued Everest University, saying he was misled about his ability to transfer credits and that he racked up $27,000 in student debt for a degree he said has \u201cno value.\u201d\n\nAlso last year, a former employee of the Sanford-Brown Institute sued that school, saying she refused to go along with misrepresentations of placement and enrollment numbers.\n\nBut Tavarez, the Tampa student getting certified as a clinical mental health counselor, said she is satisfied with her experience. Unlike many of her peers, she did extensive research on Argosy University before enrolling.\n\n\u201cThe professors are great here, you get one-on-one time with them. I'm definitely happy with Argosy,\u201d she said.\n\njstockfisch@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7834", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 16 Feb 2014 21:32:15 -0400", "Description": "A new study concludes that 32 percent of alumni of for-profit schools saying their investment \u201creally wasn't worth it,\u201d with 30 percent saying it \u201cremains to be seen\u201d and 37 percent of alumni saying the experience was \u201cwell worth it.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "A new study concludes that 32 percent of alumni of for-profit schools saying their investment \u201creally wasn't worth it,\u201d with 30 percent saying it \u201cremains to be seen\u201d and 37 percent of alumni saying the experience was \u201cwell worth it.\u201d", "title": "Alumni split on value of degrees from for-profit colleges", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/education/alumni-split-on-value-of-degrees-from-for-profit-colleges-20140216/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140216/ARTICLE/140219378/AR/0/AR-140219378.jpg", "height": 426}, "updated_time": "2014-02-17T06:03:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "A new study concludes that 32 percent of alumni of for-profit schools saying their investment \u201creally wasn't worth it,\u201d with 30 percent saying it \u201cremains to be seen\u201d and 37 percent of alumni saying the experience was \u201cwell worth it.\u201d", "title": "Alumni split on value of degrees from for-profit colleges", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140216/ARTICLE/140219378/AR/0/AR-140219378.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-02-16T21:32:15Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-02-17T06:03:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Sixty-five percent of current for-profit students and 63 percent of alumni were unsure whether their school was a for-profit or not.\nThirty-seven percent of alumni said the experience was \u201cwell worth it.\u201dCount Tampa student Niulca Tavarez among the latter group.\nBut Tavarez, the Tampa student getting certified as a clinical mental health counselor, said she is satisfied with her experience.\nThe report also cited what its authors called the \u201cstartling lack of awareness\u201d among students about the overall concept of for-profit colleges.\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756The report said prospective students looking at a for-profit college say qualities like online learning, accelerated programs and hands-on support are key considerations."}
