Friends host blood drive in honor of a woman shot during an armed robbery in Derby in August.

Julie Dombo was shot at a Derby AT&T store on August 11th and is still recovering at a Wichita hospital.

More than 64 people signed up to donate.

Friends say Julie is strong while on the road to recovery.

"She's an amazing, strong woman. If anyone can make it through this, she can. She's got a very strong will to live and she's going to fight every step of the way," said Rhonda Landsverk.

Landsverk, one of the organizers of the blood drive, says they wanted way to say thanks to those who have helped save Julie's life.

"She had to use about 30 units of blood to this point and we thought what a better way to give back to pay it forward to those who gave her the gift of life."

Friends say the showing of support has been overwhelming and it's evident of how many lives she has impacted.

"She's always bubbly, always off the walls. If you are having a bad day you can always go to her and she always make it better. She's just a sweet heart. I'm giving back to her, for all the bad days that I had, a little blood goes a long way," said Traci McKelvey, Julie's coworker.

"More and more, everyday, we find out how much she's impacted. All the students' lives she's touched over the school years. It's been amazing," said Landsverk.

If you weren't able to make Monday's blood drive you can still donate in Julie's honor all week at the Wichita Blood Donation Center.

Friends are hosting another fundraiser for Julie.

It's a Walk/Run - Making Strides Against Gun Violence.

September 27th 1:00 PM beginning at the Derby Recreation Center, 801 East Market, Derby KS. Registration and packet pick up begins at noon.
