He said there has been \u201cunprecedented support\u201d opposing SAFE, and his 40,000 member strong group is committed to fighting SAFE.\n\nAssemblyman Steve Hawley (R., Batavia) also attended two rallies in the past two weeks and told the Free Beacon he continues to urge his constituents to fight the law, which was passed \u201cunder the cover of darkness\u201d without debate, public input and any surveys, and in \u201csecrecy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe SAFE Act is Governor Cuomo\u2019s Obamacare,\u201d Hawley said. He explained that even after a year of its passage, the Cuomo Administration is \u201cstill not prepared\u201d to enforce it, and \u201cone year later, it is still not ready to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fairly typical, like Obamacare,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic that it was exactly the same ending as Obamacare, how sad,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m for repeal for what I believe is an unconstitutional law,\u201d Hawley said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re viewed in upstate new York as relatively insignificant most of the time. We are not the enemy as Governor Cuomo has recently indicated,\u201d Hawley said, referring to the governor\u2019s recent remarks on \u201cextremists\u201d not being welcome in New York.\n\nOf the 62 total counties in the state, 52 have passed resolutions opposing the SAFE Act. In addition, more than 250 cities and towns also oppose it.\n\nBudd Schroeder, chairman of the board of the Shooters Committee on Political Education, said his group is planning to intensify its anti-SAFE efforts. A statewide meeting of SCOPE directors is scheduled for February to \u201cplan for the future,\u201d to ensure \u201cpeople are aware of the injustices of the SAFE Act and the uselessness of the SAFE Act.\u201d\n\nSCOPE has also approved 10 billboard ads in Albany.\n\nLast week Governor Cuomo said, \u201cSeventy percent of New Yorkers want intelligent gun control.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone wants intelligent gun control. The SAFE Act is stupid,\u201d said Schroeder. \u201cIntelligent gun control\u201d is \u201calready on the books\u201d on the federal, state and local level and has been \u201cfor ages.\u201d\n\n\u201cCriminals don\u2019t obey them,\u201d he said.\n\nA survey by NYRSPA also showed different numbers than Cuomo\u2019s assertion.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done a survey that shows 66 percent agree with us, that the Second Amendment is an unalienable right and an individual right versus a collective right,\u201d King said.\n\nCuomo\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLisa Donovan, cofounder of the NY2A Grassroots Coalition, said many educational forums will be held in the upcoming months to \u201cencourage people not to register their guns\u201d and \u201cnot to comply with the law.\u201d\n\nHer group is also alerting gun owners to options that will help them avoid being forced to register their guns, such as modifying them.\n\nHer group also plans on continuing to protest at the governor\u2019s public appearances.\n\n\u201cAny time Cuomo is making a public appearance, we show up.\u201d They were at Cuomo\u2019s state of the state address earlier this month.\n\nAnother grassroots group, the OtherSideNY, uses Twitter to spread the word about the SAFE Act. Tom Ireland, the president of that group, said by email that Cuomo\u2019s \u201cintent was not to make New York safer but to capitalize on the Sandy Hook tragedy to enhance his popularity nationally for a potential Presidential run.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost people who opposed this law find it difficult to understand why their 2nd Amendment rights have been limited when they have done nothing wrong,\u201d Ireland said.\n\n\u201cIt is our Second Amendment right being lessened and we will do everything in our power to ensure those who voted for the law will no longer be in office,\u201d King said. He predicted the legal battle of the law would land in the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t get rid of the law this year, we\u2019ll do our best to get rid of the people who voted for it,\u201d Schroeder said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Upstate New York continues to oppose strict new gun laws", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Second Amendment supporters are vowing to intensify their efforts in the upcoming months to repeal New York\u2019s SAFE Act and remove from office lawmakers facing re-election in November who voted for t", "title": "SAFE Act Opponents Intensify Efforts to Repeal Cuomo\u2019s Gun Control Law", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/safe-act-opponents-intensify-efforts-to-repeal-cuomos-gun-control-law/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Andrew-Cuomo-AP-150x150.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Second Amendment supporters are vowing to intensify their efforts in the upcoming months to repeal N", "creator": "@MaryLouByrd12", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Andrew-Cuomo-AP-150x150.png", "title": "SAFE Act Opponents Intensify Efforts to Repeal Cuomo\u2019s Gun Control Law", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m for repeal for what I believe is an unconstitutional law,\u201d Hawley said.\nBY: Follow @MaryLouByrd12Second Amendment supporters are vowing to intensify their efforts in the upcoming months to repeal New York\u2019s SAFE Act and remove from office lawmakers facing re-election in November who voted for the law.\nOf the 62 total counties in the state, 52 have passed resolutions opposing the SAFE Act.\nThe SAFE Act is stupid,\u201d said Schroeder.\nAnother grassroots group, the OtherSideNY, uses Twitter to spread the word about the SAFE Act."}
