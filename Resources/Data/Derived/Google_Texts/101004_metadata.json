(David R. Jennings / Daily Camera)\n\nThe disqualification came as the top relay team missed their heat of the preliminary round, and even after officials allowed a second-tier team to compete in a prelim, the Knights were not allowed to have an entry for the nightcap. That opened the door for Regis to take the team title, scoring 241.50 points to Fairview's 234.50.\n\n\"It's just one of those things that we'll have to take as a lesson, to always be ready for your race,\" Smartt said. \"The relay glitch was a big 'oops', but other than that we had a pretty good day.\"\n\nSeveral other swimmers could identify with Fairview's plight with the way the heats were being funneled in and out of the pool. It was a topic of conversation for many swimmers, including Centaurus' Haley Rowley. In about 15 minutes, Rowley swam the 500 freestyle, the 100 backstroke and a leg of the Centaurus' 400 relay consolation final swim.\n\nDespite that setback, there were plenty of shining moments for Fairview. Box finished third in a stacked 100 butterfly that included Fossil Ridge's Bailey Nero and Loveland's Brooke Hansen. Beetcher took third place in both the 200 and 500 freestyles. And Weller finished top-eight in both distance swims, too.\n\nFor Smartt, the highlight of the day was the 200 medley relay, which came within earshot of the school record with a time of 1 minute, 46.81 seconds. Box, Sidney Andrew, Sienna Stonesmith and Michaela Mullison helped FHS quickly move past the morning.\n\n\"Winning the medley against some really fast teams, that was just exciting,\" Smartt said. \"It's a consideration All-American time, so that tells you how fast they were.\n\n\"Julia, Brittany, Adee \u2014 they all had fine days today. We've got eight weeks to focus, and we had a number of girls who were close to placing. The challenge is to get those girls in the top 16, and for those in the top 16 to get to top eight.\"\n\nAndrew's breaststroke split in the relay was less than 30 seconds (29.9), and she said that adrenaline helped carry her through to a win in the consolation heat of the 200 IM about 5 minutes later. Her time of 2:09.65 would have been sixth in the championship heat.\n\n\"This was the first high school meet for me and a lot of the other club swimmers, so it was good to see where we compared at this point,\" said Andrew, who finished fourth in the 100 breaststroke (1:06.77). \"Honestly, I think we did really well. I know where I am concerned, there is room for improvement. I can tell you that split pumped me up for the IM.\"\n\nIndividually, Rowley \u2014 a former Boulder Panther \u2014 starred in the distance free race just a week after placing third in junior nationals in the mile. Her 4:52.96 in the 500 looked effortless, and she bounced right back to place third in the backstroke (57.15 seconds). If that wasn't enough, she took two laps in the cool-down pool and then helped CHS break a school record in the 400 relay (3:41.89, 10th place).\n\nThe current Boulder contingent, which did not qualify any relays to the afternoon session but still dropped times, had much to cheer for in junior standout Josie Valette. Still considering herself a newcomer to the butterfly, Valette set a school mark in the discipline with a time of 57.90 seconds \u2014 bettering the old BHS standard by a full second.\n\nShe also placed in the top seven in the 50 free, her signature race, giving her a bright smile at the end of the meet.\n\n\"I really just became a butterflyer last year, so I am still kind of figuring things out but definitely working on breakouts, turns and kickouts,\" Valette said. \"My 50 was only (five-hundredths) off my best time, and my turn was a little iffy. So I know I can do better.\n\n\"I'm really happy with the way (the fly) turned out.\"\n\nFor Monarch, Sidney Trimm placed second in the 100 freestyle (52.82) and fifth in the 50 free (24.26). The Coyotes also had two divers make the finals, with Grace Newell's eight-place finish contributing to MHS' 15th place team standing.\n\nFollow Adam on Twitter: twitter.com/AdamDunivan24\n\nColorado Coaches Invitational\n\nAt Veterans Memorial Aquatic Center\n\nTeam scores \u2014 Regis Jesuit 241.5, Fairview 234.5, Fossil Ridge 217, Arapahoe 144.5, Valor Christian 127, Cherry Creek 124, Grandview 112, Rock Canyon 112, Heritage 104, Rampart 68, Mountain Range 60.5, Loveland 60, Windsor 58, Centaurus 57, Monarch 51, Ralston Valley 50, Smoky Hill 49, Legend 42, Lakewood 37.5, Broomfield 35, Rocky Mountain 33, Chaparral 33, St. Mary's Academy 29, Silver Creek 25, ThunderRidge 21, Pomona 20, Boulder 19, Mullen 17, Chatfield 16, George Washington 16, Eaglecrest 14, D'Evelyn 14, Northglenn 13.5, Evergreen 12, Castle View 9, Skyline 9, Colorado Academy 8, Golden 7, Horizon 6, Niwot 5, Legacy 4, Mountain View 3, Greeley West 2, Fort Collins 2, Eaton 1.\n\n200 medley relay \u2014 1.
