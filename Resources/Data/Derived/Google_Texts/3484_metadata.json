State legislatures passed 29,000 laws in 2012. For the 2011\u20132012 legislative session, the number of bills enacted ranged from a low of 142 in Ohio to a high of 1,582 in Texas, but only 120 bills were passed in the U.S. Congress. Delaney\u2019s estimates for state legislatures in 2013 are even higher, and for Congress, even lower.\n\n\u201cGiven the pervasive gridlock in Congress, key legislative change is occurring predominantly in the states,\u201d Jackman writes. \u201cIt is, then, all the more important to know who is affecting which bills are introduced in the state legislatures, and which bills pass.\u201d Her analysis is an attempt, using text analysis, to figure out which of these state laws are based on ALEC model legislation.\n\nJackman\u2019s conclusions: \u201cFirst, ALEC model bills are, word-for-word, introduced in our state legislatures at a non-trivial rate. Second, they have a good chance\u2014better than most legislation\u2014of being enacted into law. Finally, the bills that pass are most often linked to controversial social and economic issues.\u201d\n\nJackman tracked the language of 169 model ALEC bills in nine ALEC task force topical areas introduced in 2011\u20132012 and found 132 actual bills that appeared to be attributable to ALEC. Contrary to our expectation of ALEC as an almost exclusively Republican instrument, Jackman discovered that Democrats sponsored almost 18 percent of the ALEC-linked bills. The states with the most ALEC legislative introductions were West Virginia (10 ALEC bills), Oklahoma (9), Mississippi (9), Arizona (8), Kansas (7), and Montana (7).\n\nThe strategically reoriented ALEC may have moved away from gun rights and \u201ccastle doctrine\u201d bills, but in the 2011\u20132012 cycle, nine state legislatures saw the introduction of the \u201cCastle Doctrine Act\u201d (stand-your-ground legislation) making it among the most common ALEC-themed bill in state legislatures. Other common ALEC bills in state legislatures were the \u201cNo Sanctuary Cities for Illegal Immigrants Act\u201d (creating a crime of trespassing on state land without immigrant status and a crime of having undocumented immigrant in one\u2019s vehicle) and laws that would prohibit local jurisdictions from independently regulating possession of firearms and preempt local jurisdictions from bringing civil actions against firearm manufacturers or dealers. Jackson says that nine percent of the ALEC bills\u201412 out of 132\u2014were enacted (a thirteenth was vetoed by the New Hampshire governor). That\u2019s not a high rate of passage, but much higher than that of Congress, where many bills enacted are not particularly controversial, like the naming of post offices.\n\nOur guess is that, having been burned by ALEC\u2019s overly close association with social issues such as stand-your-ground, corporations will be reluctant partners of ALEC\u2019s unless ALEC focuses on corporate bread-and-butter concerns such as taxation and regulation.\n\nCorporations may be itchy about their ALEC connections, but for many legislators, ALEC\u2019s research and model bills give them useful tools for their conservative legislative agendas. In Wisconsin, for example, roughly a third of state legislators may be ALEC members, while in Georgia, the proportion is 38 percent. Overall, ALEC\u2019s website claims over 2,000 members, the vast majority of whom are legislators, since foundation and corporate members total only around 300. If you\u2019re a state legislator, perhaps serving part-time with very limited staff support, having ALEC generating model bills, background research, and talking points is a valuable asset.\n\nThe narrowing of ALEC\u2019s agenda away from hot-button gun control and crime issues doesn\u2019t mean that ALEC\u2019s reach is all that narrow. For example, as we have reported earlier, ALEC is making a big push into such education issues as promoting school choice legislation and for-profit higher education. While the Affordable Care Act calls for expanded Medicaid coverage, ALEC is calling for huge cuts in Medicaid. Jackman\u2019s research is a roadmap on where ALEC has been, but with directions for where ALEC might go in the future on a variety of issues of concern to corporate America.\u2014Rick Cohen", "article_metadata": {"description": "A research fellow at the Brookings Institution has sorted through state legislation across the nation to figure out which ones are based on the model bills generated by the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).", "original-source": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2013/12/11/roadmap-to-alec-s-model-bills-in-state-legislatures/", "og": {"site_name": "Non Profit News For Nonprofit Organizations | Nonprofit Quarterly", "description": "A research fellow at the Brookings Institution has sorted through state legislation across the nation to figure out which ones are based on the model bills generated by the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).", "title": "Roadmap to ALEC\u2019s Model Bills in State Legislatures", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/56/files/2013/12/ALEC.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-16T16:06:33+00:00", "url": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2013/12/11/roadmap-to-alec-s-model-bills-in-state-legislatures/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/56/files/2013/12/ALEC.jpg", "description": "A research fellow at the Brookings Institution has sorted through state legislation across the nation to figure out which ones are based on the model bills generated by the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).", "site": "@npquarterly", "card": "summary", "title": "Roadmap to ALEC\u2019s Model Bills in State Legislatures - Non Profit News For Nonprofit Organizations | Nonprofit Quarterly"}, "syndication-source": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2013/12/11/roadmap-to-alec-s-model-bills-in-state-legislatures/", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "Policies and Laws", "published_time": "2013-12-11T15:42:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-16T16:06:33+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "News, Policy, Education, Government, Organizational Management and Change, Policies and Laws"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc960e\"", "article_summary": "Jackman\u2019s conclusions: \u201cFirst, ALEC model bills are, word-for-word, introduced in our state legislatures at a non-trivial rate.\nDelaney\u2019s estimates for state legislatures in 2013 are even higher, and for Congress, even lower.\nThe states with the most ALEC legislative introductions were West Virginia (10 ALEC bills), Oklahoma (9), Mississippi (9), Arizona (8), Kansas (7), and Montana (7).\nState legislatures passed 29,000 laws in 2012.\nCorporations may be itchy about their ALEC connections, but for many legislators, ALEC\u2019s research and model bills give them useful tools for their conservative legislative agendas."}
