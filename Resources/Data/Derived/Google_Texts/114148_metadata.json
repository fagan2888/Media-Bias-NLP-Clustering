But there\u2019s also decor for those who prefer to welcome the season with more homespun serenity.\n\nMany of these items reference nature with quiet wintry hues and rustic textures. You can imagine fireplaces ablaze, skis and skates at the ready and cozy lodges set up for holiday gatherings.\n\n\u201cWe love all the adorable woodland-themed decorations on everything from pillows and throws to ornaments and tableware,\u201d says HGTV Magazine\u2019s Sara Peterson.\n\nCollections of these creatures \u2014 deer, foxes, bears and so on \u2014 are available in any number of crafted forms: bottlebrush squirrels, raccoons and hedgehogs at Pottery Barn, faux fur and fiber owls and moose at West Elm.\n\nPlaid mitten, heart and tree ornaments are part of Target\u2019s Smith & Hawken holiday collection.\n\n\u201cAdvent garlands are popular this year too. Garlands with fabric pouches that count down to Christmas, or a string of colorful envelopes,\u201d notes Peterson.\n\nGerman designer Irmi Black makes a knitted mitten Advent garland; small treats can be tucked in each mitten and the garland can be used as an organizer after the holidays. Target\u2019s Threshold Rustic Advent Calendar is a veritable mini-cabin, with tiny drawers printed with snowflakes, trees and seasonal patterns (search for Black\u2019s work on etsy.com).\n\nIf you\u2019re crafty, consider making your own garland. Stamp kits, swatches of fabric and felt, and a ball or two of wool will set you on your way.\n\nA collection of wooden trees to decorate a tabletop or mantel can be found at Homegoods, as well as some cozy Fair Isle-patterned throws with a ski chalet vibe.\n\nAnother option: Fill large clear hurricanes with tin jingle bells, birch branches or white painted twigs, or make a non-edible version of holiday trifle with layers of faux snow or moss and tiny red ornaments.\n\nArtist Rachel Kozlowski\u2019s imaginative plates have found a following beyond her Etsy.com fans; she\u2019s featured at West Elm this season with a collection of Dapper Animal plates: bears with trapper hats, owls in plaid shirts and other whimsical designs. At her Etsy shop, a plate features a moose emerging from a woodsy plaid backgroun. (etsy.com/shop/RKArtwork).\n\nIf you\u2019d like to take the chalet theme in a more literal direction, consider decorating with actual skis and snowboards. The artwork on many snowboards has great graphic oomph. Use a board as the focal point for a mantel display, adding ornaments or pine rope to reference the holidays. (ridesnowboards.com ; 2snowboarding.com) You can find old skis or other antique winter-sport gear at antique stores.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Christmas decorations with a rustic vibe fit Colorado", "title": "Christmas decorations with a rustic vibe fit Colorado", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/20/christmas-decorations-with-a-rustic-vibe-fit-colorado/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131220__20131221_C2_fe21ahcabinp2.jpg", "height": 593}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131220__20131221_C2_fe21ahcabinp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-20T16:28:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T11:51:50+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd838c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe love all the adorable woodland-themed decorations on everything from pillows and throws to ornaments and tableware,\u201d says HGTV Magazine\u2019s Sara Peterson.\nYou can imagine fireplaces ablaze, skis and skates at the ready and cozy lodges set up for holiday gatherings.\nStores are full of ornaments and sparkly d\u00e9cor that set the holiday tone with glamour and panache.\nUse a board as the focal point for a mantel display, adding ornaments or pine rope to reference the holidays.\nTarget\u2019s Threshold Rustic Advent Calendar is a veritable mini-cabin, with tiny drawers printed with snowflakes, trees and seasonal patterns (search for Black\u2019s work on etsy.com)."}
