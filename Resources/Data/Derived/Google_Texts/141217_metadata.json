What follows is the transcript for Episode 19, in which Slate\u2019s Dahlia Lithwick chats about the biggest decisions of the Supreme Court\u2019s 2014 term and checks in with SCOTUSblog publisher Tom Goldstein about what\u2019s at stake. Lithwick also chats with Jessica Mason Pieklo, senior legal analyst at RH Reality Check about some of the big abortion cases that might soon be headed to court.

This is a lightly edited transcript and may differ slightly from the edited podcast.\n\nDahlia Lithwick Dahlia Lithwick writes about the courts and the law for Slate, and hosts the podcast Amicus.\n\n\n\nDahlia Lithwick: Welcome to Amicus, Slate\u2019s Supreme Court podcast. I\u2019m Dahlia Lithwick, Slate\u2019s Supreme Court correspondent, and welcome to June\u2014or as we court watchers like to think of it, the \u201cnerd Super Bowl.\u201d In the next four weeks, the biggest decisions of the 2014 term will rain down upon us, and today on the show we\u2019re going to try to take a look at what\u2019s in stake in some of these monster cases.\n\nLater on in the show, we\u2019re going to consider the wave of abortion cases that might be soon heading toward the Supreme Court, but first we want to take stock of the big cases that are already there. Now, you may remember that on the very first episode of this podcast, we were lucky enough to be joined by veteran Supreme Court watcher and practitioner Tom Goldstein, the publisher of SCOTUSblog, and he predicted that the court was going to hear this little sleeper case called King v. Burwell. And they did, so we wanted to have you back, Tom, to do maybe a little \u201cI told you so\u201d dance and to tell us what is going to happen. So, Tom, thank you for coming back to the show.\n\nTom Goldstein: Are you kidding? Thank you so much for having me. The wonderful thing about predictions is that you can make a ton of them, and then one comes true and you can go, \u201cI told you so!\u201d And we can just forget about all the ones I got wrong.\n\nLithwick: Well, why don\u2019t you start by saying, \u201cI told you so\u201d? We were talking about King at the very, very beginning of October. Let\u2019s start there. We\u2019re waiting for that to come down. It\u2019s a big, big deal of a case. Can you just briefly summarize what this Obamacare 2.0 is about?\n\nGoldstein: You bet. So, a few years ago, everybody who\u2019s listening to this podcast, at least, will remember the constitutional challenge to Obamacare and whether Congress had the power to pass that law. This is not a case like that one. Instead, it\u2019s a question of whether there\u2019s effectively a glitch in the statute that blows the thing up.\n\nSo, the heart and beating soul of the ACA are these subsides, because the subsidies that are given out to lower-income individuals who want to buy health care bring them into the insurance pool, and allow the insurers to know that they have a good number of healthy people that they are providing insurance to who probably won\u2019t need a ton of care.\n\nSo, everything really turns on the subsidies, but the statute says that you\u2019re eligible for the subsidies if you purchase insurance on a health exchange\u2014which is how the purchases are made\u2014established by a state. Now, in the wake of Republican opposition and Tea Party opposition to the ACA, a bunch of those exchanges were established by the federal government rather than a state, but there are provisions in the law that certainly indicate that the federal government plays the role of a state when it comes to the exchanges. So, the lower courts split on the question of Does it mean that you literally have to buy health insurance on an exchange established by a state, not one that is run for the state by the federal government?\n\nIf that\u2019s true, then in two-thirds-ish of the country\u2019s people aren\u2019t eligible for the subsidies, and therefore they won\u2019t be in the insurance pool, and therefore the whole thing kind of goes to heck.\n\nLithwick: The thing that was striking to a lot of us who were present at oral argument in that case was that the chief justice, who shocked everybody last time and voted with the liberals to uphold the ACA, was almost completely silent, which is rare for him. He said almost nothing. And so for folks who were hoping for some kind of some signals about what he planned to do, we got nothing. Were there other things that happened at oral argument that give you any basis from which to believe this case is going to go one way or another?\n\nGoldstein: Oh, we love to prognosticate, and so we can just look at people\u2019s facial expressions and we\u2019ll come up with something. But I do think the chief justice, both in that case and in same-sex marriage, had kind of grown weary of people using questions to predict the outcomes, and so I think he shut down probably on purpose.\n\nIn terms of whether the government can get a fifth vote\u2014because it almost certainly has four votes from the court\u2019s more liberal members\u2014I think they have to be encouraged by what Justice Kennedy said, because his take on the case at one point was Look, if it\u2019s the case that Congress was saying to the states, if you don\u2019t set up the exchange\u2014personally, if you will\u2014then I\u2019m going to take these subsidies away from all of your lower-income citizens, and they won\u2019t be able to buy insurance, and the health insurance marketplace won\u2019t operate in your state.\n\nIf you\u2019re saying that to the challengers, then I really worry about whether the law would have been constitutional to begin with, because that just seems to really be extortion of the state. So, maybe we shouldn\u2019t read it that way. Maybe we shouldn\u2019t mean that the federal government was staying to the states, You have to do this or there\u2019s going to be a world of hurt for your citizens. And Justice Kennedy is the ideological center of the court and he\u2019s certainly a candidate for the government to pick up its fifth vote, and if I were them, I would have been encouraged by that.\n\nLithwick: We\u2019re remembering that we had Jonathan Adler on the show right before King was argued, and he\u2019s one of the architects of this challenge. And he said, If I\u2019m going to lose, at least let me lose on this federalism argument, this states\u2019 rights argument, because I could live with that.\n\nSo, let\u2019s talk while we\u2019re prognosticating about the other big, big case that everybody\u2019s looking at, and that is obviously the marriage case, Obergefell. Again, a really, really enormous amount of weight put on who said what and whose eyebrow went in which direction at oral argument, but do you have a sense after argument of what we\u2019re going to see happen in the coming weeks?\n\nGoldstein: Again, I think the justices\u2014particularly the chief, and to some extent Justice Kennedy\u2014were playing coy at oral argument to avoid just a world of predictions. The \u201cgoing in\u201d assumption was that the court was going to recognize a right to same-sex marriage, and I don\u2019t think anything in the oral argument changed that \u201cgoing in\u201d assumption, which was based on what the court had done in terms of not stopping decisions that had recognized this right from the lower courts, and a variety of other tea-leafy kinds of things.\n\nIn terms of what happened at the oral argument itself, again, Justice Kennedy here really is the critical vote. He\u2019s kind of a hero to the gay rights movement in the United States and has really authorized some of the seminal opinions recognizing that there\u2019s invidious discrimination against homosexuals, and Justice Kennedy made some comments about the dignitary interest in having equal rights when it comes to getting married.\n\nBut the biggest thing for me was what didn\u2019t happen at the oral argument. And the oral argument was split in two. The first hour and a half was Hey, is there a right to same-sex marriage? The second hour was Well, if there\u2019s not a right to same-sex marriage, if you go to a state that has legislated this right and get married and you go back to your home state\u2014so, you go from Connecticut or Maryland and you go back to Texas\u2014does Texas have to recognize your marriage? Which is an interesting question if you are not going to recognize same-sex marriage, but there was almost no interest and no energy in the court in that question at all. Everybody seemed to be like, OK, this is over.\n\nAnd I think that Justice Kennedy, if he wasn\u2019t going to recognize the right, would have been much, much more interested in this question of whether you can take a marriage from one state to another.\n\nLithwick: Tom, do you think it has any impact on the justices, the conversation about People are going to lose things? So that in both King\u2014right, we\u2019re looking at possibly millions of people losing the subsidies that make health care affordable, in the marriage case, just the fact that the train has left the station and there are all these marriages. Does that matter to the justices? Do they look around and say, This is done?\n\nGoldstein: It does matter. It\u2019s not going to decide the case, but they are conservative in many different ways and one is, they prefer not to upset the apple cart. And taking away health insurance from millions of people is something that\u2019s going to give them a lot of heartburn. That\u2019s particularly true with respect to both same-sex marriage and with respect to health care, where it is in effect the federal courts that allowed all of these individuals to develop this reliance interest in what the existing law was. They got married, they got health insurance.\n\nThe only other thing I\u2019ll say about same-sex marriage is that you can point a little bit in the other direction, and that is there will be more conservative members of the court who will say, Look, the country\u2019s changing. Over time this right is being recognized by the states and by legislatures. People are being convinced that this is the right thing to do, and that\u2019s how our country ought to work. It ought not to be imposed as a constitutional mandate. I don\u2019t think in the end that\u2019s what will persuade Justice Kennedy, though.\n\nLithwick: There are so many cases I want to ask you about. They are all raining down upon us. But I want to ask you, is there a case, Tom, that nobody\u2019s paying attention to, that if we were smart we would be watching for in the coming weeks?\n\nGoldstein: To mention the cases for the future just very briefly, the court is taking up a super-important question about \u201cone person, one vote,\u201d which is the rule that says that voting districts generally have to be the same size, including, particularly, federal congressional districts, in terms of their population.\n\nAnd the question is: Well, what kind of population? Is it everybody who lives there, or is it the voters? Are we looking for an equal number of voters, or are we saying that the representatives need to represent the same number of people even if they aren\u2019t eligible to vote? And that\u2019s a case for the next term.\n\nThen the three cases that they could announce that they are going to decide in the next few days are about to what extent you have a right to a gun in your house, whether affirmative action in higher education is constitutional, and how far a state can go in restricting abortion clinics, and where they have to be, and what kind of facilities they have to provide. So, the justices could be wading into three more legs of the stool of hot-button social issues.\n\nLithwick: Just when you think it can\u2019t get any crazier. Tommy, the last question I have before we let you go is simply this. SCOTUSblog has become, in addition to the must-see site for all things SCOTUS, the repository of all this great statistical information. You guys keep track of every vote and what\u2019s going on. Can you talk just briefly about some of the strength voting alignments and patterns that we\u2019ve seen this term? It seems to me that it\u2019s neither the sort of 9\u20130, 8\u20131 terms that we\u2019ve seen before, nor is it the typical liberals-versus-conservatives. It seems like there\u2019s something going on with the statistics. I know it\u2019s early and we\u2019ve got a lot of cases to come, but can you give us a little glimpse into the data that SCOTUSblog is collecting?\n\nGoldstein: Sure, we do have a really interesting term shaping up if the trends continue. Usually around this time of year when we\u2019re getting to the last month, what we\u2019ve got is a huge bunch of 9\u20130 and 8\u20131 decisions like you mentioned, because those are the easy ones and we\u2019re waiting for the hard ones, which just take longer. This term we have a higher-than-usual proportion of closely divided cases, but weirdly closely divided.\n\nThe court has kind of fallen into the following pattern, and that is that if it\u2019s a huge ideological fight, we\u2019ll fight it out 5\u20134, but besides that we\u2019re all going to try and get along. And so you have a big gap between the 9\u20130 and 8\u20131 decisions and the 5\u20134 and 6\u20133 decisions, and those really did have overwhelmingly an ideological valance.\n\nBut it seems to me almost like it has to be the case that one of two things is happening. One is, the court is getting more comfortable. We\u2019re now many years into the Roberts court, and they are settling in and coming to understand each other better, respect each other better, and being more nuanced in their thinking. And that leads to not just these ordinary ideological 5\u20134s, or there\u2019s a conscious effort afoot among the justices to show that they aren\u2019t just ideologues. The ideological lines in the Supreme Court for the first time in a super-long time fall along party appointment. The conservatives are all Republican appointees, and the more liberal justices are all Democratic appointees, and I think the court is concerned about how it\u2019s perceived out there in the country. And so, I bet they love\u2014love, love, love\u2014that you\u2019ve got the Chief Justice and then the liberals, which hasn\u2019t happened really since Chief Justice Roberts\u2019 first term other than the big Obamacare case. And other decisions like that in which it\u2019s much more, you know, throw the justices into a blender and see who comes out.\n\nLithwick: Tom Goldstein, thank you so much for being on the show. Tom Goldstein is the founder of SCOTUSblog, a well-known appellate advocate at the Supreme Court, and the, really, godfather of thinking about the court in deep ways online in our time. Tommy Goldstein, thank you for joining us on Amicus.\n\nGoldstein: Well, thank you for all those very kind lies!\n\nLithwick: This week the Supreme Court is trying to decide if they are going to take a major abortion case, and behind that there are teed up several other abortion cases that look very much like they are going to end up at the court. So, we\u2019re turning now to Jessica Mason Pieklo. She\u2019s the senior legal analyst at the website RH Reality Check. She thinks and writes all the time about the relationship between reproductive rights and the courts. Jessica, welcome to Amicus.\n\nJessica Mason Pieklo: Oh, thank you so much for having me. It is an absolute pleasure to be here.\n\nLithwick: So, we\u2019ve seen a huge uptick of abortion restrictions since I guess 2010, when Republicans took over state houses and passed just hundreds\u2014literally\u2014of regulations that would limit access to abortions. It seems like they\u2019re now\u2014only now\u2014really making their way very quickly to the courts, and I wonder if you could start by just talking about what abortion cases look like they might get to the court\u2014the U.S. Supreme Court\u2014awfully soon?\n\nMason Pieklo: Right. So, we have one that the Roberts court is taking a look at right now, and that\u2019s in Mississippi, and it involves admitting-privileges requirements. That\u2019s a requirement that abortion providers in the state must have admitting privileges at local hospitals in order to perform abortions in the state, or face criminal sanctions.\n\nNow, there was a big fight last year in Texas about a bill that they passed, HB2, and that was one of the requirements. The 5th Circuit said that even though this requirement is going to shut down nearly all the clinics in the Rio Grande Valley and that you\u2019re going to have wide splotches of basically reproductive health care deserts, the Roberts court kind of gave that one a pass. Mississippi has an almost identical law, but the difference in Mississippi is that if that law gets enacted, then the state loses its only clinic.\n\nAnd so where the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals said Texas could enforce its admitting-privilege requirement, the same Court of Appeals\u2014a different panel, but it\u2019s in the same circuit\u2014said Mississippi could not. And so, the state of Mississippi has appealed that decision to the Roberts court and we could hear as early as sometime in June that that\u2019s a case that they could take up. If they do, that question would be, then, Can a state constitutionally regulate out of existence within its borders?\u2014is one way to look at that.\n\nLithwick: So now, a reasonable person might say, Hey, what\u2019s wrong with having admitting privileges, right? I mean, you just want to make sure that if the worst possible outcomes happen, that a doctor can quickly whisk an abortion patient to a local hospital. It sounds\u2014and certainly it was intended to sound\u2014eminently reasonable. Explain why it doesn\u2019t always work that way.\n\nMason Pieklo: I think that\u2019s an excellent question, and you hit the argument exactly right on the head. Which is, this is supposed to promote patient safety, but the evidence from the medical profession\u2014who is almost entirely uniformly against these provisions\u2014is that they are unnecessary and that what they do is actually burden patient care, because there\u2019s a whole political process that often has nothing to do with patient outcomes and hospitals determining whether to grant privileges, for example, or not.\n\nAnother factor you can consider that is the impact of Catholic consolidation on health care, and in some states, like Michigan, they own a third to almost half of the hospitals and will just not, based on a moral objection, grant privileges to providers in that regards. So, when you peel back the layers on the patient safety onion, it really does start to stink.\n\nLithwick: So, can you help us understand\u2014and maybe go all the way back to Roe v. Wade, if you would be so good\u2014what is the text for what makes an abortion regulation constitutional, and how has it changed, and how does that shape the way the U.S. Supreme Court is going to look at it?\n\nMason Pieklo: Oh, wow. OK, yes, I will do my best. That\u2019s a huge question. But when we talk about the right to an abortion and whether or not states can\u2014or to the extent that states can regulate that\u2014the test that the Supreme Court created is this \u201cundue burden\u201d test. And that is, does the proposed regulation create an undue burden on a woman\u2019s right to choose?\n\nAnd lawyers like to make things very complicated, and so it\u2019s not just Is there an undue burden? Like, you would think just intuitively that closing all of the abortion clinics in the state of Mississippi would create an undue burden, but there\u2019s actually an analytical process that the court develops. One of those factors is Does the law have the purpose or effect of creating some substantial hurdles to a patient\u2019s ability to access and choose abortion?\n\nAnd as you might imagine, the courts are all over the place in terms of what that means, which is one of the reasons why we will get an abortion case before the Roberts court pretty soon.\n\nLithwick: I wonder if you would talk a little bit about other kinds of regulations. We\u2019ve talked about admitting privileges, but of course that\u2019s only one of many sorts we\u2019ve got swirling in the ether. We have 12-week bans and 20-week bans. You mentioned mandatory ultrasounds. What is going on out there that is likely to reach the Supreme Court really soon? And I know I\u2019m asking you another monster, unfair question, but just if you could give us a little breakdown of what are the kinds of cases that are bubbling up through the system. That would be super-helpful.\n\nMason Pieklo: So, yes, the Mississippi admitting-privileges case the court has before it right now and is deciding whether or not it wants to take a look at it. There is another petition pending, although the court hasn\u2019t conferenced on it yet, on North Carolina\u2019s mandatory-ultrasound law. Those were much more popular about 2011 or so, and that one has circulated back up. That\u2019s not scheduled for conference, and so I\u2019m not too concerned about that one yet.\n\nBut the cases that I think people really need to pay attention to are the ones that you mentioned. Arkansas has on its books a 12-week ban. North Dakota has a six-week ban. Nationally we\u2019re debating a 20-week ban. These are all pre-viability abortion bans even though the lawmakers may not call them \u201cpre-viability abortion bans.\u201d They may call them \u201cfeel pain\u201d bans or \u201cheartbeat\u201d bans, but they all have something in common and that is that they seek to ban abortions prior to fetal viability, which the Supreme Court has said states can\u2019t do.\n\nTwo important cases, the case challenging the Arkansas 12-week ban and the case challenging the North Dakota six-week ban, those are currently alive in the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals, which is a pretty conservative federal appeals court. I kind of joke that they were the 5th Circuit before the 5th Circuit was the 5th Circuit on abortion rights, in terms of their wiliness to sort of uphold anything.\n\nThe North Dakota case and the Arkansas case were heard together even though they\u2019re different bills and laws, because they impact many of the same issues. Just recently, the 8th Circuit issued an opinion that upheld the block on the Arkansas law but basically said viability is in play\u2014that if the state of Arkansas had given the 8th Circuit and the trial court more evidence, then it could find that the state can decide when viability begins and restrict abortion according to that.\n\nThat\u2019s important because in the North Dakota case, attorneys for North Dakota argued that as far as they\u2019re concerned, viability begins at conception, and so states can if they want ban abortion at the point of conception and there\u2019s very little that the courts can do with it. The 8th Circuit has not ruled on that North Dakota case, and that is giving me quite a bit of pause.\n\nLithwick: Talk a little bit, Jessica, about the fact that the U.S. Supreme Court just hasn\u2019t taken an abortion case in a long time. It\u2019s striking that we\u2019re talking about same-sex marriage, and in the amount of time that the court has heard several marriage equality cases and really, I think, moved the ball dramatically doctrinally, we\u2019ve had radio silence on reproductive rights cases. I suppose that\u2019s bracketing Hobby Lobby, which is a reproductive rights case that the court has taken, but why does the court not want to wade back into this?\n\nMason Pieklo: You know, I think that that is a great question, and I would ask Justice Anthony Kennedy in particular on that. I mean, I think that one of the things that is really interesting about the Mississippi case and could prove to just be too much for the court to resist is, there\u2019s a defense by Justice Garza in the 5th Circuit that talks about the rights of privacy and the freedom of movement, and the fact that our constitutional rights are not defined alone by the states that we live in. And that is a really dangerous way, in my opinion, of sort of flipping ideas of federalism when it comes to fundamental rights.\n\nBut there have been a lot of really big political decisions before the court, and maybe some of the answers\u2014because the chief justice is looking to pick only a few really high-profile, high political cases at time for the court to weigh in on, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to be able to avoid it for much longer.\n\nLithwick: I think that\u2019s right, and I think it\u2019s certainly the case that some of these restrictions are passed deliberately flouting the \u201cundue burden\u201d test and deliberately flouting doctrine in order to force it back to the court, under the theory that if they would just overturn Roe, we could all sleep better at night. And so, it does seem that there\u2019s an aggressiveness in the lower courts and an aggressiveness in the legislatures that is matched amazingly by \u201cmeh\u201d at the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nMason Pieklo: It\u2019s really interesting, and that aggressiveness was on full display in the 8th Circuit oral arguments, where you had one of the attorneys for the state of Arkansas make the argument that the facts and circumstances underpinning Roe simply no longer exist because the majority of states now have safe-haven laws that allow women to turn over their infants to the state should they not be able to care for them.\n\nAnd then you follow that up with the attorney from North Dakota arguing that the purpose of North Dakota\u2019s six-week ban was absolutely to bring a direct challenge to Roe. They submitted affidavits from anti-choice medical experts that says in their opinion, because IVF zygotes can live outside of the womb in a Petri dish for three days, that that supports a legislative finding that conception and viability are the same thing for purposes of restricting abortion.\n\nIf the Roberts court continues to stay out of the right, we\u2019ll have a patchwork mess of laws, but then I hope maybe the silver lining to that would be that some of these legislators and litigators get the message that there is a limit even with the conservatives on the court, who have made it very clear that they\u2019re not a fan of abortion rights.\n\nLithwick: Jessica Mason Pieklo is the senior legal analyst at RH Reality Check and a really indispensable analyst of these reproductive rights cases.
