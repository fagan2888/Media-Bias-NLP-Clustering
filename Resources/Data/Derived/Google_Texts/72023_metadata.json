Their payments are reduced by 1 percent for the fiscal year that began in October, according to the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nThis year, 758 hospitals are being penalized nationwide, compared to 724 last year. More than half of those hospitals were fined last year.\n\nTwenty-one Michigan hospitals made the list last year.\n\nHospitals receive a Hospital-Acquired Condition score between 1 and 10. Penalties were imposed to hospitals that received a score greater than 6.75.\n\nThe overall score is based on four measures: central line-associated bloodstream infections, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, surgical site infections (colon and hysterectomy), and a patient safety indicator assessed to each hospital. The patient safety rating looks at the frequency of ulcers, sepsis, punctures, hip fractures, collapsed lungs, as well as other infections and injuries.\n\nThese are the 24 Michigan hospitals that ranked in the bottom quartile nationally, according to the Economic Alliance for Michigan:\n\n\u2022 Borgess Medical Center in Kalamazoo\n\n\u2022 Carson City Hospital in Carson City\n\n\u2022 DMC Detroit Receiving Hospital in Detroit\n\n\u2022 DMC Harper University Hospital in Detroit\n\n\u2022 DMC Sinai-Grace in Detroit\n\n\u2022 Doctor's Hospital of Michigan in Pontiac\n\n\u2022 Genesys Regional Medical Center in Grand Blanc\n\n\u2022 Henry Ford Macomb in Clinton Township\n\n\u2022 Hurley Medical Center in Flint\n\n\u2022 McLaren Flint in Flint\n\n\u2022 McLaren Macomb in Mt.
