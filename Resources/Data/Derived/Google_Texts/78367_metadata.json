The Hutch Post reports the charge stems from his sexual acts with a 12-year-old girl.\n\nAs part of a plea agreement, Peterson pleaded no contest aggravated indecent solicitation. A judge sentenced him to 32 months in prison, but suspended the prison sentence and granted him three years probation under Community Corrections.\n\nPeterson made contact with the girl through an internet site called \u201cHot or Not\u201d and then met up with her in September of 2014, when the alleged sexual encounter occurred.\n\nThe Post reports the girl indicated on the website that she was older and didn't tell Peterson her real age. She reportedly punched him and ran away from him after the incident.\n\nPeterson has already registered as a sex offender in Sedgwick County where he lives.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Samuel Peterson was originally charged with aggravated indecent liberties with a child.", "language": "english", "author": "KAKE News", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Wichita-man-avoids-prison-time-in-Reno-County-child-sex-case-367971471.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Samuel+Peterson1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Samuel Peterson was originally charged with aggravated indecent liberties with a child.", "title": "Wichita man avoids prison in Reno County child sex case"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Samuel Peterson was originally charged with aggravated indecent liberties with a child.", "title": "Wichita man avoids prison in Reno County child sex case", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Wichita-man-avoids-prison-time-in-Reno-County-child-sex-case-367971471.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Samuel+Peterson1.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Wichita man avoids prison in Reno County child sex case", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Wichita man avoids prison in, Reno County child sex case"}, "article_summary": "A 20-year-old Wichita man avoids a prison sentence in a child sex case in Reno County.\nA judge sentenced him to 32 months in prison, but suspended the prison sentence and granted him three years probation under Community Corrections.\nThe Post reports the girl indicated on the website that she was older and didn't tell Peterson her real age.\nThe Hutch Post reports the charge stems from his sexual acts with a 12-year-old girl.\nPeterson has already registered as a sex offender in Sedgwick County where he lives."}
