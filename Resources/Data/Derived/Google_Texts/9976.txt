A Greeley dog breeder is searching for five English Bulldog puppies she says were stolen from her farm early Saturday morning.

Kandace Diekman says the puppies were taken between about 1 a.m. and 7 a.m. and that she suspects three people were involved in the heist. The dogs were in a locked building on her farm, which lies at the end of a roughly quarter-mile driveway.

“No solid leads yet,” Diekman said. “Everybody has been looking on Facebook, on Craigslist.”

The puppies were 13 weeks old and could be sold for as much as $1,500 each.

Diekman, who is offering a $2,000 reward for the dogs, says the puppies are a rare breed that need a special diet and have unique medical needs.

“I think somebody just heard about them or found out about them,” she said of why they were taken.

Diekman has filed a report with the Weld County Sheriff’s Office and has been searching nationally for the pups, which do have identifying microchips. The office confirmed the investigation Sunday.

“They’re just my life,” she said. “They’re everything.”
