Under the new state law, a student must have had an IEP within the last 18 months to qualify for the program. Federal law mandates that IEPs only can be issued by a public school.\n\nIt is likely the students who did not qualify for the program were not in the public schools.\n\nThe state department news release said it would continue to accept applications for the program as long as funds remain available.\n\nThe Legislature passed the controversial legislation during the 2015 session to create a five-year pilot program to provide the public funds to allow special-needs children to leave the public schools to pursue private education options.\n\nSen. Nancy Collins, R-Tupelo, was the primary author of the legislation. She said the public schools were not meeting the needs of many special-needs children.\n\n\u201cSpecial-needs students deserve the opportunity to succeed, and this bill gives parents the power to provide additional resources to help their children obtain the education and support they need,\u201d Gov. Phil Bryant said when the Legislature passed the bill.\n\nBut others argued the bill was more about taking funds out of the public schools and would do little to help the about 65,000 special-needs students in public schools.\n\n\u201cIf you care about students with special needs, this bill doesn\u2019t do much for them. If you want to establish a voucher program, this is your bill,\u201d Sen. Hob Bryan, D-Amory said at the time.\n\nThe Legislature appropriated $3 million for the program during the current fiscal year. This will cover 434 students, plus the administrative costs for the state Department of Education to administer the program.\n\nAt the time the bill was passed, the estimates were that when fully enacted in five years, it would cost $16.3 million in state funds to provide the subsidies for less than 2,500 students.\n\nBryan said the money in the program would not be enough to pay for the education of many of the special-needs children who require services costing $20,000 or more. He said the fact that half of the students would be selected on a first-come, first-serve basis, indicates \u201ca group of parents wants to send their children to private schools at the public\u2019s expense.\u201d\n\nbobby.harrison@journalinc.com\n\nTwitter: @BobbyHarrison9", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By Bobby Harrison Daily Journal Jackson Bureau JACKSON \u2013 The Mississippi Department of Education says more than 250 scholarships or vouchers remain available for special-needs children to use to pursue private education options.
