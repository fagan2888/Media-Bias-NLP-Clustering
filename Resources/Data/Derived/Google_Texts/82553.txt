Portland Commissioner Steve Novick and conservative radio host Lars Larson endured a tandem dousing Thursday for a good cause, the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge. Before getting wet, Novick challenged me to follow suit. The Oregonian's Andrew Theen has a post, including video, here.

On this one occasion, anyway, I was more than happy to take Novick's suggestion. Rather than tracking down a bucket and some ice cubes, I used Tumalo Creek in Bend's Shevlin Park Sunday morning. The water was a chilly 48 degrees. You can watch the video above.

I challenged people on opposite sides of the marijuana legalization debate, Clatsop County District Attorney Joshua Marquis and New Approach Oregon's Anthony Johnson.

Oh, and I'll make a donation to the ALS Association as well.
