United Airlines may be cutting 2,000 airport jobs across the U.S., according to USA TODAY. The airline is considering hiring a contractor to fill roles in departments like bag handling and customer service to cut costs so that their airfare prices stay competitive, according to United spokesman Luke Punzenberger.

The airline met with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents the workers, to discuss the changes and it must have been messy. A few days later United turned around saying they will also bring back some jobs that had been previously outsourced, probably so that they don’t royally screw everyone over. Sounds fair, and the union seemed to agree.

According to the current plan, United will be outsourcing jobs at 28 airports and “insourcing” at nine.
