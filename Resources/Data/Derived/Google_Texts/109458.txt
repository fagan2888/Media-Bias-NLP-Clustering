MONTEREY -- A police officer used a stun gun on a 14-year-old girl when she attacked another officer who was trying to subdue her friend late Saturday at the Monterey County Fair, according to police.

About 9:30 p.m. after receiving reports of the girls fighting, officers used a Taser on one of the girls, Monterey police Lt. Leslie Sonné said Monday.

The girls' names were not released because they are minors.

The officers were trying to detain the girls to question them about a fight, Sonné said, although the girls were not fighting at the time police approached them.

While trying to detain the 14-year-old girl, a 16-year-old began pushing the officer away and took a fighting stance, Sonné said. The officer pulled out his electronic gun, more commonly known as Taser, and ordered the 16-year-old to the ground.

His partner was able to bring her to the ground, but then the younger girl jumped on his back, apparently to try to free her friend, Sonné said. It was then when an officer discharged his Taser ﻿to stop the attack on the officer, Sonné said.

"We're still trying to get the final report from the officer," she said. "One of the girls may have been trying to bite the officer."

Sonné said she did not know if the girls were friends. They are from the local area, but Sonné is not disclosing their cities of residence. It's unclear if the girls were attending the fair with their families or just other friends.

It is rare that Monterey police officers discharge their Tasers. Sonné said she can't remember the last time an officer used one.

Sonné said there will be an investigation on the use of force that will be followed up the chain of command, as is the case in all the instances when there is use of force.

The two girls were taken into custody at Monterey County Juvenile Hall, charged with battery on a police officer and resisting arrest. They were released to their families.
