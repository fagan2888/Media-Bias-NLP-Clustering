Ted Cruz, CBS2\u2019s Marcia Kramer reported.\n\n\u201cIf @TedCruz doesn\u2019t clean up his act, stop cheating, & doing negative ads, I have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nIf @TedCruz doesn\u2019t clean up his act, stop cheating, & doing negative ads, I have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2016\n\nTrump revived a charge he made earlier in the campaign that Cruz is ineligible to be president because he was born in Canada. Cruz says he is eligible because his mother was a U.S. citizen at the time of his birth.\n\nOn Friday, Cruz was just intent on piling up votes.\n\n\u201cThe men and women in this room have the ability to change the outcome of the South Carolina primary,\u201d he said during a campaign stop.\n\nOther Republicans, meanwhile, concentrated their firepower on Trump.\n\n\u201cNegotiating a hotel deal in another country is not foreign policy experience,\u201d said Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush described Trump as \u201ca entertainer, a guy who\u2019s a reality-TV star, who has been successful in his own life but he also pushes people down to make himself look better.\u201d\n\nIn the Democratic contest, both Hillary Rodham Clinton and Bernie Sanders are trying to send a message to African-American voters, who make up a large percentage of the South Carolina electorate, that they are the rightful heir to President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cSadly in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American,\u201d Sanders said during Thursday night\u2019s debate.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act has helped more African-Americans than any other group,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nBoth Democrats are embarking on a big media war in key states.\n\nTeam Clinton has reserved air time in 17 states beyond the next two contests in South Carolina and Nevada. She\u2019s going to spend $27.7 million, just shy of the $28.4 million Sanders will concentrate in just six states.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Friday, he pulled, well, a \u201cDonald Trump,\u201d which naturally began with a tweet that was not so sweet aimed at Texas Sen.
