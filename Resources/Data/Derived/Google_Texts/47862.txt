A woman whose young son was killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting and Sen. Richard Blumenthal are cheering passage in the U.S. Senate of legislation that would boost training of teachers in social and emotional learning.

A bill named for six-year-old shooting victim Jesse Lewis was introduced earlier this year to dedicate money for special training for teachers.

Blumenthal's office said a similar measure was included in the Every Child Achieves Act approved by the Senate this week. He said the measure would allow funds to be used to help educators teach "nonacademic skills" and help children learn how to manage emotions, maintain positive relationships and demonstrate caring and concern for others.

Jesse's mother, Scarlett Lewis, has created a foundation in her son's name promoting peaceful and positive interaction.
