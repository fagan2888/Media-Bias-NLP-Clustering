So why fuss over a handful of new clinics?\n\nBecause unlike those retail clinics -- which Wal-Mart hosts through leases with local hospitals, resulting inmixed success -- these new clinics are fully owned by the company and branded explicitly as one-stop shops for primary care.\n\nBecause the clinics will be open longer and later than competitors: 12 hours per day during the week and another 8-plus hours per day on weekends.\n\nAnd because of the company's size and scale: Wal-Mart's potential as a disruptive innovator in healthcare is essentially peerless.\n\nThe company's move comes at an ideal time to capture consumers: Millions of Americans are getting insurance coverage through Obamacare, and seeking new, convenient sources of care. Wal-Mart's stressed that its clinics will be a low-cost alternative to traditional options: Walk-in visits will cost just $40.\n\nAnd for the hundreds of thousands of Wal-Mart employees covered by the company health plan, well, it's even cheaper.\n\n\"For our associates and dependents on the health plan, you can come and see a provider in the Wal-Mart Care Clinic for $4. Four dollars!\" Jennifer LaPerre, a company official, said last week. \"That is setting a new retail price in the health care industry,\" she added.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After years of 'Will they or won\u2019t they?' discussion, Wal-Mart is making its long-awaited move into delivering primary care: The retailer has quietly opened half a dozen primary care clinics across South Carolina and Texas and plans to launch six more before January.", "language": "english", "author": "WITN", "og": {"url": "http://www.witn.com/home/headlines/Wal-Mart-Wants-To-Be-Your-Doctor-270575991.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/504*315/Walmart88.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "After years of 'Will they or won\u2019t they?' discussion, Wal-Mart is making its long-awaited move into delivering primary care: The retailer has quietly opened half a dozen primary care clinics across South Carolina and Texas and plans to launch six more before January.", "title": "Wal-Mart Wants To Be Your Doctor"}, "twitter": {"description": "After years of 'Will they or won\u2019t they?' discussion, Wal-Mart is making its long-awaited move into delivering primary care: The retailer has quietly opened half a dozen primary care clinics across South Carolina and Texas and plans to launch six more before January.", "title": "Wal-Mart Wants To Be Your Doctor", "url": "http://www.witn.com/home/headlines/Wal-Mart-Wants-To-Be-Your-Doctor-270575991.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/504*315/Walmart88.jpg", "creator": "@WITN", "site": "@WITN", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Wal-Mart Wants To Be Your Doctor", "fb": {"app_id": 100653909772, "pages": 45809529741}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "SAIlGc4W5cz6VdYh4YTfTRgDO0fVlzEwt0FUQF1Qp3g", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "WalMart Wants To Be Your"}, "article_summary": "And for the hundreds of thousands of Wal-Mart employees covered by the company health plan, well, it's even cheaper.\n\"For our associates and dependents on the health plan, you can come and see a provider in the Wal-Mart Care Clinic for $4.\ndiscussion, Wal-Mart is making its long-awaited move into delivering primary care: The retailer has quietly opened half a dozen primary care clinics across South Carolina and Texas and plans to launch six more before January.\nWal-Mart watchers know the company already has more than 100 \"retail clinics\" across its stores, a strategy it's pursued for years.\n\"That is setting a new retail price in the health care industry,\" she added."}
