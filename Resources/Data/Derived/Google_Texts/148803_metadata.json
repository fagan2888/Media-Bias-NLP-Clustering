In the three years since Sandy Hook, Congress has repeatedly deadlocked on the issue. Obama\u2019s proposed changes fall far short of what was proposed in the legislature, and is generally limited to clarifying and enforcing existing law \u2014 with one exception.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s overview the changes. Obama intends to close the background check loophole that allows online sales and gun show sales to proceed without requiring a background check, as well as to overhaul the background check system used by the FBI. The current system has proven woefully inadequate at preventing shooters with documented mental health problems from buying firearms; The New York Times reports that the shooters in eight of the past 15 mass shootings had documented mental health issues that did not appear on background checks.\n\nImproving and overhauling background checks takes additional manpower. As part of this initiative, Obama wants to hire an additional 200 agents for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. He also called for a reduction in the barriers that keep important information about mental health isolated between states, and promised an additional $500 million in federal funding for treatment of mental health issues.\n\nFinally \u2014 and this is new \u2014 Obama ordered the DOD, DOJ, and Homeland Security \u201cto conduct or sponsor research into gun safety technology\u201d that would cut down on the number of negligent, accidental, and unauthorized discharges of firearms in the United States.\n\nCan better tech create safer weapons?\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at this last point. A so-called \u201csmart gun\u201d is a firearm that includes an authentication system that only fires when its owner (or another, authorized user) allows it to do so. The concept dates back decades \u2014 one system, Magna-Trigger, first came to market in 1975 and is still sold today. Magna-Trigger only works with a handful of revolvers, but places a magnet inside the weapon that prevents it from being fired unless the operator is wearing a matching ring. Most publications cite it as the only \u201csmart\u201d technology that ever shipped.\n\nIn theory, the field should be wide open for better, more flexible alternatives. There are a number of easy, low-range networking options that can be used to link a firearm to an authentication token, fingerprint scanners are cheap, and RFID is an established technology. A quick survey of the market shows a number of devices are in development, including projects that rely on all these methods. Some companies are even working on systems that could be retrofitted to existing hardware, thereby addressing the concerns of gun owners who might genuinely prefer such options but don\u2019t want to buy expensive new firearms.\n\nWhat\u2019s less clear is whether or not these systems can be made sufficiently flexible and affordable to interest gun owners. None of the \u201csmart\u201d weapons we\u2019ve seen in-market to-date have been inexpensive \u2014 certainly not as inexpensive as a gun safe and reliable lock. Unless the government wants to wait decades for smart gun technology to make a difference in accidental shooting rates, owners need kits that can be easily retrofitted to existing devices without compromising their functionality \u2014 and these kits need to be extremely secure, while remaining easy to configure. Any designer of a smart gun kit has to allow for the fact that some users will rely on the fact that the weapon is supposedly secure, and will therefore be more prone to leaving a firearm lying about than they might be otherwise.\n\nTo date, the handful of solutions on the market, like the Armatix iP1, have not reviewed particularly well, although the only significant review appears to have been written by a publication of the NRA, which opposes smart guns on principle. It\u2019s true that the United States government, as the largest purchaser of firearms in the US, could spur new innovation and research on safety technologies. But firearms are generally valued because they offer simple, straightforward operation.\n\nThe DOJ, DOD, and FBI have been ordered to submit reports by April that detail the real-world deployment of smart gun technologies, according to the Army Times, and presumably include recommendations on which of the various authentication technologies to back. This will be a long-term project if anything comes of it. But we\u2019ll be curious to see if the concerted backing of the US government can spur gun manufacturers to field results more practical than what we\u2019ve seen to-date.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama has ordered multiple departments of the government to evaluate and recommend so-called", "og": {"url": "http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/220451-obama-orders-dod-doj-and-homeland-security-to-research-smart-guns", "image": "http://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Obama1.jpg", "site_name": "ExtremeTech", "description": "President Obama has ordered multiple departments of the government to evaluate and recommend so-called", "title": "Obama orders DOD, DOJ, and Homeland Security to research smart guns | ExtremeTech"}, "twitter": {"domain": "extremetech.com", "description": "President Obama has ordered multiple departments of the government to evaluate and recommend so-called", "title": "Obama orders DOD, DOJ, and Homeland Security to research smart guns | ExtremeTech", "url": "http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/220451-obama-orders-dod-doj-and-homeland-security-to-research-smart-guns", "image": {"src": "http://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Obama1.jpg"}, "creator": "@ExtremeTech", "site": "ExtremeTech", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#3e3e3e", "zd_ptax": "15769,3749,238,15770,7854,9164,7446,15771,15772,7448,15768,314,62,12361", "zd_ptax_version": "ExtremeTechV1", "server_date": "2016-05-26 6:22:30 pm", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/themes/extremetech/mstile-144x144.png", "live_date": "2016-01-06", "google-site-verification": "bEUo8mwD12wASfxFwnzOt0RKFmEHsxzvy7s5itRySdQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "zdid": 220451}, "article_summary": "He also called for a reduction in the barriers that keep important information about mental health isolated between states, and promised an additional $500 million in federal funding for treatment of mental health issues.\nMost publications cite it as the only \u201csmart\u201d technology that ever shipped.\nThe DOJ, DOD, and FBI have been ordered to submit reports by April that detail the real-world deployment of smart gun technologies, according to the Army Times, and presumably include recommendations on which of the various authentication technologies to back.\nA so-called \u201csmart gun\u201d is a firearm that includes an authentication system that only fires when its owner (or another, authorized user) allows it to do so.\nAs part of this initiative, Obama wants to hire an additional 200 agents for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms."}
