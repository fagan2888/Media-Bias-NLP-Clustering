However, the pending implementation of \u201cObamaCare\u201d (better called after October 1: \u201cDemoCare\u201d) is an immediate and acute threat to Liberty, and Republicans should do everything in their power to thwart that implementation.\n\nAs you recall, ObamaCare was rushed through the Democrat-controlled House and Senate before anyone knew what was in the 2,700 page bill \u2013 which has now grown to require more than seven feet of shelf space. (\u201cWe have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.\u201d \u2013Then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi) The measure passed in the Senate on a party line vote in 2009, while passing in the House by a narrow vote \u2013 219\u2013212 with 34 Democrats and all 178 Republicans voting against it. It was ceremonially signed into law by its namesake immediately after the House vote in March of 2010, prompting Joe Biden to proclaim, \u201cThis is a big f\u2014\u2014 deal.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Obama\u2019s plan to nationalize health care is near the top of the Left\u2019s most coveted political prizes \u2013 second only to the \u201ccrown jewel\u201d of socialism, the centralized control of worldview indoctrination through government \u201cpublic education\u201d institutions \u2013 and Demos have made great strides toward achieving that goal. (\u201cGive me four years to teach the children and the seed I have sown will never be uprooted.\u201d \u2013Vladimir Ilyich Lenin)\n\nObama says he will veto any bill which defunds or amends DemoCare, and that he will not negotiate anything as part of a debt ceiling agreement. Demo Majority Leader Harry Reid says, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to bow to tea-party anarchists who deny the mere fact that Obamacare is the law. We will not bow to tea-party anarchists who refuse to accept that the Supreme Court ruled that Obamacare is constitutional.\u201d In effect, the Senate will provide Obama political cover through this debate.\n\nDespite all the Leftist rhetoric about this massive socialist boondoggle being \u201cthe law which must now be funded,\u201d it was wholly rejected by Republicans in the Senate and House, along with many House Democrats. Thus, proposals to defund it, delay it or amend it are exactly in line with what our Founder\u2019s expected legislators to do in the interest of defending and sustaining Rule of Law.\n\nAfter 41 previous attempts to delay or amend this behemoth, House Republicans have attached a \u201cdefund\u201d DemoCare amendment to its Continuing Resolution legislation, CR being that \u201cpass the buck\u201d gimmick to fund government without actually passing a budget \u2013 which has not been done since George Bush\u2019s last year in office. Using the CR to make their case against nationalized healthcare, effectively elevated conservative Republican objections above the political din.\n\nHere is the House and Senate Republican strategy and endgame (yes, there is one, even if GOP \u201cleadership\u201d is trying to catch up with the rank and file). There is a growing grassroots storm brewing in opposition to socialized medicine, now that the reality and consequences of ObamaCare are starting to sink in. The House is using the CR as a vehicle to force Democrat votes on defunding, delaying or amending this job-killing budget-buster. The DemoCare dare is really a strategic long shot effort to delay implementation of the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d until after the 2014 election when Republicans believe they will have generated enough political opposition to significantly modify major portions of the law. Indeed, Obama has, for political expediency, already unilaterally (and unconstitutionally) delayed implementation of the employer mandate.\n\nKnowing the House \u201cdefund tactic\u201d won\u2019t pass a full vote in the Demo-controlled Senate, as Republican Sen. Ted Cruz made plain prior to the House legislation even making it to the Senate, this strategy assumes that Demo Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid will strip out that measure and send it back to the House. The next step will be for House Republicans to return a CR replacing the word \u201cdefund\u201d with \u201cdelay,\u201d which is also likely to fail. As a third pass, I think the House should return a \u201cclean CR\u201d with an amendment to prohibit any congressional subsidies for healthcare (after Obama unconstitutionally did an end run around the Vitter amendment), and demand Executive Branch employees also be subject to all provisions of the ObamaCare mandates \u2013 both measures with enormous popular support. That notwithstanding, the measures might still stall in the Senate, where Democrats would like to run the clock down and force a \u201cgovernment shutdown,\u201d which they and their Leftmedia advocates will effectively blame on Republicans.\n\nIf Demo Senators reject all of the above, then the House should, in the stated interest not shutting down government, acquiesce, and let the ObamaCare mandates go into effect as scheduled. But that does not mean the strategy is a failure \u2013 quite the contrary. Republicans will have gained enormous momentum ahead of 2014. The net effect of the Republican strategy is that Democrats in the House and Senate were forced to vote on the defund and delay measures, and will have to defend those votes ahead of the midterm elections. In regard to the measure to \u201cdelay\u201d the implementation of ObamaCare, Demo votes against that \u201cRepublican compromise\u201d will be judged harshly in states and districts with only modest support for ObamaCare, amid growing grassroots protests against Obama\u2019s socialized medicine scheme.\n\nWhat will drive those grassroots protests?\n\nObama, the consummate narcissist, having himself even embraced the name \u201cObamaCare,\u201d will himself, along with every member of the House and Senate with a \u201cD\u201d after their name, suffer a reversal of political fortunes after ObamaCare is implemented. Why? Because ObamaCare has high negatives in public opinion polls, and from October 01 forward, every American of every political stripe who has any issue with health care, whether a hangnail or heart transplant, a delay in a doctor\u2019s office or in critical care for a loved one, will tie blame for their discontent like a noose around the necks of Obama and his Democrats, who were solely responsible for forcing this abomination upon the American people. Additionally, dealing with government clerical minions in this new bloated bureaucracy will be no different than dealing with any other huge government bureaucracy \u2013 endless without resolution. No matter how Fab-Tastic ObamaCare may be for some Demo constituencies, Democrats are going to be the target of every health care complaint.\n\nIndeed, when your adversary is self destructing, don\u2019t interfere!\n\nEven Demo National Committee chair, Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, can see that pitfall from her perspective in the House. She is insisting that Democrats \u201cmust not treat every minute provision in the law as sacred.\u201d She added that Demos \u201cshould be open to suggestions for improving the law.\u201d\n\nI would add that, beyond the high ObamaCare negatives among consumers in general, the number of Obama\u2019s previously-loyal adherents who are tired of his incessant, arrogant and spiteful rhetoric, is growing.\n\nIf Republicans successfully herd the inevitable healthcare consumer dissatisfaction and anger toward Democrats, the electoral awards will be substantial in 2014, 2016 and beyond. Of course, given that establishment Republican have a propensity for snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, that\u2019s a big \u201cif.\u201d Republicans should heed the old adage: When your adversary is defeating himself, don\u2019t interfere.\n\nIn mid October, the Republican House will follow the CR, with amendments to the Debt Ceiling proposal (which we hit sometime between 17 and 22 October) \u2013 a \u201cwish list\u201d of other amendments, including tax reform, approval of the Keystone pipeline, regulatory and entitlement reforms including means-tested Medicare, and a \u201cchained\u201d Consumer Price Index (CPI). But that is the next budget battle.\n\nAnd Obama has provided Republicans plenty of fodder for that debate, most notably his recent assertion: \u201cNow, this debt ceiling \u2013 I just want to remind people in case you haven\u2019t been keeping up \u2013 raising the debt ceiling \u2026 does not increase our debt; it does not somehow promote profligacy. All it does is it says you got to pay the bills that you\u2019ve already racked up, Congress. \u2026 It\u2019s always a tough vote because the average person thinks raising the debt ceiling must mean that we\u2019re running up our debt, so people don\u2019t like to vote on it, and, typically, there\u2019s some gamesmanship in terms of making the president\u2019s party shoulder the burden of raising the \u2013 taking the vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cPay the bills that you\u2019ve already racked up, Congress\u201d? Apparently Obama\u2019s trillion dollar \u201ceconomic stimulus program\u201d FAIL is just something Congress \u201cracked up.\u201d This from the biggest spender and political gamesman in U.S. history.\n\nTaking a walk down memory lane, I recall Obama waxing long on the Republican-controlled Senate floor in March of 2006, about President Bush\u2019s request to raise the debt ceiling: \u201cThe fact that we are here today to debate raising America\u2019s debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the U.S. government can\u2019t pay its own bills. It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our government\u2019s reckless fiscal policies. \u2026 Increasing America\u2019s debt weakens us domestically and internationally. Leadership means that \u2018the buck stops here.\u2019 Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better.\u201d\n\nAnd then there was that \u201cirresponsible\u201d and \u201cunpatriotic\u201d presidential campaign speech in July of 2008: \u201cThe problem is, is that the way Bush has done it over the last eight years is to take out a credit card from the Bank of China in the name of our children, driving up our national debt from $5 trillion for the first 42 presidents \u2013 No. 43 added $4 trillion by his lonesome, so that we now have over $9 trillion of debt that we are going to have to pay back \u2013 $30,000 for every man, woman and child. That\u2019s irresponsible. It\u2019s unpatriotic.\u201d\n\nFact Check: Over the 8 years George Bush was in office, our national debt increased by $4.9 trillion, due primarily to the economic consequences of 9/11 and funding two major warfronts in response. In the five years since Obama took office, his faux \u201ceconomic recovery plan\u201d has increased the national debt load by $6.1 trillion. Yes, No. 44 added $6.1 trillion \u201cby his lonesome,\u201d so that we now have over $16.7 trillion of debt that we are going to have to pay back \u2013 more than $54,000 for every man, woman, and child. That\u2019s irresponsible. It\u2019s unpatriotic.\n\nAs a place marker on ObamaCare\u2019s threat to Liberty and free enterprise, what follows is a brief analysis of the Left\u2019s endeavor to nationalize healthcare.\n\nThe \u201cPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act,\u201d which accomplished neither patient protection nor cost reductions, is now ubiquitously called \u201cObamaCare,\u201d but perhaps more aptly should be called ObamaCareless.\u201c The original stated rationale was to \"control health care costs\u201d and \u201cprovide insurance coverage for the uninsured,\u201d approximately 15% of Americans with no medical coverage \u2013 which is not to say no medical care.\n\nOf course, the real rationale for ObamaCare is to create subsidies in order to create dependencies in order to create constituencies, the Left\u2019s template for political perpetuation. O'Care accomplishes this by implementing a scheme that will ultimately give the central government authoritarian regulatory control over more than 20% of the U.S. economy. This is in keeping with the philosophy of Obama and his NeoCom cadres of statists on the Left have effectively hijacked the once-noble Democrat Party and converted it into their own socialist party tool in their ongoing effort to pull the plug on our Constitution.\n\nUltimately, the objective of ObamaCare is to implement a massive single-payer system, in effect, placing the management and rationing of health care services under the thumb of a bloated and inefficient central government, with the objective of using that \u201cachievement\u201d as a major political stepping stone to implement a much broader socialist agenda in the coming years.\n\nOur nation is about to take a great leap in that direction, with devastating consequences. Ronald Reagan, in a now-famous 1961 radio address, warned, \u201cOne of the traditional methods of imposing statism or socialism on a people has been by way of medicine. It is very easy to describe a medical program as a humanitarian project\u2026 Most people are reluctant to oppose anything that suggests medical care for people.\u201d\n\nAs Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid surmised earlier this summer, \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done with ObamaCare is a step in the right direction, but we\u2019re far from having something that\u2019s going to work forever. \u2026 We had a real good run at the public option \u2026 don\u2019t think we didn\u2019t have a tremendous number of people who wanted a single-payer system.\u201d When asked if he really meant to say \u201csingle payer,\u201d Reid responded, \u201cYes, yes. Absolutely, yes!\u201d\n\nIndeed, Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of the grossly misnamed \u201cHealth and Human Services\u201d bureaucracy, infamously proclaimed during Obama\u2019s first presidential campaign, \u201cI\u2019m all for a single-payer system eventually.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Obama was clear in his objective to nationalize health care: \u201cI happen to be a proponent of a single-payer universal health care program. I see no reason why the United States of America, the wealthiest country in the history of the world, spending 14% of its gross national product on health care, cannot provide basic health insurance to everybody.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Obama\u2019s objective is to convert the U.S. into a Euro-style socialist state. Were he to look across The Pond, however, he would notice that the UK is now moving to privatize its National Health Service in order to avoid the fate of other EuroUnion states teetering on the verge of bankruptcy.\n\nRecall, if you will, the inimitable words of Winston Churchill: \u201cSocialism is a philosophy of failure, the creed of ignorance, and the gospel of envy, its inherent virtue is the equal sharing of misery.\u201d More recently, former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher aptly noted, \u201cSocialist governments \u2026 always run out of other people\u2019s money. They then start to nationalize everything.\u201d\n\nSound familiar?\n\nMoreover, Germany Christian Democrat Party candidate Angela Merkel, won reelection for implementing austerity measures, which have left Germany, Europe\u2019s largest economy, with the lowest unemployment rate in almost two-decades, and the virtual elimination of the nation\u2019s budget deficit.\n\nHowever, American Democrats are not so smart. Obama stepped up the Demo-goguery in support of nationalized healthcare this week: \u201cRepublicans in Congress don\u2019t seem to be focused on how to grow the economy and build the middle class. \u2026 [A]re some of these folks really so beholden to one extreme wing of their party they\u2019re willing to tank the entire economy just because they can\u2019t get their way on this issue?\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina Rep. Joe Wilson had it right back in 2009, when he interrupted Obama\u2019s introduction of his nationalizing health care plan to a joint session of Congress: \u201cYou Lie! You LIE!\u201d I second that motion, without apology, and have found that it is applicable to just about anything Obama says.\n\nOf course, Republicans are endeavoring to \u201cgrow the economy and build the middle class\u201d as Obama takes the nation down the debt death spiral.\n\nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, Obama\u2019s plan to continue mounting debt on future generations is unsustainable, and that debt load is exacerbated by the rising costs of ObamaCare.\n\nAs the number of major corporations opting out of ObamaCare grows, and as states and individuals start calculating the enormous cost of the exchange programs, and as even Obama\u2019s most ardent supporters \u2013 unions \u2013 abandon his socialist scheme to nationalize health care, Obama defiantly claims, \u201cA lot of the, you know, horror stories that were predicted about how this was gonna shoot rates way up and there were gonna be death panels and all that stuff, none of that stuff\u2019s happened. And in two weeks, the Affordable Care Act is gonna help millions of more people. And there\u2019s no serious evidence that the law, which has helped to keep down the rise in health care costs to their lowest level in 50 years, is holding back economic growth. All of the horror stories that were talked about have not come true.\u201d\n\nNot YET! In the words of P.J. O'Rourke, \u201cIf you think health care is expensive now, wait until you see what it costs when it\u2019s free.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimate conservatively, that the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d will increase national health spending $621 billion over the next 10 years.\n\nEven the liberal editors of Obama\u2019s hometown paper, the Chicago Tribune, opined, \u201cLet\u2019s delay and rewrite this ill-conceived law. Congress need not start from scratch. Lawmakers can build on what all of us have learned from three years of painful trial and error. Three years of attempting, but failing, to make this clumsy monstrosity work for the American people.\u201d\n\nObama blames the fracturing of his ObamaCare coalition on propaganda: \u201cThe problem we have is that over the last four years billions of dollars have been spent misinforming people about what this law is about. All of the horror stories that were talked about have not come true.\u201d\n\nBut in fact it\u2019s the Left\u2019s dezinformatsia propaganda machine that has spent billions \u201cmisinforming people.\u201d And that was before the bludgeoning from a $700 million taxpayer-funded ObamaCare marketing blitz, funneled primarily to Demo friendly ad agencies and media outlets.\n\nObamaCare also gives the government strong-arm capabilities associated with communist dictatorships. Most notably, Sarah Hall Ingram, who served as commissioner of the IRS office responsible for targeting Obama\u2019s \u201cenemies list\u201d in 2012, is now in charge of the IRS office enforcing ObamaCare mandates. This greatly expands the opportunity to target a much broader \u201cenemies list\u201d with a wide range of tax and regulatory compliance mandates.\n\nIngram and her cronies have at their disposal an unprecedented amount of personal information centralized under the ObamaCare Data Hub, a compilation database of all manner of information on every American, ostensibly to determine eligibility for subsidized insurance.\n\nWith the brewing political battle over the budget deficits and implementation delays as a backdrop, here is the shortlist of ObamaCare bullet points from our previous analysis on this socialist behemoth:\n\n\u201cNo matter how we reform health care, we will keep this promise to the American people: If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor. Period. If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan. Period. No one will take it away. No matter what. My view is that health-care reform should be guided by a simple principle: Fix what\u2019s broken and build on what works.\u201d\n\nTens of millions of Americans are going to get cancelation notices on their private insurance plans, and despite Obama\u2019s assertions to the contrary, he knows the cancelations are coming.\n\nSuspension of employer mandate \u2013 Obama unilaterally suspended application of the employer mandate portion of the law. This is a clear violation of constitutional authority. Obama has stepped over the Constitution, as he frequently does, to pick and choose which laws or portions of laws he enforces without consultation with Congress. It also throws the law off balance, because it allows employers to skip their obligations but leaves individual consumers and employees beholden to the law.\n\nCongressional Exemption \u2013 The Office of Personnel Management quietly issued a blanket exception that allowed Congress and congressional staffers to continue to receive their generous health benefits rather than having to enroll in ObamaCare. Louisiana Sen. David Vitter has introduced legislation to reverse the OPM exemption and end the subsidy, as required by the 1995 Congressional Accountability Act, one of Newt Gingrich\u2019s Contract With America provisions. Of course, Congress continues to exempt itself from most mandates and regulations it imposes on the rest of the nation.\n\nPolitical Exemptions \u2013 HHS has issued exemptions to hundreds of employers, nonprofit groups, and union organizations for delaying their entry into ObamaCare. The reasons for the exemptions are because these groups will lose employees, money, or members by taking part in the law as it is currently designed. However, the exemptions have been either arbitrary or directly linked to organizations that have publicly supported the law or Obama and Democratic elected officials.\n\nSubsidies \u2013 HHS lifted all restrictions for people applying for subsidies to pay for federally approved health benefits. These millions of people will therefore be on the honor system in reporting their income or whether they are already receiving assistance from an employer or other federal entitlement \u2013 a clear invitation to mass-scale fraud.\n\nInsurance premium increases \u2013 ObamaCare claims that premiums will not go up. Indiana is predicting a 72% hike; Ohio is predicting an 88% hike. Florida and California project even greater devastating increases.\n\nInsurance coverage changes \u2013 A July Wall Street Journal analysis revealed that few of the low-rate insurance policies that healthy people now purchase will be available once the law is fully implemented. Individuals will be forced to pay more regardless of their need for coverage.\n\nCalifornia insurance companies opting out \u2013 In the nation\u2019s most populous state, Anthem Blue Cross is opting out of covering small businesses. UnitedHealth and Aetna are opting out of individual consumer insurance pools. This severely threatens the viability of the insurance exchange in the state.\n\nDoctors opting out \u2013 The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced in August that the number of doctors opting out of seeing Medicaid patients has tripled in the last three years. Doctors are also limiting the number of Medicare patients they treat, and fewer doctors are taking on new Medicaid patients.\n\nImplementation Delays \u2013 During the last week of August 2013, HHS delayed signing agreements with insurance companies that would sell plans on the federal exchanges beginning October 1. One reason was the technical difficulties in coordinating the display of information on federal websites.\n\nObamaCare Speak \u2013 The IRS rules defining minimum essential coverage do not mention the word \u201ctax\u201d in explaining the penalty for not meeting minimum coverage standards. Instead, the new phrase is \u201cshared responsibility payment.\u201d\n\nPower of the Exchanges \u2013 Federal and state bureaucrats will have the power to arbitrarily bar from taking part in the insurance exchanges any physician or health care services that don\u2019t meet certain standards. Standards, by the way, are being set by an unnamed and unaccountable panel of experts appointed by the government \u2013 in other words, death panels. States and the federal government will also be able to bar the sale of insurance to individuals and small businesses outside the exchanges.\n\nSeeking Donations from the Private Sector \u2013 This past spring, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius privately reached out to numerous health industry officials, businesses and charitable groups, asking them to provide material or financial donations to aid the implementation of ObamaCare. She wrote letters or made phone calls to private groups, church organizations, and health industry executives. The presumption was that larger organizations were expected to contribute more.\n\n\u201cBending the Cost Curve\u201d \u2013 ObamaCare was supposed to bend the cost curve down. But a May report by the House Energy and Commerce Committee compiled from 17 of the country\u2019s largest insurance companies stated that insurance premiums will rise 100% on average, and in some cases as high as 400%. Small businesses will see hikes of 50% to 100%.\n\nEmployers trimming coverage \u2013 Insurance brokers are now designing and packaging bare-bones plans that employers can offer to their employees in order to cut costs. The plans are modeled after traditional catastrophic care plans that offer coverage for only certain circumstances. These plans will remain within the realm of the law because the level of employer-sponsored coverage was never specified.\n\nThe Demo strategic solution to ObamaCare sticker shock and employers moving full time employees to part-time in order to remain solvent. They will just raise the subsidies to make insurance \u201cmore fair.\u201d They will lower the bar on what constitutes part-time employment. However, let me reiterate: From October 1 forward, Americans of every political stripe who have any issue with health care will tie blame for their discontent like a noose around the necks of Obama and his Democrats, who enacted it, and more recently refused to defund or delay it.\n\nUntil a majority of \u201cwe, the people\u201d are ready and willing to throw off this tyrannical burden, we will suffer the consequences. As 18th century philosopher Joseph de Maistre wrote, \u201cEvery nation gets the government it deserves.\u201d Maybe the 2014 elections will provide that majority.\n\nIn 1816, Thomas Jefferson provided the words that should form the rallying cry for every conservative candidate on the 2014 ballot: \u201cWe must make our election between economy and Liberty, or profusion and servitude.\u201d\n\nFootnote: According to analysis by the Wall Street Journal, when Sen. Ted Cruz unwittingly derailed the conservative House CR strategy, he may have boosted his political capital, but the shutdown is taking a heavy toll on House Republicans. The Journal notes the shutdown eclipsed Obama\u2019s IRS, Benghazi and Syrian scandals, and now has Republicans on the run. For example, in July, Republicans had a 12-point lead with independents. Now Demos lead by nine. And GOP\u2019s favorability rating has dropped by 10 points to 28%. Alexander questioned Cruz\u2019s tactics in \u201cCruz\u2019s Box Canyon.\u201d He does not question Cruz\u2019s motives, but believes his tactics were wrong, and the resulting Republican infighting is self defeating.\n\nPro Deo et Constitutione \u2013 Libertas aut Mors\n\nSemper Fortis Vigilate Paratus et Fidelis", "article_metadata": {"description": "Demo's perfect storm ensures extended economic stagnation and threatens American Liberty.", "csrf-token": "B1btMX0MDgtxM6vRycI7PXSBCWiXN3ujKr74OAObD5Q=", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The Patriot Post", "description": "Demo\u2019s perfect storm ensures extended economic stagnation and threatens American Liberty.", "title": "Derailing ObamaCare and DemoDebt", "url": "http://patriotpost.us/alexander/20184", "image": "http://assets.patriotpost.us/images/2013-09-19-489cc142.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002378661032, "app_id": 217327155053459}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc1d1\"", "article_summary": "If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan.\nThe next step will be for House Republicans to return a CR replacing the word \u201cdefund\u201d with \u201cdelay,\u201d which is also likely to fail.\nNo matter how Fab-Tastic ObamaCare may be for some Demo constituencies, Democrats are going to be the target of every health care complaint.\nThe Demo strategic solution to ObamaCare sticker shock and employers moving full time employees to part-time in order to remain solvent.\nDemo Majority Leader Harry Reid says, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to bow to tea-party anarchists who deny the mere fact that Obamacare is the law."}
