Kay Hagan was supposed to be one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats this year but she has managed to consistently lead in the polls, as Republican challenger Thom Tillis struggles to muster the support of tea party voters he needs to win in November.\n\nMrs. Hagan meanwhile is energizing her base by accusing Mr. Tillis, speaker of North Carolina\u2019s House, of being a right-wing extremist who she characterizes as anti-woman and anti-education.\n\n\u201cWhile Kay was named the most moderate member of the Senate Speaker Tillis led a deeply unpopular legislature that cut education spending by $500 million to give tax breaks to the wealthy, killed an equal pay bill, refused to raise the minimum wage and defunded Planned Parenthood,\u201d said Hagan campaign spokesman Chris Hayden.\n\nSEE ALSO: Kay Hagan up 3 points in North Carolina Senate race: poll\n\nFrom his career in corporate America to his support of toll roads to his comment that legal gay marriage is likely inevitable, Mr. Tillis has alienated much of the state\u2019s conservative base, said Thomas Mills, a Democratic political analyst in North Carolina.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re living in a town of 2,000 people in rural North Carolina that\u2019s the base,\u201d he said. \u201cHe culturally can\u2019t connect with those people. He\u2019s not a tea party guy and they never accepted that he is.\u201d\n\nJoe Greene, a leader of the Conservative Patriots Of Wilkes Empowering the Republic, or CPOWER, a tea party group in Wilkes County, agrees.\n\nSEE ALSO: Women voters boost N.C. Sen. Kay Hagan into lead: poll\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an establishment Republican. That\u2019s why I\u2019m opposed to him,\u201d said Mr. Greene. \u201cA lot of people feel the way I do and won\u2019t vote for him. He\u2019s got a lot of things about him that\u2019s not grass roots.\u201d\n\nHe said that unlike many of his tea party compatriots, he would begrudgingly cast his ballot for Mr. Tillis.\n\nAsked if he thought Mr. Tillis would win, Mr. Greene said: \u201cRight now, I kind of doubt it.\u201d\n\nMrs. Hagan has edged out Mr. Tillis in nearly every major poll, albeit usually by a thin margin. She reached the important 50-percent threshold in a Civitas poll this week, topping Mr. Tillis 50 percent to 43 percent.\n\nThe Tillis campaign did not respond to questions about the candidates\u2019 support from tea party and conservative voters.\n\nMr. Tillis\u2018 low poll numbers are a headache for the national Republican Party, which is eyeing North Carolina for a Senate seat pickup. Mrs. Hagan\u2019s seat was considered one of the easier pickups in Republicans\u2019 quest of a net gain of six seats this year to win majority control of the Senate.\n\nDavid Rohde, a political science professor at Duke University in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, said that Mr. Tillis\u2018 role as speaker had put him a political bind similar to that of House Speaker John Boehner, Ohio Republican. Mr. Boehner also gets hit from the right for not being conservative enough and from the left for being extremist.\n\nFittingly, Mr. Boehner this week sent one of his top aides, Michael Steel, a North Carolina native and experienced campaign operative, to help out with GOP campaigns in the Tar Heel State.\n\nThe Duke professor said Mrs. Hagan caught a lucky break when Mr. Tillis won the Republican primary.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019d say Tillis was blowing it, but he\u2019s the reason she\u2019s doing well,\u201d said Mr. Rohde.\n\nMr. Tillis has moved to shore up his conservative base. He brought in tea party favorite Sen. Rand Paul for a campaign event Wednesday.\n\nMr. Paul, a Kentucky Republican who is considering a 2016 presidential run, vouched for Mr. Tillis\u2018 conservative credentials.\n\n\u201cLower taxes, the Constitution, limited government, balanced budget, personal liberties. I think Thom represents those ideas,\u201d he told a crowd at Big Ed\u2019s restaurant in Raleigh, the city\u2019s News & Observer reported.\n\nMr. Tillis has won over some tea party voters, just not enough to boost him in the polls. The worry among Tillis\u2018 supporters is that he\u2019ll have the same problem on Election Day.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s accomplished more for the state of North Carolina than Jesse Helms did,\u201d said Tom Kern, president of the Catawba Valley Tea Party in Hickory, a small city about 50 miles northwest of Charlotte.\n\nMr. Kern said that Mr. Tillis won him over when the two met in person at an event early in the campaign.\n\nThe two sat together on a picnic bench and Mr. Tillis went over this record of conservative accomplishments, including passing voter ID laws, protecting gun rights, restricting abortion and balancing the state budget.\n\nMr. Kern blamed Mr. Tillis\u2018 campaign advisers for sapping tea party support by pushing the candidate to the center in an attempt to peel off Democratic voters from Mrs. Hagan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wrong. He\u2019s got to energize the base,\u201d said Mr. Kern.", "article_metadata": {"description": "North Carolina Sen.
