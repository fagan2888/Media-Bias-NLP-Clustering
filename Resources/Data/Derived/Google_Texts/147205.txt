An East Ridge babysitter has been arrested after police said she broke one child's legs by shaking her.

Police said a second child was injured by similar shaking.

Bridget Sharee (Lamb) Jones, 31, was charged with two counts of aggravated child abuse.

One mother said she picked up her six-month-old daughter from Ms. Jones last Thursday and noticed she appeared sick and fussy and was having trouble bearing weight on her leg.

Police said that mother's sister has a four-month-old daughter, who is also tended by Ms. Jones. She took her daughter to the hospital to be checked out for continued fussiness and after learning of the other injury.

She was told that her daughter had a broken left femur. Her right tibia was broken in two places and her right fibia was broken in one place.

Ms. Jones told police she was in an abusive relationship with her boyfriend and he made her very angry. She said that resulted in her "grabbing each of the two children by the ankles and feet and shaking them hard when they were crying."
