Overall, the caps will range from $150 to $500 and were crafted to help reduce the monthly out-of-pocket costs for enrollees.\n\nThe policy change has cast a spotlight on a deficiency under the Affordable Care Act, health advocates said. While they applaud the now 5-year-old law for making most Americans eligible for health coverage regardless of preexisting conditions, the high cost of drugs keep those who suffer from chronic illnesses from receiving valuable treatment, said Anthony Wright, executive director for Health Access, a California-based consumer advocacy coalition.\n\nCovered California\u2019s policy change will help those who need these medications but who were forced to spend their entire maximum out-of-pocket costs, Wright said.\n\nThe change is not permanent and would be reviewed in a year, nor is it perfect because it excludes some insurance holders, Wright and others said. But it\u2019s a good start, he added.\n\n\u201cThe fact that this has been agreed to in the Covered California realm makes it much more likely that these policies get enacted permanently,\u201d Wright said.\n\nHis group is supporting legislation that is winding its way through Sacramento. Known as AB 339, the proposed law mirrors Covered California\u2019s change, but would place limits on how much health plans can charge enrollees for outpatient prescriptions permanently. It would set a monthly cap of as little as $124, Wright said.\n\n\u201cConsumers are being protected from the most outrageous costs (through Covered California) but still are paying a lot for these drugs,\u201d Wright said. \u201cWe want to make sure these people have access.\u201d\n\nWhile praised for its decision, Covered California\u2019s board was also criticized for not going far enough. California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones said the $500 cap per prescription per month for those who carry a bronze plan was still too high.\n\n\u201cWhile I am pleased that Covered California took our suggestions to cap Silver, Gold and Platinum coverage, I am disappointed that Covered California did not lower the cap amount that health insurers can charge per drug per month for the bronze plans, as we requested,\u201d Jones said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore than 1.3 million Californians have active health insurance through Covered California. Of those, 24 percent have a bronze plan, which is most often purchased by those who consider themselves to be healthy and don\u2019t want to pay a high premium.\n\nLiz Helms, the executive director for California Chronic Care Coalition, agreed with Jones.\n\n\u201cThey can go further,\u201d she said of Covered California\u2019s decision. \u201cThe bronze plan is not a plan for people for chronic conditions. It\u2019s not a good buy. We asked for a cap for $200, but we\u2019re happy we got what we got. For the moment, we know there\u2019s more work to do.\u201d\n\nAlthough some states have passed legislation to cap out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs, Covered California\u2019s decision made it the first exchange in the nation to do so.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time that an exchange has ensured that all of its consumers have access to the medications they need,\u201d Covered California Executive Director Peter Lee said in a statement. \u201cThese new policies strike a balance between ensuring Covered California consumers can afford the medication they need to treat chronic and life-threatening conditions while keeping premiums affordable for all.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new decision by Covered California to adopt a policy that helps customers pay for high-cost speciality drugs sparked hope for an expanded state law that could assist thousands with HIV, diabetes, multiple scle", "title": "Covered California\u2019s prescription drug price cap may open doors for thousands", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailybreeze.com/article/LI/20150524/NEWS/150529709", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.dailybreeze.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LI/20150524/NEWS/150529709/AR/0/AR-150529709.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1001px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Covered California\u2019s prescription drug price cap may open doors for thousands"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailybreeze.com", "description": "A new decision by Covered California to adopt a policy that helps customers pay for high-cost speciality drugs sparked hope for an expanded state law that could assist thousands with HIV, diabetes, multiple scle", "title": "Covered California\u2019s prescription drug price cap may open doors for thousands", "url": "http://www.dailybreeze.com/article/LI/20150524/NEWS/150529709", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailybreeze.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LI/20150524/NEWS/150529709/AR/0/AR-150529709.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@DailyBreezeNews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551753330", "iphone": "id503015160", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.torrancedailybreeze"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Covered California,prescription drug cost, Prescription drug costs", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Covered California,prescription drug cost, Prescription drug costs"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe want to make sure these people have access.\u201dWhile praised for its decision, Covered California\u2019s board was also criticized for not going far enough.\n\u201cThey can go further,\u201d she said of Covered California\u2019s decision.\n\u201cConsumers are being protected from the most outrageous costs (through Covered California) but still are paying a lot for these drugs,\u201d Wright said.\nKnown as AB 339, the proposed law mirrors Covered California\u2019s change, but would place limits on how much health plans can charge enrollees for outpatient prescriptions permanently.\nCovered California\u2019s policy change will help those who need these medications but who were forced to spend their entire maximum out-of-pocket costs, Wright said."}
