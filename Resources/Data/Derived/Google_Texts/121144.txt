NEW YORK (MainStreet) — The Twitter bully @laughinpaulryan, who has been tweeting negative information about marijuana companies and investors, has been positively identified as a 36-year-old New Jersey resident named Norman Gates.

“More cyber harassment of companies is happening online today because bullies think they are acting anonymously,” said Ethan Wall, social media attorney, professor and author of Fire Over Facebook (Association of Corporate Counsel, 2013). “What bullies fail to realize is that it’s easy to prove slander on Twitter where someone made false statements about a third party by counting the number of tweets and taking screenshots.”

A private investigator's report commissioned by Terra Tech found that Gates’s last known address was 222 Arbutus Avenue in Galloway, N.J., which is owned by Melinda Schriver, whose reported sister Alice has been involved in crimes, such as credit card fraud, assault, trespassing, theft, burglary and conspiracy.

Gates allegedly tweeted that a Terra Tech board member was sentenced to jail and wrote disparaging statements about 420 Investor Founder Alan Brochstein, who now has Gates’s twitter handle @LaughinPaulRyan on ignore.

“He does a lot of harassing people who defend Terra Tech on twitter,” said Derek Peterson, CEO with Terra Tech. “When potential investors 'google' Terra Tech, they want negative information to appear, which deters them from looking further into the company. His objective is to impact Google rankings for Terra Tech."

Born May 22, 1978, Gates may have three brothers, and although the report doesn't note whether Gates himself has been arrested, it does state that his assumed older brother Frank has been accused and convicted of multiple drug offenses and possessing a firearm.
