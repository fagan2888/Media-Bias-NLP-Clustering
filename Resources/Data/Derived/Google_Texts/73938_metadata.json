They\u2019ve suggested that children with ADHD have an easier time concentrating when they spend time outdoors. A 2008 study even found that, for office workers, a mere glimpse of green through a window or a live plant on their desk were, on the whole, associated with lower stress levels and higher job satisfaction.\n\nA new study published last week in Environmental Science & Technology underscores just how important green spaces are for our long-term well-being. When a group of researchers from the UK\u2019s University of Exeter looked at five years\u2019 worth of mental health data for 1064 participants who moved their residence during the study period, they found that those who moved to urban areas with more surrounding green space showed higher overall mental health scores\u2014meaning that they were happier and had lower levels of anxiety and depression\u2014for the very first year after their relocation compared to the years prior to moving.\n\nEven more important, they found that these benefits lingered. Participants who\u2019d moved to greener areas showed higher mental health scores for a full three years after their relocation, when the study stopped collecting data.\n\nThe data came from the British Household Panel Survey, a project started by Exeter researchers in 1991 that annually collects information on all sorts of socioeconomic trends from thousands of British households. By parsing the data, the researchers found 594 households that moved to urban areas with more green space, and 470 households that moved into parts of cities with less of it, based on residence addresses collected in the survey and databases of green space in England.\n\nTo guage mental health, the researchers analyzed the answers provided by the people in response to questions like \u201cHow much stress have you felt in the past few weeks compared to usual?\u201d or \u201cHow hard has it been for you to concentrate in the past few weeks compared to usual?\u201d Responses were collected periodically over the next few years.\n\nAfter running statistical regressions to eliminate the influence of confounding factors such as income, employment, education and personality traits, they found that for three full years after their move, people in greener areas showed markedly better mental health scores compared to the two years prior to moving. This is a metric that not only includes stress levels and the ability to concentrate, but also the ability to make good decisions, a person\u2019s level of confidence, overall happiness and other factors.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Studies show that the mental and physiological benefits of greenery are immediate and long-lasting\r\n VIDEO", "author": "Joseph Stromberg", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Studies show that the mental and physiological benefits of greenery are immediate and long-lasting\r\n VIDEO", "title": "Want to improve your health?
