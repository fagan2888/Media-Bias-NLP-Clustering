These are so-called \u201cself-insured\u201d plans in which an employer sets aside its own money to cover most of the expected medical costs of workers. Self-insured employers generally hire an insurance company to administer their benefit plan.\n\nFriday\u2019s HHS rules applies instead to plans that are sold directly by insurance companies to individuals and employers, usually small to mid-sized firms.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\u201cLast summer, the Supreme Court ruled that same-sex spouses are entitled to the same rights and protections as any other couple under federal law. This action by HHS is a significant step forward in ensuring that the benefits of health reform reach all who need them, including same-sex spouses and their families,\u201d said Laura Durso, Director of the LGBT Research and Communication Project at the Center for American Progress\n\nThe guidance strongly encourages insurers to comply with its requirements before the end of the open enrollment period on March 31, although companies have until the beginning of the next plan year \u2014 January 1, 2015 \u2014 to fully bring their policies in line with federal requirements.\n\nIt does not speak to whether family coverage must also be available to domestic partners or people in civil unions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Story Filed Under", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Health and Human Services Department (HHS), Health and Wellness, Healthcare", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "LGBTQ Nation", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama Administration on Friday released new guidance clarifying that the Affordable Care Act prohibits insurers from discriminating against same-sex spouses who wish to purch\u2026", "title": "HHS: Affordable Care Act prohibits discrimination against same-sex couples", "url": "http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2014/03/hhs-affordable-care-act-prohibits-discrimination-against-same-sex-couples/", "image": {"width": 410, "identifier": "http://static.lgbtqnation.com/assets/2013/07/HHS-seal.jpg", "height": 280}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://static.lgbtqnation.com/assets/2013/07/HHS-seal.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 162245191716, "app_id": 139331137822}, "viewport": "width=940", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-14T18:00:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-14T18:26:30+00:00"}, "bitly-verification": "d05cd30d47d0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc5fd\"", "article_summary": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama Administration on Friday released new guidance clarifying that the Affordable Care Act prohibits insurers from discriminating against same-sex spouses who wish to purchase health coverage as a family.\nArticle continues below\u201cLast summer, the Supreme Court ruled that same-sex spouses are entitled to the same rights and protections as any other couple under federal law.\nMany large employer plans are already operating under similar rules issued last fall by the Labor Department.\nThese are so-called \u201cself-insured\u201d plans in which an employer sets aside its own money to cover most of the expected medical costs of workers.\nUnder the guidance, any insurance company that offers coverage to opposite-sex spouses through the marketplace cannot choose to deny that same coverage to legally married same-sex couples."}
