TANF is a federal block grant program for low-income families with children that tries to shepherd people back to work while providing cash assistance.\n\nThis year, 6,441 Nebraskans qualified for a program in which they can get up to $222 per month, plus $71 for additional household members, to help with transportation, clothing, rent and education costs. Recipients can have resources of no more than $6,000 to be eligible for the program.\n\nAuditors found a lack of monitoring of the program by DHHS contractors, timely eligibility reviews and said even after the department was notified of fraud allegations, it failed to follow up.\n\nBefore receiving monthly cash assistance, welfare recipients must search for jobs, education or training, but auditors found the only monitoring of contractors was a monthly random sample review to see if work participation rates were properly calculated.\n\nAuditors found in 20 test cases that DHHS failed to follow its own rules and regulations and properly monitor contractors, causing more than $61,000 in questionable expenses out of a total $79,251 in supportive service payments.\n\nAuditors also examined 20 cases to ensure the recipients were needy, and income wasn\u2019t properly calculated in 11 of 20 cases; they also found nearly $7,800 in overpayments.\n\nAuditors also said there was a lack of procedures to determine if a recipient was properly reporting resources, since caseworkers aren\u2019t required to verify resources worth less than $1,500, regardless of how many resources they had. Recipients cannot have more than $4,000 in resources for single person, $6,000 for two or more.\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nebraska\u2019s state auditor has unearthed a variety of problems with the way Nebraska doles out welfare and monitors the program.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Nebraska\u2019s state auditor has unearthed a variety of problems with the way Nebraska doles out welfare and monitors the program.", "title": "Government Audit Finds Welfare Fraud, Lack of Oversight", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/474057657.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-20T21:33:19+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1uZwx6i"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Nebraska\u2019s state auditor has unearthed a variety of problems with the way Nebraska doles out welfare and monitors the program.", "title": "Government Audit Finds Welfare Fraud, Lack of Oversight", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/474057657.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "welfare", "published_time": "2014-12-21T03:01:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-20T21:33:19+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "welfare, nebraska, audit, waste, welfare reform"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce8ac\"", "article_summary": "Auditors also examined 20 cases to ensure the recipients were needy, and income wasn\u2019t properly calculated in 11 of 20 cases; they also found nearly $7,800 in overpayments.\nAuditors also said there was a lack of procedures to determine if a recipient was properly reporting resources, since caseworkers aren\u2019t required to verify resources worth less than $1,500, regardless of how many resources they had.\nAuditors found a lack of monitoring of the program by DHHS contractors, timely eligibility reviews and said even after the department was notified of fraud allegations, it failed to follow up.\nRecipients cannot have more than $4,000 in resources for single person, $6,000 for two or more.\nRecipients can have resources of no more than $6,000 to be eligible for the program."}
