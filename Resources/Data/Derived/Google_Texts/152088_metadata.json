Their venom doesn\u2019t affect humans, but from the 11th century into the 17th, people thought it caused a form of mania called tarantism that could be calmed only by a frenzied dance called the tarantella.\n\nCURRENT TARANTULAS\n\n\u201cTarantula\u201d now generally refers to members of Theraphosidae, a family of about 900 species worldwide.\n\nVENOM\n\nMost tarantula venom doesn\u2019t affect humans, and doesn\u2019t contain the toxin that can cause anaphylactic shock when people are stung by bees or wasps. A few species from Australia and India have bites more dangerous to people.\n\nHAIRY DANGER\n\nAmerican tarantulas\u2019 hair is more dangerous to people than their bites. Part of their fuzz is called \u201curticating hairs\u201d because they can cause hives. If the hairs get into a small mammal\u2019s nose and throat, the swelling can asphyxiate the animal. People who get them in their eyes may need surgery to remove them.\n\nBIG AND SMALL\n\nThe biggest U.S. tarantulas can have bodies up to 4 inches long, with an 8 inch spread from forefeet to hind feet. The smallest \u201ccan sit very comfortably within the circumference of a quarter,\u201d says biologist Chris Hamilton.\n\nWHERE THEY LIVE\n\nU.S. tarantulas all live west of the Mississippi River, in Arizona, California, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico and Texas.\n\nSPIDER SEX\n\nThe short arm- or antenna-like appendages on each side of a spider\u2019s head are called \u201cpalps\u201d or \u201cpedipalps.\u201d Male spiders use them to transfer sperm to a female\u2019s body.\n\n___\n\nSources:\n\nInterview with Chris Hamilton\n\nScientific paper: http://zookeys.pensoft.net/articles.php?id=6264\n\nArizona-Sonora Desert Museum: https://www.desertmuseum.org/kids/oz/long-fact-sheets/tarantula.php\n\nBurke Museum: http://www.burkemuseum.org/blog/myth-tarantulas-are-dangerous-humans\n\nNational Wildlife Federation: https://www.nwf.org/Wildlife/Wildlife-Library/Invertebrates/Tarantulas.aspx\n\nSan Diego Zoo: http://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/tarantula\n\nTarantulas as pets: http://blogs.cornell.edu/spiders/tarantulas-terrible-or-terrific/\n\nEncyclopedia Brittanica: http://www.britannica.com/art/tarantella", "article_metadata": {"description": "FIRST TARANTULAS", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/15/tarantula-fun-facts-big-spiders-are-delicate-critt/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "FIRST TARANTULAS", "title": "Tarantula fun facts: Big spiders are delicate critters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "FIRST TARANTULAS", "card": "summary", "title": "Tarantula fun facts: Big spiders are delicate critters"}, "Author": "The Associated Press", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "VENOMMost tarantula venom doesn\u2019t affect humans, and doesn\u2019t contain the toxin that can cause anaphylactic shock when people are stung by bees or wasps.\nFIRST TARANTULASEuropean wolf spiders found near the Italian city of Taranto were the first to be called tarantulas.\n___Sources:Interview with Chris HamiltonScientific paper: http://zookeys.pensoft.net/articles.php?id=6264Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum: https://www.desertmuseum.org/kids/oz/long-fact-sheets/tarantula.phpBurke Museum: http://www.burkemuseum.org/blog/myth-tarantulas-are-dangerous-humansNational Wildlife Federation: https://www.nwf.org/Wildlife/Wildlife-Library/Invertebrates/Tarantulas.aspxSan Diego Zoo: http://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/tarantulaTarantulas as pets: http://blogs.cornell.edu/spiders/tarantulas-terrible-or-terrific/Encyclopedia Brittanica: http://www.britannica.com/art/tarantella\nSPIDER SEXThe short arm- or antenna-like appendages on each side of a spider\u2019s head are called \u201cpalps\u201d or \u201cpedipalps.\u201d Male spiders use them to transfer sperm to a female\u2019s body.\nBIG AND SMALLThe biggest U.S. tarantulas can have bodies up to 4 inches long, with an 8 inch spread from forefeet to hind feet."}
