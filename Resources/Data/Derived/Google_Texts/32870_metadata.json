Rather than having to push a button to activate the feature, a user simply speaks the phrase \u201cOK Google Now\u201d to wake up the phone. To place a call, a user would say \u201cOK Google Now, call (person\u2019s name).\u201d The phone can be trained to respond only to the owner\u2019s voice.\n\nIn addition to making calls, voice-activated commands can be used to write a text message (accurately) and search Google for store locations, directions and other information.\n\nThe feature isn\u2019t perfect but works great where you need it the most: in a car. With substantial background noise, the phone doesn\u2019t always wake up. Still, the so-called touchless control feature offered by the Android Jelly Bean-powered Moto X is far more useful than Apple\u2019s Siri, the much-hyped virtual assistant that turned out to be a dud.\n\nSecond, the Moto X\u2019s battery life is remarkable. Under light use \u2014 limited Web surfing, game play and text messaging, and an occasional phone call \u2014 the phone endured two and a half days without a charge before the battery level fell below 15 percent. It easily lasted through the day under typical daily usage, which includes fetching and writing e-mails and heavy mobile Web browsing.\n\nMotorola says it was able to equip the Moto X with more power by using a custom-shaped battery that bolsters capacity by 31 percent without adding bulk.\n\nLastly, the phone\u2019s appearance is customizable, the feature that drew the most attention when the device was unveiled this summer. The phone is assembled in the U.S., allowing Google to offer custom options with the promise of delivery within four business days.\n\nThrough the Motorola website, consumers can design the look of the Moto X by picking among 18 colors for the backplate and seven for the accents, such as the power and volume buttons. The front of the phone comes in white or black.\n\nThe so-called Moto Maker also allows consumers to select the splash message when the phone powers up and add accessories such as earbuds from SOL Republic. Backplate engraving wasn\u2019t available when I went through the ordering process.\n\nWhile the phone is available for the four major carriers, AT&T currently holds the exclusive on the custom options.\n\nThe Moto X costs $200 with a two-year contract from AT&T, though reports have surfaced that the price will drop to $100 before the end of the year.\n\nIt costs $600 contract-free from T-Mobile.\n\nThe Moto X\u2019s specs are fairly standard: a 4.7-inch touchscreen, 10-megapixel rear camera and 2 megapixel front camera, 2 gigabytes of RAM and 16 gigabytes or 2 gigabytes of storage. It sports a curved plastic backing that feels a bit cheap when compared to the HTC One\u2019s aluminum body. The volume button is more difficult to press than it should be.\n\nOne other noteworthy item is the Motorola Skip magnetic accessory included with the phone. The wearable gadget is similar to Samsung\u2019s TecTile tags, though it does only one thing. When the Moto X touches the Skip, the phone\u2019s screen will automatically unlock, eliminating the need to swipe a pattern or enter a PIN.\n\nThe price drop to $100 with a contract would put the Moto X in direct competition with Apple\u2019s forthcoming iPhone 5C. Based on specs released by Apple last week, the 5C is essentially the year-old iPhone 5 with a plastic backplate and an updated operating system.\n\nUnless you\u2019re a die-hard Apple fan, the Moto X is the more appealing option.\n\nAndy Vuong : 303-954-1209, avuong@denverpost.com or fb.com/byandyvuong", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Review: Three highlights of the Moto X, Google\u2019s first real smartphone", "title": "Review: Three highlights of the Moto X, Google\u2019s first real smartphone", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/13/review-three-highlights-of-the-moto-x-googles-first-real-smartphone/", "image": {"width": 337, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130913__20130916_C8_BZ16MOTOX1p1.jpg", "height": 600}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130913__20130916_C8_BZ16MOTOX1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-13T19:49:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T14:51:19+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda50f\"", "article_summary": "The price drop to $100 with a contract would put the Moto X in direct competition with Apple\u2019s forthcoming iPhone 5C.\nUnless you\u2019re a die-hard Apple fan, the Moto X is the more appealing option.\nWhen the Moto X touches the Skip, the phone\u2019s screen will automatically unlock, eliminating the need to swipe a pattern or enter a PIN.\nTo start, the Moto X handles voice commands better than any phone before it.\nThe Moto X costs $200 with a two-year contract from AT&T, though reports have surfaced that the price will drop to $100 before the end of the year."}
