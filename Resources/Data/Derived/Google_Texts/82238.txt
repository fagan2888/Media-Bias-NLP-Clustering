The International Union for the Conservation of Nature has listed the Brazilian three-banded armadillo as one of the many species under threat worldwide. Brazil's population of the three-banded armadillo is armadillo species endemic to Brazil, where it is known as tatu-bola.

It is one of only two species of armadillo that has ability to roll like a ball. In the past few years, its population has declined significantly. The IUCN said the species' population has declined by more than a third over the past 10 years.

The IUCN warned that the lemurs are facing extinction threat. Out of the 101 surviving species, 22 are under threat, including indri and Madame Berthe's mouse lemur. The IUCN explained that political uncertainty and poverty have brought a rise in illegal logging.

Lemurs also face extinction risk due to destruction of their tropical forest habitat in Madagascar. The IUCN said around 80% of temperate slipper orchids found in North America are facing extinction risk. Nearly 79% of species of lemurs face extinction threat. Habitat destruction and excessive harvesting of wild species for sale are considered to be main reasons for extinction threat.

Hassan Rankou of the IUCN's orchid team based in the Royal Botanic Gardens in London said slipper orchids were considered to be popular in the horticultural industry. "Although the industry is sustained by cultivated stock, conservation of wild species is vital for its future", affirmed Rankou.

The California lady's slipper found in California and Oregon has been classified as endangered. Japanese eel, Chinese Crocodile Lizard, Banana Orchid and Yarkon Bream, among others, have also been classified as endangered.
