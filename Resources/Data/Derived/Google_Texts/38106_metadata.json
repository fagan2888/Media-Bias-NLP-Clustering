Livestream courtesy Arkansas Educational Television Network.\n\nFour Arkansas politicians will take to the debate stage on Thursday afternoon, each to make the case that he is the best replacement for that state\u2019s enormously popular outgoing governor.\n\nAsa Hutchinson (R), Mike Ross (D), J. Joshua Drake (G), and Frank Gilbert (L) will meet on the University of Central Arkansas campus at 3 p.m. EDT on Thursday, Oct. 16.\n\nThe Arkansas Educational Television Network and AARP Arkansas co-sponsor. Steve Barnes, host of AETN\u2019s \u201cArkansas Week,\u201d moderates. Arkansas journalists Michael Hibblen of KUAR, David Goins of Fox 16/KARK, and Rusty Turner, of the Northwest Arkansas Times, will ask questions of the candidates.\n\nThe debate will be re-broadcast across the state and online at 9 p.m. EST that night.\n\nGov. Mike Beebe, a centrist Democrat who has enjoyed consistently high approval ratings, even as his state\u2019s voters moved steadily toward the right, must step down due to term limits.\n\nThis has opened the field to a surprisingly competitive race, competitive in part because of the contentious Senate battle also going on in the state. Millions in outside contributions for that contest may spill over into the gubernatorial campaign.\n\nPolls show Hutchinson and Ross, both former Congressmen, all but tied, with a slight edge for Hutchinson.\n\nCompare this to Beebe\u2019s 2010 campaign, when he roundly defeated his Republican challenger by 30 points, winning all 75 counties in the state. (He also won his 2006 election by 15 points. That year\u2019s opponent? Asa Hutchinson.)\n\nHealth care is a central concern to Arkansas voters, and both major party gubernatorial candidates have come out against the Affordable Care Act. Ross was one of three Democrats in the House to vote for its repeal. But he also supports the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion, including its \u201cprivate option,\u201d which Beebe championed.\n\nThe candidates will also likely spar over a ballot measure to raise the state\u2019s minimum wage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Four Arkansas politicians will take to the debate stage on Thursday afternoon, each to make the case that he is the best replacement for that state\u2019s enormously popular outgoing governor.", "pubdate": 20141016, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Four Arkansas politicians will take to the debate stage on Thursday afternoon, each to make the case that he is the best replacement for that state\u2019s enormously popular outgoing governor.", "title": "WATCH LIVE: Arkansas governor's debate", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ArkansasRace.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/arkansas-governors-debate/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Four Arkansas politicians will take to the debate stage on Thursday afternoon, each to make the case that he is the best replacement for that state\u2019s enormously popular outgoing governor.", "title": "WATCH LIVE: Arkansas governor's debate", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ArkansasRace.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "mike ross"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Arkansas, asa hutchinson, Election 2014, Mike Beebe, mike ross"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc3e4\"", "article_summary": "Watch Arkansas\u2019 candidates for governor debate live on AETN, on Thursday, Oct. 16 at 3 p.m. EDT, featuring Asa Hutchinson (R), Mike Ross (D), Joshua Drake (G), and Frank Gilbert (L).\nHealth care is a central concern to Arkansas voters, and both major party gubernatorial candidates have come out against the Affordable Care Act.\nThe Arkansas Educational Television Network and AARP Arkansas co-sponsor.\nArkansas journalists Michael Hibblen of KUAR, David Goins of Fox 16/KARK, and Rusty Turner, of the Northwest Arkansas Times, will ask questions of the candidates.\nAsa Hutchinson (R), Mike Ross (D), J.
