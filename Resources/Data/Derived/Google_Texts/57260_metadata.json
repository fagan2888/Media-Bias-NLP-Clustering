While there will be warm discussions on areas of common concern, religious liberty is sure to be a contentious item on the agenda once again; events both domestically and internationally have ensured that.\n\nInternationally, it\u2019s not so much what the president has done, as what he has not done. It\u2019s the deafening silence in the face of heart wrenching and barbaric persecution of Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East. Pope Francis is likely to raise this as a central issue in the private White House meeting on Wednesday, and again on Thursday when he addresses Congress.\n\nPope Francis does not mince words in describing the ethnic cleansing and persecution of Middle Eastern Christians, Yazidis and others, saying it is \u201cgenocide\u201d and should be named as such. Mr. Obama and congressional leaders will hear a plea similar to one Francis delivered this summer, when he said, \u201cIn this third world war, waged piecemeal, which we are now experiencing, a form of genocide \u2014 and I stress the word genocide \u2014 is taking place, and it must end.\u201d\n\nWhat else can it be called when the Islamic State brutally invades the cradle of Christianity, beheading, crucifying, terrorizing and selling women and girls into sexual slavery? In compelling testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee this Spring, an Iraqi nun named Sister Diana Momeka told of the horrors she witnesses as she fled Mosul: \u201cISIS\u2019s plan is to evacuate the land of Christians and wipe the earth clean of any evidence that we ever existed.\u201d\n\nAs former Rep. Frank Wolf, known as the \u201cconscience of the Congress\u201d for his work on this issue, has said, \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in Iraq and Syria today is genocide . I visited Iraq in January of this year going through villages to the front lines . I came back and asked, does this administration care? Does the Congress care?\u201d\n\nPope Francis will be asking the same question \u2014 do we care? Some in Congress care deeply, and are leading a bipartisan effort to declare these atrocities to be genocide. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, Nebraska Republican, and Rep. Anna Eshoo, California Democrat, are co-sponsoring a bipartisan resolution (H. Con. Res. 75) declaring that those who commit \u201catrocities against Christians and other ethnic and religious minorities are committing \u2018war crimes,\u2019 \u2018crimes against humanity,\u2019 and \u2018genocide.\u2019\u201d They are calling for the United States and the international community to end their \u201cscandalous silence\u201d in the face of this persecution, and for protection, humanitarian assistance and expedited refugee processing for these targeted populations. Mr. Fortenberry even traveled to Rome last month and presented the Holy Father a draft of this resolution.\n\nMr. Obama says he cares too, promising at the National Prayer Breakfast to \u201cconstantly reaffirm that fundamental freedom \u2014 freedom of religion \u2014 the right to practice our faith how we choose and to do so free of persecution and fear and discrimination.\u201d\n\nOn the domestic front, the mere planning of the papal visit has already served to highlight tensions. Making use of its home field advantage, the White House invited to the pope\u2019s welcome ceremony activists who endorse policies that directly infringe upon the religious freedom of the Catholic Church. No matter the disregard for basic diplomatic protocol, or simple courtesy towards an honored guest.\n\nGiven the Holy Father\u2019s emphasis on poverty, the White House might have invited nuns known for their selfless and joyful care of the indigent elderly, the Little Sisters of the Poor. That however, would have created an awkwardness of another kind, since Mr. Obama\u2019s lawyers are currently fighting the Little Sisters in court to force them to facilitate contraceptive coverage in their health plans. The litany of this administration\u2019s offenses against religious liberty goes well beyond the Obamacare mandate, and promises to intensify in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s Obergefell v. Hodges same-sex marriage decision.\n\nPerhaps this week\u2019s meeting with Pope Francis will be an opportunity for Mr. Obama to recognize the gross incongruity between his words and actions. Miracles do happen.\n\n\u2022 Maureen Malloy Ferguson is the senior policy advisor for The Catholic Association.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When the pope and the president first met a year and a half ago at the Vatican, a major topic of concern raised by Pope Francis was the need for cooperation between church and state, particularly with regard to the exercise of religious freedom.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "When the pope and the president first met a year and a half ago at the Vatican, a major topic of concern raised by Pope Francis was the need for cooperation between church and state, particularly with regard to the exercise of religious freedom.", "title": "Religious liberty: The president\u2019s words and deeds", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/22/religious-liberty-the-presidents-words-and-deeds/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/22/9_222015_ferguson8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/22/9_222015_ferguson8201.jpg", "description": "When the pope and the president first met a year and a half ago at the Vatican, a major topic of concern raised by Pope Francis was the need for cooperation between church and state, particularly with", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Religious liberty: The president\u2019s words and deeds"}, "Author": "Maureen Malloy Ferguson", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Religion Belief, Francis"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce012\"", "article_summary": "Perhaps this week\u2019s meeting with Pope Francis will be an opportunity for Mr. Obama to recognize the gross incongruity between his words and actions.\nIt\u2019s the deafening silence in the face of heart wrenching and barbaric persecution of Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East.\nOn Wednesday we will witness another meeting between pope and president, this time on President Obama\u2019s turf.\nPope Francis is likely to raise this as a central issue in the private White House meeting on Wednesday, and again on Thursday when he addresses Congress.\nPope Francis does not mince words in describing the ethnic cleansing and persecution of Middle Eastern Christians, Yazidis and others, saying it is \u201cgenocide\u201d and should be named as such."}
