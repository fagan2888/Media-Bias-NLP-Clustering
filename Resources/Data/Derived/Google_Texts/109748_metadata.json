Turns out, the damage done to the field wasn\u2019t just the result of typical Cubby incompetence.\n\nEarlier that night, Cubs management had sent home 10 workers, in part to keep them under 30 hours a week \u2014 and avoid paying health benefits under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhich is exactly what\u2019s happening in business after business across America. According to new survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, 18% of businesses in that metro area reported cutting back on jobs and employees as a result of the law \u2014 and just 3% report hiring more.\n\nThe New York Fed found similar results: Around a fifth of the state\u2019s manufacturers and service firms said Obamacare was leading them to cut the number of workers they employ.\n\nThis is not to say that a baseball franchise worth more than $1 billion can\u2019t afford to extend insurance to all its workers, just that a law intended to spread coverage to millions is, like an untested drug, having perverse side effects.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Editorials", "twitter": {"description": "Damning evidence that Obamacare is a drag on the U.S. job market has just entered a hallowed American industry: professional baseball.", "title": "Obamacare curveball", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/obamacare-curveball-article-1.1913911", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1913910.1408749581!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/athletics-cubs-baseball.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Editorials", "parsely-type": "article", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-08-25T08:05:11", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/obamacare-curveball-article-1.1913911", "parsely-title": "Obamacare curveball", "sailthru.date": "2014-08-25T04:05:11-0400", "sailthru.title": "Obamacare curveball", "nydn_section": "Opinion", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1913910.1408749581!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/athletics-cubs-baseball.jpg", "description": "Damning evidence that Obamacare is a drag on the U.S. job market has just entered a hallowed American industry: professional baseball.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "Opinion", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Damning evidence that Obamacare is a drag on the U.S. job market has just entered a hallowed American industry: professional baseball.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Damning evidence that Obamacare is a drag on the U.S. job market has just entered a hallowed American industry: professional baseball.", "title": "Obamacare curveball", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/obamacare-curveball-article-1.1913911", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1913910.1408749581!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/athletics-cubs-baseball.jpg", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Editorials", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1913910.1408749581!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/athletics-cubs-baseball.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd27da\"", "article_summary": "Damning evidence that Obamacare is a drag on the U.S. job market has just entered a hallowed American industry: professional baseball.\nThe New York Fed found similar results: Around a fifth of the state\u2019s manufacturers and service firms said Obamacare was leading them to cut the number of workers they employ.\nEarlier that night, Cubs management had sent home 10 workers, in part to keep them under 30 hours a week \u2014 and avoid paying health benefits under the Affordable Care Act.\nTurns out, the damage done to the field wasn\u2019t just the result of typical Cubby incompetence.\n(The game was then called by the crew chief, handing the Cubs a 2-0 victory, before the Giants protested and, making history, prevailed \u2014 and the game was resumed Thursday night.)"}
