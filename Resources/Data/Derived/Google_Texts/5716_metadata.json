Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. to vacate an opinion of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit and remand our case for consideration,\u201d Paul Browne, the University\u2019s vice president for public affairs and communications, said in a statement. \u201cThe 7th Circuit had denied Notre Dame\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order regarding government-mandated contraceptive services.\n\n\u201cIn [this] filing, Notre Dame continues to challenge the federal mandate as an infringement on our fundamental right to the free exercise of our Catholic faith.\u201d\n\nSara Shoemake\n\nNotre Dame\u2019s lawsuit against the Department of Health and Human Services argues that the provision of the Affordable Care Act that orders health care plans to cover contraceptives violates its religious beliefs, even if the University isn\u2019t paying for the coverage. The University currently provides the coverage through its third-party health care administrator, Meritain Health, in accordance with the accommodation available to religious employers.\n\nIn the filing, attorneys Matthew Kairis and Noel Francisco wrote that \u201cthe lower courts declined to protect the University of Notre Dame du Lac from being forced to violate its religious beliefs by participating in a regulatory scheme to provide its employees and students with coverage for abortion-inducing products, contraceptives and sterilization.\u201d\n\nThe petition argues that the 7th Circuit Court\u2019s decision \u201ccannot be reconciled\u201d with the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on Hobby Lobby.\n\n\u201cContrary to Hobby Lobby\u2019s clear command, the 7th Circuit chose to conduct a lengthy analysis of whether Notre Dame was correct in its assertion that the actions it must take to comply with the accommodation would \u2018make the University an accomplice in the provision of contraception, in violation of Catholic doctrine,\u201d the petition states. \u201cThe 7th Circuit failed to appreciate that whether a particular action makes the University complicit in the provision of contraceptive coverage is a religious judgment, rooted in Catholic teachings regarding the permissible degree of entanglement in illicit conduct.\u201d\n\nThe petition further argues that the accommodation allowing Notre Dame to provide the contraceptive coverage through Meritain Health still imposes \u201ca substantial burden\u201d since Notre Dame still has a religious objection to maintaining that contractual relationship.\n\n\u201cThe government has effectively \u2018poisoned\u2019 the insurance market for Notre Dame, making it impossible to offer health coverage consistent with its religious beliefs,\u201d the attorneys wrote. \u201cJust as a Mormon might refuse to hire a caterer that insisted on serving alcohol to his wedding guests, or a Jew might refuse to hire a caterer determined to serve pork at his son\u2019s bar mitzvah, it violates Notre Dame\u2019s religious beliefs to hire or maintain a relationship with any third party that will provide contraceptive care to its plan beneficiaries.\u201d\n\nIn June, Notre Dame law professor Rick Garnett told The Observer that Hobby Lobby was not yet technically eligible for the same accommodation as Notre Dame since it is a for-profit, nonreligious corporation. However, \u201cit is still an open question whether the revised mandate violates the [Religious Freedom Restoration] Act as applied to Notre Dame and other religious employers.\u201d\n\nHowever, both Hobby Lobby and Notre Dame \u201care both entitled to invoke the [Religious Freedom Restoration Act]\u2019s protections,\u201d which was enacted by Congress to provide more generous accommodations to religious objectors than the Constitution requires, Garnett said.\n\nIn an essay published on the SCOTUS blog, law professor and director of Notre Dame\u2019s Center for Ethics and Culture O. Carter Snead wrote that the Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby decision \u201cfollows from the most natural and straightforward reading of [the Religious Freedom Restoration Act], given both its text and the jurisprudence in which it is situated.\u201d\n\nThe attorneys\u2019 argument in the petition concurs with Snead\u2019s analysis of the accommodation in his essay.\n\n\u201cThe accommodation in this context forces the religious employer to say \u2018no\u2019 in a manner that functions as a legally operative \u2018yes,\u2019\u201d Snead wrote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The student newspaper of Notre Dame and St. Mary's", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "The Observer", "description": "In May 2012, Notre Dame filed its initial lawsuit for relief from Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraceptive mandate.
