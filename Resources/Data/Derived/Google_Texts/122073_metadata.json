Al-Qaeda in Yemen took responsibility for the attack.\n\nThe extremists cited the magazine\u2019s publishing of images of the prophet as the reason for the murders. In Islam, it is considered blasphemous to draw pictures or representations of Muhammad.\n\nCharlie Hebdo responded to the January attacks by featuring another image of Muhammad on the cover of the next publication they released. A sign above the Prophet\u2019s head read \u201cTout est pardonn\u00e9\u201d or \u201cAll is forgiven.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have drawn Muhammad to defend the principle that one can draw whatever they want,\u201d Sourisseau explained to Stern.\n\n\u201cIt is a bit strange though: We are expected to exercise a freedom of expression that no one dares to,\u201d he added.\n\nSince the January attacks, Charlie Hebdo has appeared to soften its position about publishing depictions of Muhammad. However, Sourisseau insisted that this new decision has nothing to do with the violent terrorist attacks.\n\n\u201cWe still believe that we have the right to criticize all religions,\u201d Sourisseau said.\n\nThe editor clarified that he did not want people to begin thinking that the publication is \u201cpossessed by Islam.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe mistakes you could blame Islam for can be found in other religions,\u201d Sourisseau said.\n\nAlthough Charlie Hebdo will no longer publish images of Muhammad, this does not mean that they will leave Islam alone entirely.\n\nThe satirical team reserves the right to prod at Islam in the same way they do any other faith.", "article_metadata": {"description": "French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo will no longer publish depictions of the Prophet Muhammad, according to editor Laurent Sourisseau.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo will no longer publish depictions of the Prophet Muhammad, according to editor Laurent Sourisseau.", "title": "Why Charlie Hebdo Stopped Drawing the Prophet Muhammad", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/charlie-hebdo-feature-edit.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-23T16:03:13+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Jhn5WV"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo will no longer publish depictions of the Prophet Muhammad, according to editor Laurent Sourisseau.", "title": "Why Charlie Hebdo Stopped Drawing the Prophet Muhammad", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/charlie-hebdo-feature-edit.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "europe", "published_time": "2015-07-23T14:05:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-23T16:03:13+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Charlie Hebdo, free speech, Prophet Muhammad, France, satirical magazine"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe26ce\"", "article_summary": "French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo will no longer publish depictions of the Prophet Muhammad, according to editor Laurent Sourisseau.\nAlthough Charlie Hebdo will no longer publish images of Muhammad, this does not mean that they will leave Islam alone entirely.\nCharlie Hebdo responded to the January attacks by featuring another image of Muhammad on the cover of the next publication they released.\nSince the January attacks, Charlie Hebdo has appeared to soften its position about publishing depictions of Muhammad.\n\u201cWe still believe that we have the right to criticize all religions,\u201d Sourisseau said."}
