Stacey, whose youngest is graduating from DHS this year, has consistently contributed to Dublin schools for many years. Stacey is always willing to go above and beyond, not only stepping into leadership roles but recreating and expanding those roles. Some highlights of her accomplishments include:\n\nWith Yvonne Nickles, creating and implementing the \u201cRaise Your Class Gaela\u201d to bring in more funding for Dublin High\n\nSingle-handedly inventing the \u201cCyber Stacey\u201d parent communication role and process at DHS\n\nIncredible loyalty to her son\u2019s class working as a Parent Rep for four years\n\nServing as a leadership member of the Athletic Boosters team for seven years\n\nStacey is a strong advocate for things she believes will make Dublin schools better. She clearly and persuasively makes her point, isn\u2019t afraid to debate when necessary, and inspires others through her hard work and tireless commitment. Most importantly, while some others talk a good game, we all know Stacey will \u201cget \u2018er done.\u201d\n\nIf I asked any DHS parent who they get most of their information from, they\u2019d answer without hesitation: \u201cCyber Stacey.\u201d And just as a side note, it\u2019s going to take 3-4 new volunteers to begin to fill her shoes next year!!\n\nWe so appreciate her hard work and we wish her all the best. DHS will miss her very much!\n\nFundraisers Galore\n\n*** It\u2019s that time of year again, the 2014 Alameda County Fair is right around the corner! The fair runs from June 18-July 6th and is open Tuesday-Sunday. The Class of 2016 is pre-selling fair tickets and carnival wristbands at a discounted rate. Orders will be taken through Friday, June 6th\n\n*** The Class of 2015 is selling single strand Orchid Leis for Graduation. The cost is $20.00. Approximately 50 orchid blossoms are strung lengthwise to create this understated Hawaiian lei. Please send a check, made payable to DHS Class of 2015- marked \u201clei\u201d, to :\n\nPatricia Wilcox\n\n3238 S Bridgepointe Ln\n\nDublin Ca 94568\n\nOrders need to be turned in by Friday, June 6th. Leis will be ready for pickup around June 11. Any questions? Call Patricia 925-548-8201\n\n***The Class of 2017 will be selling discounted movie tickets throughout the summer. These tickets will be available to pick up at several different homes around town for your convenience. These non-pass restricted tickets are $8 each.\n\nFor more information or to purchase tickets, contact Terri Dyer at bydyer@comcast.net. For smaller orders you can contact Shari Jackman (858-2500) or Rosemary Brassea at rbrassea@hotmail.com.\n\nSpecial Thanks to our Parent Reps!\n\nThe PFSO would like to take the opportunity to thank our Parent Representatives:\n\nSenior Reps- Stacey Maloney and Yvonne Nickles\n\nJunior Reps- Tamara Elias and Patricia Wilcox\n\nSophomore Rep- Stephanie Stanley, Kelly Timm and Kristen Finn\n\nFreshman Reps- Terri Dyer, Shari Jackman and Rosemary Brassea\n\nThe majority of the parent community probably isn\u2019t aware of the depth of volunteerism and commitment required to be a parent rep. These ladies work tirelessly throughout the year, EVERY YEAR, for FOUR YEARS!!\n\nWithout their kindness and dedication to our students, there would be no Grad Night, no Senior Picnic, Senior Breakfast, Homecoming and the list goes on and on. If you happen to see these ladies, please make sure to take the opportunity to thank them for the great job they are doing!!\n\nDublin High School Schedule Change Town Hall Meetings!\n\nThe District will be holding two Town Hall meetings \u2013 one on Thursday, June 5 at Fallon Middle School and the second on Monday, June 9 at Dublin High School. Both meetings will begin at 6:30pm.\n\nIn an effort to boldly enhance educational opportunities for our students at Dublin High School, the district is in the process of developing a plan that will significantly improve the learning environment.\n\nIf approved by the Board of Trustees, the plan that is in development will alter the structure of the school day at DHS and is likely to lengthen the time students are on campus.\n\nPlease plan to attend one of the scheduled Town Hall meetings to learn more about the exciting plans.\n\nGoodbye to Terri Oravetz\n\nIt is with a heavy heart that we say goodbye to Mrs. Oravetz in Student Activities at the end of this school year.\n\nTerri has been a huge help to the PFSO throughout the years. From collecting money for our various fundraisers and events to answering questions and taking care of small details as we need them, without Terri we could not be the successful organization that we are.\n\nWe wish her much happiness in her retirement and thank her for her many years of service.\n\nThank You\n\nI wanted to give a big thank you to Chris Bennett, our PFSO President who was also the editor and fact checker for my newsletters this year. I truly appreciate her help.\n\nSincerely, Stacey Maloney", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "OneDublin.org", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Dublin High School PFSO Gael Gazette\u00a06-1-2014 | OneDublin.org on WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "OneDublin.org", "description": "Important updates for Dublin High School parents from the Dublin High PFSO.
