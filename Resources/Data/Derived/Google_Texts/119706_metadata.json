This scandal not only speaks to her lack of a moral compass, but also to her lack of a backbone. Most of the women I know in law enforcement, especially the ones in charge, are some of the toughest broads out there. But this wimp says she can\u2019t fire, she can\u2019t discipline, she can\u2019t take away their security clearances. But what she can do is build on and improve. Build on and improve what?\u201d she stated.\n\nPirro added that if Leonhart \u201creally wanted to make a difference [she] would go to Congress and get the law changed. But, then again, the law didn\u2019t need to be changed\u2026don\u2019t you think that cavorting with cartel hookers would fall under conduct unbecoming a DEA employee? Or disrespectful/unprofessional conduct? Or improper association with a convicted felon or persons connected with criminal activity? Or unprofessional off-duty conduct?\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Judge Jeanine Pirro slammed DEA Chief Michele Leonhart over the scandal involving DEA agents participating in sex parties with drug cartels.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Judge Jeanine Pirro slammed DEA Chief Michele Leonhart over the scandal involving DEA agents participating in sex parties with drug cartels.", "title": "Pirro: DEA Head Lacks 'Moral Compass' and 'Backbone' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/Pirro-DEA-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/04/18/pirro-dea-head-lacks-moral-compass-and-backbone/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Judge Jeanine Pirro slammed DEA Chief Michele Leonhart over the scandal involving DEA agents participating in sex parties with drug cartels.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/Pirro-DEA-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Pirro: DEA Head Lacks 'Moral Compass' and 'Backbone' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "DEA, Jeanine Pirro, Michele Leonhart,Breitbart TV,DEA", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "Michele Leonhart", "published_time": "2015-04-18T19:11:55-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "This scandal not only speaks to her lack of a moral compass, but also to her lack of a backbone.\nMost of the women I know in law enforcement, especially the ones in charge, are some of the toughest broads out there.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROn Saturday, the Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cJustice with Judge Jeanine\u201d host Judge Jeanine Pirro slammed DEA Chief Michele Leonhart over the scandal involving DEA agents participating in sex parties with drug cartels.\nBut this wimp says she can\u2019t fire, she can\u2019t discipline, she can\u2019t take away their security clearances.\nPirro added that if Leonhart \u201creally wanted to make a difference [she] would go to Congress and get the law changed."}
