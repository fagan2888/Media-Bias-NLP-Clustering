Rick Scott\u2019s (R) effort to save his state\u2019s Medicaid program money on the backs of the poor just backfired.\n\nIn 2012, the Scott administration lobbied the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to allow it to limit the number of times that Medicaid beneficiaries can frequent emergency rooms to six visits. The Obama administration rejected that request, arguing that it constitutes a violation of the Social Security Act by placing \u201can arbitrary limit\u201d on a legally mandated benefit, and that it has the potential to harm poor patients, the Miami Herald reports.\n\nBut the Scott administration ignored CMS\u2019s decision and instituted the ER cap after filing an appeal. Now, CMS has responded by warning that it will withhold federal matching funds for Florida\u2019s Medicaid program if the state doesn\u2019t change its tactics.\n\n\u201cWe hope the state will realign their Medicaid program with federal standards to avoid this penalty,\u201d said Emma Sandoe, a CMS spokesperson, in a statement.\n\nThe fine is expected to be a 10 percent reduction in matching funds in the first year, with an additional five percent cut in subsequent quarters.\n\nThe Scott administration argues that limiting emergency room visits is a way to encourage patients to stay out of the costly emergency care departments, and encourage them to use more cost-effective preventative and primary care doctor visits instead. Health care experts agree that primary care is preferable to using the emergency room \u2014 but people who enroll in Medicaid for the first time may not understand that from the get-go. Uninsured people typically rely on emergency departments and aren\u2019t used to navigating doctor\u2019s offices. Consequently, Medicaid beneficiaries may take some time to get acquainted with the nuances of the health care system.\n\nIt\u2019s also unclear how effective such a cap would be at controlling costs, considering that just one percent of enrollees even use emergency departments six or more times in a year. As such, the cap may end up harming patients who legitimately have to use the ER a disproportionate number of times.\n\nOnly a sliver of the poorest Florida residents \u2014 parents with dependent children who make just a third of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) \u2014 are eligible for Medicaid in the first place. Florida lawmakers have rejected the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Gov.
