The tribe\u2019s leaders have vowed to file suit against the agency.\n\nWhile the river remains closed, the Navajo Nation says it will continue to work with the Bureau of Indian Affairs to provide water to residents for irrigation, livestock and drinking purposes.\n\nJesse Paul: 303-954-1733, jpaul@denverpost.com or twitter.com/JesseAPaul", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Navajo Nation not lifting San Juan River closure after EPA OK\u2019s water", "title": "Navajo Nation not lifting San Juan River closure after EPA OK\u2019s water", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/24/navajo-nation-not-lifting-san-juan-river-closure-after-epa-oks-water/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150817__20150818_A1_A1-cd18navajoaghpp1-3.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150817__20150818_A1_A1-cd18navajoaghpp1-3.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-24T17:26:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T09:11:35+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Animas River-Spill, Pollution, Water"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9337\"", "article_summary": "The Navajo Nation said Monday morning it will not reopen the San Juan River for agricultural use even after the Environmental Protection Agency announced last week water quality rebounded from the major mine wastewater spill upstream.\nThe tribe says it is waiting on testing from its internal environmental agency before reopening the river.\nThe contamination left the Navajo, already mistrustful of the federal government, angry at the EPA and seeking damages.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad the (EPA) water samples indicate the water is safe for irrigation use, but I remain concerned over the soil and sediment that lines our (river\u2019s) bank,\u201d said tribe President Russell Begaye in a statement.\nWhile the river remains closed, the Navajo Nation says it will continue to work with the Bureau of Indian Affairs to provide water to residents for irrigation, livestock and drinking purposes."}
