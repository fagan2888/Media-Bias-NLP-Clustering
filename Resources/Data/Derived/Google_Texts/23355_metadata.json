Females, fags, and five-year-olds drool!\u201d\n\nIf nothing else, such naked, hate-filled speech reveals the visceral rage of a woman who has thrown reason to the wind.\n\nFrom the hysterical tone of the article, in fact, one would get the impression that America is in forced lockdown under the boot of an all-oppressive conservative establishment. This is clearly not the case, but it may be encouraging for conservatives to hear that, at least in the minds of liberals, all is not lost for the conservative cause.\n\nThe author then lays out her own lengthy program for guilt-free, no-strings-attached sex with whomever you want, whenever you want, in whatever manner you want, regardless of the consequences. As the paragraphs drag on it become clear that the one obsessed with sex here is Tarico, not the conservatives she rails against.\n\nAs the article (finally!) wraps up, it become clear that Tarico\u2019s real beef is not really with conservatives at all, but with God. The Bible and the God it proclaims is the real problem here.\n\nTarico says that \u201cpatriarchal Christian men are obsessed with lording it over women, queers and kids\u201d because in the view of the Bible writers \u201cthat is the right and proper order of things, ordained by Yahweh himself\u2014who, by the way, gets really mean when people don\u2019t do things his way.\u201d\n\nAnd so, she concludes, the reason \u201cwhy patriarchal Christians are so obsessed with controlling sex\u201d lies in this \u201cIron Age script.\u201d\n\nSometimes it takes the histrionics of an unhinged liberal crying \u201cUncle\u201d to realize that things may not be as bad as they seem.\n\nFollow Thomas D.
