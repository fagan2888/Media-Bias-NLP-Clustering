(AP) - Mary Venturacci is 98 years old and lives by herself in her northeast Salem home.\n\nIt\u2019s an ideal situation for most older adults, who prefer to continue living in the comfort of their home and maintain independence. But it takes some work.\n\nMuch of it falls on her daughter, Wanda Urban, who helps Venturacci with her health care, medications, grocery shopping and more. Another good portion falls on Venturacci\u2019s Kaiser Permanente nurse practitioner, Marty Surface, who provides her with primary care services at her home.\n\nWhen Surface made his first visit with Venturacci, he immediately recommended changes \u2014 to the home. The bathroom needed bars to help her get down and up. The bed\u2019s wheels needed stoppers to make sure it doesn\u2019t move around too much when Venturacci lands on it. Surface then taught Venturacci how to use her walker.\n\nThese are all things a typical primary care doctor in a clinic setting would not have been able to do, yet they could have a profound impact on Venturacci\u2019s health outcomes.\n\nOne out of three adults aged 65 and older fall each year, which can lead to hospitalizations, loss of independence, worsening health and death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 95 percent of hip fractures are caused by falls.\n\nFall prevention is key to keeping frail, older people healthy.\n\nHouse calls, which may conjure an image from a different generation, when doctors traveled with black satchels, are gaining recognition for their effectiveness in lowering costs and improving outcomes for the most fragile, complex \u2014 and, in turn, most costly \u2014 health care consumers.\n\nKaiser Permanente began its Primary Care at Home program in 2007 and started expanding its reach to Salem a year and a half ago. Its patient base has grown from 500 to 1,500 people, but more could be helped.\n\nSurface, who serves 102 patients, is currently the only house call provider in the Salem area, but Kaiser is looking to hire another provider, as there are about 100 people on the waiting list.\n\nThe only requirement is that the patients be home-bound, or face significant challenges making clinic appointments.\n\nIn a cohort of 554 Kaiser Permanente patients, preliminary data show that house calls have helped decrease costs by 40 percent, emergency room visits by 40 percent and hospital admissions by 60 percent.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s home care demonstration for Medicare patients showed similar gains.\n\nFirst-year results of the three-year Affordable Care Act study, Independence at Home, showed that offering house calls to Medicare patients with complex conditions and high needs saved Medicare $25 million. Medicare rewarded participating providers who met certain quality measures with incentive payments, and Portland-based Housecall Providers collected $1.2 million for its first year\u2019s performance.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation to extend the program for two additional years and now awaits President Barack Obama\u2019s approval.\n\nOregon Democrat Sen. Ron Wyden, who championed Independence at Home from early on, also helped introduce the extension.\n\n\u201cIndependence at Home has shown that providing quality health care to seniors in their home works for beneficiaries, works for health providers, and works for Medicare,\u201d Wyden said in a statement. \u201cGiven the strong first year results of the demonstration, a two-year extension is a no-brainer. Independence at Home is an important step towards reducing our nation\u2019s inefficient and expensive patchwork of health care delivery systems.\u201d\n\nMuch of what house calls allow providers to do is not medical in nature.\n\nShari Sanders, chief of geriatrics and long-term care for Kaiser Permanente Northwest, said it allows clinicians to detect a crisis before it begins.\n\n\u201cWho cooks for you? How do you get dressed? How do you go to the grocery store?\u201d Sanders said, listing the type of information providers gather during home visits. \u201cAnd who\u2019s your social support? What\u2019s in your fridge? Your eyes are opened a little bit more.\u201d\n\nDuring a recent visit with Venturacci, who experiences swelling in her legs, Surface discussed reducing the patient\u2019s blood pressure medication dose by half to see if that might improve her symptoms.\n\nIf the pills are easy to cut, then Venturacci would be able to avoid a separate copay refilling a new prescription, Surface noted.\n\nUrban brought out the pills, and Surface demonstrated how to split them.\n\nWhen Venturacci misplaced her hearing aids, Surface lent her a personal amplifier.\n\nHousecall Providers has been specializing in home visits for 20 years.\n\n\u201cThe need has always been significant,\u201d executive director Terri Hobbs said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had a waiting list. We\u2019ve always been recruiting for more clinicians.\u201d\n\nHowever, it can be difficult to make a living seeing patients in their homes. House call providers are reimbursed the same way clinic providers are, on a fee-for-service basis, yet house calls take more time and traveling in between patients. Providers weren\u2019t able to see the volume of patients required to keep the doors open. So the nonprofit\u2019s revenue has long been supplemented by grants and donations.\n\nBut there\u2019s hope that Medicare\u2019s support for house calls through Independence at Home and its value-based payment model is a sign of change, making the profession a more viable option.\n\n\u201cI do see a tide turning and I think there will be health care systems looking at this as a way to better serve these patients,\u201d medical director Dr. Pamela Miner said.\n\nKeeping older patients out of the hospital isn\u2019t just a cost saving. It could also be life-saving.\n\nOlder patients tend not to have great outcomes in hospitals, and they often have to be discharged to a nursing home. The experience also worsens memory problems, Surface said.\n\nVenturacci has no plans to move.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a quiet neighborhood,\u201d Venturacci said. \u201cI enjoy it here.\u201d\n\nSurface turned to Venturacci.\n\n\u201cAt least for the immediate future,\u201d he said, \u201cI see no reason why you\u2019d have to leave.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Statesman Journal, http://www.statesmanjournal.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mary Venturacci is 98 years old and lives by herself in her northeast Salem home.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Mary Venturacci is 98 years old and lives by herself in her northeast Salem home.", "title": "Doctors are bringing house calls back", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/26/doctors-are-bringing-house-calls-back/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/22/16cc17e1af6cf3207c0f6a70670079a9.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/22/16cc17e1af6cf3207c0f6a70670079a9.jpg", "description": "Mary Venturacci is 98 years old and lives by herself in her northeast Salem home.", "card": "summary", "title": "Doctors are bringing house calls back"}, "Author": "SAEROM YOO", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "House call providers are reimbursed the same way clinic providers are, on a fee-for-service basis, yet house calls take more time and traveling in between patients.\nBut there\u2019s hope that Medicare\u2019s support for house calls through Independence at Home and its value-based payment model is a sign of change, making the profession a more viable option.\nFirst-year results of the three-year Affordable Care Act study, Independence at Home, showed that offering house calls to Medicare patients with complex conditions and high needs saved Medicare $25 million.\nHouse calls, which may conjure an image from a different generation, when doctors traveled with black satchels, are gaining recognition for their effectiveness in lowering costs and improving outcomes for the most fragile, complex \u2014 and, in turn, most costly \u2014 health care consumers.\nMuch of it falls on her daughter, Wanda Urban, who helps Venturacci with her health care, medications, grocery shopping and more."}
