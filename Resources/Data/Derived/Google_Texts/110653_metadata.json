Despite growing up in a rural community in Anhui Province, eastern China, 21-year-old Hu Huiyuan has taught herself how to read and write using television subtitles, all the while living with cerebral palsy. Defying all odds, the creative writer has already written more than 60,000 words for her fiction novel with just the use of her left foot.\n\nHuiyuan\u2019s entire life has been about defying the odds, according to her dad Peng and mom Sun. \u201cWhen she was born, the doctors said she wouldn't survive more than a few days, but she did. \u201cThey didn't know what was wrong with her at first, but 10 months later they told us it was cerebral palsy,\u201d said Peng, the Daily Mail reported. \u201cThe only parts of her body she could move were her head and her foot, but she was incredibly determined.\u201d\n\nPatients with cerebral palsy experience partial muscle paralysis that is frequently accompanied by loss of sensation and uncontrollable body movements or tremors. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke says this is caused by the damage to or abnormalities inside the developing brain that disrupt the brain\u2019s ability to control movement and maintain posture and balance. However, Huiyuan\u2019s limited body movement doesn\u2019t get in the way of her learning.\n\n\u201cI teach myself. I'm so fascinated by the opportunities that being able to read presents. Being able to write allows me to communicate with so many more people. I'm not a genius but I'm very focused. When you have a disability like this, you have to learn patience,\u201d Huiyuan said.\n\nHuiyuan isn\u2019t the only cerebral palsy patient to have fulfilled her dream. Wang Qiang, a 29-year-old man with cerebral palsy joined a professional boxing competition when he signed up in the eastern city of Shanghai. Qiang was able to master some basic boxing skills with the help of his dad who clutched his arm and held his legs to help him finish the basic training. He was able to join the boxing competition and complete his first-ever professional boxing game, Shanghaiist reported.\n\nThese two individuals prove the power of tenacity when it comes to fulfilling your dreams.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "chinese woman, cerebral palsy, creative writing, motor development, gross motor skills, partial muscle paralysis, neurological condition, genetic condition, left foot, body", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A 21-year-old woman in China has been writing a fiction novel over 60,000 words using just her left foot.", "title": "Disabled Woman Writes 60,000-Word Novel With Toes [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/hu-huiyuan-chinese-woman-cerebral-palsy-does-creative-writing-left-foot-319862", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/28/chinese-woman-cerebral-palsy-writes-novel-left-foot.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A 21-year-old woman in China has been writing a fiction novel over 60,000 words using just her left foot.", "title": "Disabled Woman Writes 60,000-Word Novel With Toes [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/hu-huiyuan-chinese-woman-cerebral-palsy-does-creative-writing-left-foot-319862", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/28/chinese-woman-cerebral-palsy-writes-novel-left-foot.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/28/chinese-woman-cerebral-palsy-writes-novel-left-foot.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-01-28T17:49:15-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-28T17:49:13-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A 21-year-old woman in China has been writing a fiction novel over 60,000 words using just her left foot."}, "article_summary": "Huiyuan isn\u2019t the only cerebral palsy patient to have fulfilled her dream.\n\u201cThey didn't know what was wrong with her at first, but 10 months later they told us it was cerebral palsy,\u201d said Peng, the Daily Mail reported.\nWang Qiang, a 29-year-old man with cerebral palsy joined a professional boxing competition when he signed up in the eastern city of Shanghai.\nHe was able to join the boxing competition and complete his first-ever professional boxing game, Shanghaiist reported.\nDespite growing up in a rural community in Anhui Province, eastern China, 21-year-old Hu Huiyuan has taught herself how to read and write using television subtitles, all the while living with cerebral palsy."}
