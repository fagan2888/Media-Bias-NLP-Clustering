(REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque)\n\n4498287\n\nThe nation\u2019s 100 senators won\u2019t have any role in approving President Barack Obama\u2019s pending nuclear agreement with Iran\u2019s theocracy because the deal wouldn\u2019t be a treaty, according to White House spokesman Josh Earnest.\n\nEarnest told reporters at a midday press conference that it would be a \u201cimpactful forceful commitment.\u201d\n\nThe negotiations with Iran \u201cseek very serious and firm commitments,\u201d he said.\n\nThey would be \u201cspecific commitments \u2026 a forceful commitment,\u201d he said.\n\nBut 47 of 54 Republican senators disagree with President Barack Obama\u2019s definition of the potential deal, and say it would likely be considered a treaty. They released a letter March 10 warning Iranian officials and Obama that the Senate has the constitutional duty to provide advice and consent to treaties negotiated by the administration.\n\nThe president \u201cshall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur,\u201d says the U.S. Constitution, which Obama swore to protect and serve in 2009 and 2013.\n\nWhen the GOP senators claimed their constitutional power over treaties, senior Democrats \u2014 including Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \u2014 immediately tried to portray the 47 GOP signatories as traitors, Iranian agents and saboteurs.\n\nObama has kept the details of his negotiations secret from the senators. But the potential deal is regarded by critics as evidence that the United States is giving Iran\u2019s agitating Shia theocracy too much leeway.\n\nThe deal is aimed at preventing Iran from being able to build a nuclear weapon in exchange for loosened sanctions, but its framework has yet to address the future of Iran\u2019s nuclear centrifuges and enriched uranium, or the country\u2019s development of long-range missiles. It would likely last 10 years and would likely not prevent funding for jihadi groups or protect Iranians\u2019 human or democratic rights.\n\nObama has said he would continue to push for those priorities after securing the arms deal. He has described the draft deal a way for Iran to gain power and legitimacy in the region.\n\nThe Iran deal is similar to the simple troop-basing agreements signed with allied nations of Japan and South Korea, Earnest insisted.\n\nThe Iranian deal will have \u201ccommitments with the same amount of weight that are struck by the United States and our allies, like Korea and Japan, when it comes to basing agreements about keeping U.S. troops on their soil,\u201d Earnest claimed.\n\nThose basing deals \u201care forceful because they relate to the ability of our men and women in uniform to do their jobs,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Iran deal \u201cis an agreement that is similarly structured\u201d to international agreements that allow multinational seizure of weapons that are being smuggled via international waters, he said.\n\nObama\u2019s dismissive attitude follows his practice of sidelining the Senate\u2019s role in changing his Obamacare system, in reviewing appointments and in setting immigration law.\n\nIn the Iran deal, the 100 senators may have a subsidiary role in future years, Obama\u2019s press secretary granted.\n\n\u201cThe administration \u2026 does acknowledge that Congress at some point, will, by law, have to vote to remove the statutory sanctions that Congress put in place against Iran,\u201d he said.\n\nBut that role won\u2019t begin until years after the \u201ccommitments\u201d are put in place, Earnest declared.\n\n\u201cThe president does not believe that those statutory sanctions should be removed unless and until Iran has demonstrated, over the course of a number of years, that they are actually living up to the commitments they\u2019ve made with the United States,\u201d Earnest said.\n\nEarnest then argued the president was being tougher on Iran that Republican senators.\n\n\u201cCongress is suggesting that they should take a vote on these sanctions far earlier in the process, and the president doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s wise,\u201d he said, adding \u201cthe president thinks, frankly, that we should be tougher on Iran.\u201d\n\nFollow Neil on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Neil Munro",
