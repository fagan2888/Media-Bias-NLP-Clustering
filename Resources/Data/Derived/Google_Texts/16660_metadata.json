The Clinton camp blasted Cruz for reinventing history in order to hide his real record.\n\nWhile campaigning Iowa, Cruz said:\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton embraces abortion on demand in all circumstances up until the moment of birth. Partial-birth abortion with taxpayer funding, with no notification for parents in any circumstances \u2014 91% of Americans say that\u2019s nuts. So what do they do, they try to shift it. The war on women wasn\u2019t that; it was contraceptives. Now listen, I have been a conservative my entire life. I have never met anybody, any conservative who wants to ban contraceptives.\n\n\u2026.\n\nLast I checked we don\u2019t have a rubber shortage in America. When I was in college we had a machine in the bathroom, you put .50 cents in and voila! So yes, anyone who wants contraceptives can access them, but it\u2019s an utterly made-up nonsense issue.\n\n\u2026.\n\nImagine for a second you\u2019re Hillary Clinton. You\u2019re trying to think, \u2018How do I run?\u2019 Well, you can\u2019t run on the economy because we have the lowest percentage of Americans working any year since 1977. You can\u2019t run on Obamacare because millions of people have lost their jobs, lost their health care, lost their doctors, seen their premiums skyrocket. You certainly can\u2019t run on foreign policy because every country you touched as secretary of state is a disaster.\n\nThe Clinton campaign responded by unloading on Cruz.\n\nIn a statement, Hillary for America spokeswoman Christina Reynolds said, \u201cTed Cruz\u2019s colorful comments can\u2019t hide his revisionist history on the sustained Republican effort to restrict access to women\u2019s health care. He threatened to shut down the government to defund Planned Parenthood. He tried to roll back protections that prevent women from being fired for using contraception. He claimed that emergency birth control was an \u2018abortifacient,\u2019 which is both medically and scientifically incorrect. As Cruz tries to police women\u2019s health care decisions and deny a war on women, Hillary Clinton will fight every day to protect them against this seemingly endless Republican assault.\u201d\n\nTed Cruz completely invented his own new reality. The facts are that Cruz supports a personhood amendment to the Constitution that would ban birth control. Ted Cruz thinks contraception is the same as abortion induced drugs.\n\nLess than three months ago, Cruz tried to shut down the government over defunding Planned Parenthood.\n\nTed Cruz has stolen the pages from Donald Trump\u2019s playbook and is now making it up as he goes along. The media never challenges Cruz\u2019s made up \u201cfacts,\u201d so it is up to Democrats like Hillary Clinton to set the record straight.\n\nMitt Romney tried to compulsively lie his way to the presidency in 2012, and that got him routed by President Obama. Republicans have upped the ante and moved from lying to complete detachment from reality in 2016.\n\nIf Cruz wants to pick a fight with Hillary Clinton on contraception, he will live to regret it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Hillary Clinton campaign isn't tolerating Ted Cruz's lies.
