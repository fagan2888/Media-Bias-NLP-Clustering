We will also be able to provide better care coordination as we expand our services and facilities.\u201d\n\nAs part of the donations, the campaign received about two dozen gifts exceeding $1 million, including $5 million from Robert and Louise Deskovick to complete the maternity center.\n\nThe funds will be distributed across 20 projects, programs and services at Morristown Medical Center.\n\nSome of the funds will support ongoing programs including the Carol W. and Julius A. Rippel Breast Center, Deskovick Maternity Center, Sameth Emergency Department and the Project Independence relief fund.\n\nREAD MORE MORRISTOWN MEDICAL NEWS:\n\nMorristown Medical, Madison borough making Morris business news\n\n1,000 tested, cleared in Morristown Medical Center lead exposure\n\nAtlantic Health opens Rockaway location\n\nFirst-time initiatives that will be funded include the Chambers Center for Well Being, Chanin T.
