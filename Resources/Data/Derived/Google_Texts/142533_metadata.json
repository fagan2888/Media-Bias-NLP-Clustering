But the journalist who probably knows Walker best\u2014Wisconsin talk-radio host Charlie Sykes, who estimates he\u2019s interviewed the governor hundreds of times over the years\u2014pointed to one particular harbinger of Walker\u2019s fate: losing Rush Limbaugh.\n\nThe demise of Walker\u2019s presidential hopes indicates the limits big donors face in this race. Even with the support of major players in the Koch fundraising network, Walker\u2019s campaign proved no match for the ultimate power brokers in the Republican base\u2014especially Limbaugh.\n\nEven with drab poll numbers, the national effort to support Walker still could have taken care of him. Recent campaign filings show the Unintimidated PAC that backed him sat on a cool $20 million when he decided to bow out. And Walker was a favorite among the Koch brothers\u2019 network. Just last month, Politico reported that he had won an informal survey of support among major political contributors at a Koch-organized conference. And this past spring, Charles and David Koch signaled that he was their favorite to win the GOP presidential nomination.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t cut it. Somewhere over the summer, Walker seemed to fall out of favor with Limbaugh.\n\n\u201cIf somebody were to go back and look at transcripts of Rush Limbaugh, up until a certain point, he was all into Walker, how great Walker was,\u201d said Sykes. \u201cAnd at some point, he just dropped him and went all in for Trump.\u201d\n\nThe bombastic conservative opiner did spend much of the early part of this year praising Walker. But as Donald Trump soared in talk-radio land\u2014as BuzzFeed detailed last month\u2014the governor faded to black. In June, Limbaugh lauded the governor as the \u201cclosest you can find to any Republican having a plan to deal with Obamacare.\u201d In July, he celebrated Walker, saying he was \u201cthe one guy in the race with a conservative track record.\u201d Two weeks later, a PR firm working for Walker\u2019s campaign blasted out a press release with the subject line \u201cLimbaugh: If Scott Walker\u2019s the nominee, I\u2019m gonna be as enthusiastic as I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d\n\nBut by August, something had changed. Limbaugh was still talking about Walker, all right. But the rapture was gone. Trump released an immigration overhaul proposal that foes of comprehensive immigration reform loved, and Limbaugh was enamored with it. He spent part of his August 17 show tearing into Establishment Trump critics.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think these people have any idea just how angry, frightened, fearful a pretty big majority of the people in this country are,\u201d he said, \u201cthat we are losing the country, and we\u2019re losing it because of immigration, couple other things, but immigration\u2019s the biggie.\u201d\n\nLimbaugh loved Trump\u2019s plan, by the way. And his love for Walker seemed to wilt.\n\n\u201cAsked on Fox & Friends if he gives Trump\u2019s plan a thumbs-up, Walker said: \u2018I haven\u2019t looked at all the details of his, but the things I\u2019ve heard are very similar to the things I mentioned,\u2019\u201d Limbaugh said. \u201cThe me-toos. The me-toos are now starting. Rather than people trying to steal it, people are gonna want to get in on it.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s what happened to Walker: He went from hero to ho-hum\u2014from a conservative conqueror to someone who couldn\u2019t hold a candle to Trump. The governor started as the original conservative winner. He ended as an off-brand Donald. Next to the real estate mogul\u2019s helicopters and wingtips, Walker\u2019s Kohl\u2019s sweaters started to look a little shabby.\n\nThus, his fall turned inexorable. The governor was set to hold a fundraiser in Indianapolis on Monday. Instead, he announced the end of his campaign.\n\nOf course, Trump\u2019s rise alone doesn\u2019t explain Walker\u2019s deflation. The governor had his fair share of goof-ups and gaffes. And in the weeks before he dropped out, his campaign team drew significant media scrutiny.\n\nOn top of that, his poll numbers took a nosedive that must have been embarrassing. After the CNN Republican presidential debate, a national CNN/ORC poll showed him at 0 percent. That\u2019s not a typo. Zero.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

This isn\u2019t the first time Walker has dropped out of a primary; in 2006, he entered the Republican contest to be the state\u2019s gubernatorial nominee. When it became obvious he didn\u2019t have a shot, he bowed out gracefully and then buckled down, making connections and laying the groundwork for a second, successful bid. Repeating that success on a national scale could be dicey.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "woodruffbets"}, "keywords": "Scott Walker, Wisconsin,United States, Politics-Election, 2016 Election, 2016, Republican Party, u.s. poli, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Rush Limbaugh, Koch Brothers", "publicationDate": 201509220115, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "news_keywords": "Scott Walker, Wisconsin United States, PoliticsElection, 2016 Election, 2016 election, Republican Party, US Politics, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Rush Limbaugh", "pageNum": 1, "title": "How Scott Walker Lost Rush Limbaughand His 2016 Presidential Bid", "tags": "entity:person/scott_walker,entity:provinceorstate/wisconsin_united_states,article:politics-election,obsessional:2016-election,entity:event/2016_election,entity:organization/republican_party,topic:politics,entity:person/donald_trump,obsessional:donald-trump,entity:person/rush_limbaugh,entity:person/koch-brothers", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "All the Koch money in the world couldn\u2019t save the Wisconsin governor once the talk-radio king stopped raving about him and jumped on Team Trump.", "title": "How Scott Walker Lost Rush Limbaugh\u2014and His 2016 Presidential Bid", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/21/how-scott-walker-lost-rush-limbaugh-and-his-2016-presidential-bid.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/09/21/how-scott-walker-lost-rush-limbaugh-and-his-2016-presidential-bid/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1442922345075.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "description": "All the Koch money in the world couldn\u2019t save the Wisconsin governor once the talk-radio king stopped raving about him and jumped on Team Trump.", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Betsy Woodruff,Tim Mak", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2015-09-22T01:15:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/tim-makhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/09/21/how-scott-walker-lost-rush-limbaugh-and-his-2016-presidential-bid", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"How Scott Walker Lost Rush Limbaugh\u2014and His 2016 Presidential Bid\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/21/how-scott-walker-lost-rush-limbaugh-and-his-2016-presidential-bid.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/09/21/how-scott-walker-lost-rush-limbaugh-and-his-2016-presidential-bid/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/48097411.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/09/21/how-scott-walker-lost-rush-limbaugh-and-his-2016-presidential-bid\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-09-22T01:15:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Betsy Woodruff|Tim Mak\",\"tags\":[\"scott_walker\",\"wisconsin_united_states\",\"politics-election\",\"2016-election\",\"2016_election\",\"republican_party\",\"politics\",\"donald_trump\",\"donald-trump\",\"rush_limbaugh\",\"koch-brothers\"]}", "authorIds": "/etc/authors/b/betsy-woodruff|/etc/authors/t/tim-mak", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf992\"", "article_summary": "In the coming days, pundits will float a host of explanations for why Scott Walker decided to blow the 2016 Republican presidential primary popsicle stand.\nThe demise of Walker\u2019s presidential hopes indicates the limits big donors face in this race.\nAfter the CNN Republican presidential debate, a national CNN/ORC poll showed him at 0 percent.\n\u201cIf somebody were to go back and look at transcripts of Rush Limbaugh, up until a certain point, he was all into Walker, how great Walker was,\u201d said Sykes.\nAnd this past spring, Charles and David Koch signaled that he was their favorite to win the GOP presidential nomination."}
