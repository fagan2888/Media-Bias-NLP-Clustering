You can\u2019t have a country without borders.\u201d\n\nThe Iowa advertisement finished with a plea for votes. The state\u2019s caucus is 87 days away\n\n\u201cIf the people of Iowa vote for me, you\u2019ll never be disappointed. I don\u2019t disappoint people. I produce,\u201d Trump says.\n\nThe candidate also released a second ad that will air nationally. In it, a spokeswoman highlights Trump\u2019s business experience before breaking down his policies in quick one-liners.\n\nA protestor demonstrates across the street from NBC Studios, where 'Saturday Night Live' is taped, Wednesday, days before Trump hosts the show.

Donald Trump will protect Israel and brutally and quickly cut the head off of ISIS.\u201d\n\nShe continues: \u201cHe is self-funding his campaign. He will only be responsible to the American people \u2014 not special interest or lobbyists.\u201d\n\nThe ads make the same points Trump has previously used in his campaign rallies and media interviews, but the radio medium could expose Trump\u2019s campaign to a wider voting base.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to make America great again. Maybe greater than ever before,\u201d the second ad concludes.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "MEG WAGNER", "twitter": {"description": "Donald Trump is just as aggressive on the radio as he is on the podium.", "title": "Donald Trump releases first radio campaign ads", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/donald-trump-releases-radio-campaign-ads-article-1.2424313", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2424310.1446723198!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/usa-election-trump.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "Donald Trump, Donald Trump 2016, trump president, Iowa caucus, 2016 GOP candidates", "parsely-author": "Meg Wagner", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Donald Trump 2016, trump president, Iowa caucus, 2016 GOP candidates", "nydn_tags": "donald trump, 2016 election, obamacare, isis, immigration", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump, Donald Trump 2016, trump president, Iowa caucus, 2016 GOP candidates", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/donald-trump-releases-radio-campaign-ads-article-1.2424313", "parsely-title": "Donald Trump releases first radio campaign ads", "sailthru.date": "2015-11-05T06:40:21-0500", "sailthru.title": "Donald Trump releases first radio campaign ads", "nydn_section": "Politics", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-11-05T11:40:21", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2424310.1446723198!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/usa-election-trump.jpg", "description": "Donald Trump is just as aggressive on the radio as he is on the podium.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Donald Trump is just as aggressive on the radio as he is on the podium.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-section": "Politics", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Donald Trump is just as aggressive on the radio as he is on the podium.", "title": "Donald Trump releases first radio campaign ads", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/donald-trump-releases-radio-campaign-ads-article-1.2424313", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2424310.1446723198!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/usa-election-trump.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "donald trump, 2016 election, obamacare, isis, immigration", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2424310.1446723198!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/usa-election-trump.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "MEG WAGNER", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS"}, "article_summary": "Donald Trump will protect Israel and brutally and quickly cut the head off of ISIS.\u201dShe continues: \u201cHe is self-funding his campaign.\nDonald Trump is just as aggressive on the radio as he is on the podium.\nThe 2016 GOP candidate released his first set of campaign ads Thursday, two wide-ranging radio slots that attacked his rivals and boasted his anti-immigration, pro-veteran platform.\n(Kathy Willens/AP)SEE IT: LATINO KIDS HIT BACK AT DONALD TRUMP IN HILARIOUS VIDEO\u201cHe went on to build one of the world\u2019s most iconic brands and companies which employs thousands of people,\u201d the woman says.\nMaybe greater than ever before,\u201d the second ad concludes."}
