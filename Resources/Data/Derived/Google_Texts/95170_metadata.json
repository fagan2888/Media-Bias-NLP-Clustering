(Photo: Chris Caldwell / The Spectrum & Daily News)Buy Photo\n\nThere is a concern about bus drivers in the Washington County School District and it\u2019s coming from both the district and the parental side.\n\nHiring and keeping quality bus drivers is an issue WCSD Transportation Director Launi Schmutz-Harden is trying to address.\n\nIt\u2019s a problem she said lies within the 30-hour rule of the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare, which makes employers give benefits to anyone who works at least 30 hours.\n\n\u201cWe gave people positions when we had money to give benefits and other than that they were able to work 40, 45 hours a week,\u201d Schmutz-Harden said. \u201cWhen the 29 hours came out, the school district couldn\u2019t afford it so they were bound to 29 (hours).\u201d\n\nAccording to Schmutz-Harden, bus driver salaries start at $14.64 with less than half of the district\u2019s school bus drivers being full time.\n\nSchmutz-Harden said she has asked businesses in town to partner with the school district to provide the drivers with additional jobs. She added the district has started working with the city to share employee drivers and has had group homes share employees in the past.\n\nOne example would be SunTran employees who also work part time as school bus drivers and vice versa.\n\nHowever, this can be a catch-22 because if those part-time employees find full-time jobs with benefits, they are more likely to leave their school bus job, Schmutz-Harden said.\n\n\"Most Utah school districts seem to be struggling to maintain enough school bus drivers,\u201d wrote Murrell Martin, state director of student transportation at the Utah State Office of Education. \u201cThe 30-hour rule from the Affordable Care Act seems to have limited what many districts are able to offer drivers, and it is said to be one of the biggest impacts to driver shortages.\"\n\nOut of 130 buses, there are 80 buses that run daily that take students to and from school within Washington County.\n\nThere are approximately 9,140 eligible students within the district, with an average cost of $409.83 per student from the state allotment of $3,910,876, according to figures from the USOE sent to Wayne Reese, Cache County Utah transportation and logistics administrator. The district is audited and tracked on its expenses by the USOE and the legislature with expenses being cost per mile and minute.\n\nThere is also the issue of training, set by the USOE, which can take three weeks to a month to complete and before a license is issued.\n\nSchmutz-Harden said it\u2019s that slow process along with a job that usually lasts only nine months out of the year that can be a deterrent for someone needing an immediate job to cover expenses.\n\n\u201cThe people that we are losing now are people that are retiring or moving,\u201d she said. \u201cThe first couple of years after the 29-hour (rule) was when people left for benefits in another job.\u201d\n\nSome employees can receive a retention bonus put in place where they are paid $500 or $1,000 if they work a certain number of hours in the summer. But insurance comes into play here as the district is only covered if drivers are using the buses for school-related transportation.\n\nOn the parental side, there have been worries after children have been left standing at their bus stop with no pick up.\n\nJen Cloward had this exact situation play out with her own children last year. She said there had been at least two incidents where the bus did not come to pick up her children to take them to Lava Ridge Intermediate.\n\nShe added that other times her children had gotten out of school early and would have had to wait for the high school to let out before a bus was available.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anybody trying to make any solutions to the problem. They just kind of brush it off,\u201d Cloward said. \u201cI just think they\u2019re setting themselves up for something serious if they don\u2019t change the situation.\u201d\n\nNewly-hired bus driver Robert Cox pointed out that similar situations could be a result of substitute bus drivers within the district who do not have a regular route and can be called to pick up students in areas they have never been before.\n\nA substitute himself, Cox said his routine may consist of driving a local route or getting a call at 5 a.m. to be in Apple Valley that morning. He said he tries to plug routes into his GPS or drive the roads beforehand if he can.\n\n\u201cSometimes that\u2019s a challenge if I haven\u2019t driven the route before,\u201d Cox said. \u201cI might be a few minutes early, I might be a few minutes late, but I\u2019m learning that route and the different things about it.\u201d\n\nSchmutz-Harden pointed out that buses also have a GPS that tells the speed of the bus and when it makes each stop. She said the district would like for parents to call officials if a student is not picked up so they can make alternative arrangements.\n\nSchmutz-Harden added the district also have run into a problem when it comes to hiring and training, noting it takes a unique person who has patience with children as well as a clean driving record and background.\n\n\u201cNot everybody is cut out to be a bus driver and some people don\u2019t even last the first training period,\u201d said Ken Mickelson, a WCSD bus driver for nine years. \u201cThis is a job that people have to go into understanding that it\u2019s not going to be a full-time job they probably won\u2019t get benefits.\u201d\n\nMickelson, who is retired, has about nine runs a day. He said the job appealed to him because he didn\u2019t need the longer hours that other people might be looking for.\n\nRoy Wanlass, who is also retired, said when drivers are getting an hourly wage and only working a few hours in the morning and evening, he can understand the difficulty in keeping employees if a full-time position opens elsewhere.\n\nWanlass said he loves his job driving the school buses, noting the shorter hours and days off make it ideal for someone like him who doesn\u2019t need the job to make a living.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for these districts to operate under the budgets they get,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand what their struggle is.\u201d\n\nAnd even though Cox is only a substitute, he has started a regular bus run every Tuesday and Thursday for special needs students.\n\nHe said he started doing the route when the district couldn\u2019t find a driver to drive it. He also helps out with other runs such as driving sports teams and choirs to events.\n\n\u201cBecause of the money issues in the school, they don\u2019t have the capability of having a whole fleet of drivers who are full-time,\u201d Cox said. \u201cWhen you drive a bus for the most part it\u2019s not a full-time job\u2026that makes it difficult to keep a bus driver.\u201d\n\nFollow Nichole Osinski on Twitter, @nrosinski, and on Facebook at www.facebook.com/osinskireporter.
