Two games, two W\u2019s going into Sunday night\u2019s contest at the Pepsi Center.\n\nNot this time.\n\nThe Nuggets put forth their best full 48-minute effort in some time, and that took the game into the fourth quarter with the outcome still to be decided. But when it was, it was the Pelicans who had just enough answers to pull out a 99-92 victory.\n\n\u201cI must say that we had better effort tonight, definitely,\u201d Nuggets coach Brian Shaw said.\n\nStill, the Nuggets\u2019 home losing streak was stretched to 10 games.\n\nThe Pelicans \u2014 minus their star, Anthony Davis \u2014 carved out a small lead in the fourth quarter and then just kept it. There were not huge deficits in the game, just a lot of back and forth throughout. But the Pelicans were quicker to the loose balls and were able to avoid a scoring drought because they got to the rim many times.\n\nThe Nuggets simply could not overcome that. A game after they allowed 50 points in the paint, the Pelicans got 42 points themselves, including all of their first 16 points of the game. Whether it was a post-up or a drive into the lane, the result was almost always a made bucket. And that helped the Pelicans overcome a shot-attempt deficit of 18. They made the most of the ones they got.\n\nNuggets Mailbag: Pose a question for Christopher Dempsey\n\nThe Nuggets used volume to combat another frigid night from the field. They shot 40 percent, and did hit nine 3-pointers, but consistent shot making still eluded them.\n\nThe Pelicans\u2019 backcourt gave the Nuggets the most fits. The duo of Eric Gordon and Tyreke Evans combined to score 40 points. Center Omer Asik grabbed 16 of the Pelicans\u2019 44 rebounds in the game.\n\nThe Nuggets, meanwhile, got another good performance from newcomer Will Barton (16 points, 10 rebounds) and mainstay Danilo Gallinari (21 points). Randy Foye started the game and had his best performance in a long while, hitting five 3-pointers on his way to 19 points.\n\nBut none of it was enough.\n\nPHOTOS: Denver Nuggets vs. New Orleans Pelicans, March 1, 2015\n\n\u201cNew Orleans won four in a row before they came in here, so I think they just know how to get the job done,\u201d forward Kenneth Faried said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in this rut and trying to get this monkey off our back, so I guess when you\u2019re winning four in a row you know how to win games and when you\u2019re them \u2014 we have to find a way to win them.\u201d\n\nSo the Nuggets go into Tuesday\u2019s game, the finale of this five-game homestand, still searching for that home victory.\n\n\u201cEveryone is sick of losing. We are all trying to get a win,\u201d Barton said. \u201cWe are on a losing streak right now, but we are trying to find our way out of this funk. We will do it with the type of effort tonight and build off it.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets fall to Pelicans, drop 10th straight at Pepsi Center", "title": "Nuggets fall to Pelicans, drop 10th straight at Pepsi Center", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/01/nuggets-fall-to-pelicans-drop-10th-straight-at-pepsi-center/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150301__nuggets-pelicansp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150301__nuggets-pelicansp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-01T21:48:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T15:34:57+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But no matter how bad things have gotten this season, they\u2019d always been able to beat the New Orleans Pelicans.\nNuggets Mailbag: Pose a question for Christopher DempseyThe Nuggets used volume to combat another frigid night from the field.\nBut when it was, it was the Pelicans who had just enough answers to pull out a 99-92 victory.\nPHOTOS: Denver Nuggets vs. New Orleans Pelicans, March 1, 2015\u201cNew Orleans won four in a row before they came in here, so I think they just know how to get the job done,\u201d forward Kenneth Faried said.\n\u201cWe are on a losing streak right now, but we are trying to find our way out of this funk."}
