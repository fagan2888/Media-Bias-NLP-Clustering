Instead the Guv simply buried the Polluter Protection Act in a list of several bills signed late last Friday when the media had already pretty much packed up shop for the week. All in all, it was a fitting way to usher in a new and hugely destructive law that was crafted in secret by corporate lobbyists and rammed through the General Assembly with as little public input as possible.\n\nThe Monday newsletter of the League of Conservation Voters explains once more what\u2019s in this mess of a new law:\n\nGov. Pat McCrory on Friday left no doubt where he stands. By signing HB 765, the 2015 \u201crules reform\u201d bill now widely known as the Polluter Protection Act, McCrory acted to protect polluters at the cost of greatly increased danger to the health, clean water, and clean air of all North Carolinians. \u201cWe are greatly disappointed with Governor McCrory\u2019s actions today. We had shared our concerns with the Governor, emphasizing that nothing in this bill was essential but much was harmful. We\u2019re saddened to see our leadership give a green light to such egregious, anti-environmental actions,\u201d said Carrie Clark, Executive Director of NCLCV. McCrory acted in spite of receiving more than 8,600 emails and hundreds of phone calls from concerned citizens urging him to veto the bill. A joint letter to McCrory from 15 citizen conservation organizations (including NCLCV) explained the bill\u2019s dangers and urged a veto. Major newspapers around the state joined in editorializing against the bill. \u201cThis bill undoes so much of the progress our state has made in the last decade to clean up our air and water, build healthier communities, and create a stronger workforce. Now, using false claims that these regulations were holding back business, our Governor and legislative leaders have allowed polluters to have their way with our natural resources and the future prosperity of our state,\u201d remarked Dan Crawford, NCLCV Director of Governmental Relations. \u201cGovernor McCrory has simply reaffirmed his position of siding with corporate polluters over the interests of North Carolinians and the future of our state.\u201d As previously outlined in CIB, here are three of the worst problems created by this bill: The bill\u2019s \u201cpolluter protection\u201d provision (known euphemistically as the \u201cenvironmental self-audit\u201d) excuses permit-holders who violate environmental limits from civil penalties for their offenses, if they self-report the violations. This encourages carelessness by air and water pollution dischargers. And it lets the polluters keep evidence of the audit discovering the pollution secret from civil suits and the public.\n\nThe bill cuts back state protections for isolated wetlands and eliminates state protections for intermittent streams (streams which flow in an established channel but only for part of the year). These waters are critical to wildlife and to protecting clean water in other streams and rivers across the state throughout the year. <\n\nThe bill will require the state\u2019s air quality protection agency to shut down about half of its air quality monitors, creating willful blind spots in our monitoring network and making effective regulation of air pollution much more difficult. HB 765 helps to ensure that environmental protection will be a major concern in the 2016 election cycle getting underway now.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "HB 765 helps to ensure that environmental protection will be a major concern in the 2016 election cycle getting underway now.\nThese waters are critical to wildlife and to protecting clean water in other streams and rivers across the state throughout the year.\nInstead the Guv simply buried the Polluter Protection Act in a list of several bills signed late last Friday when the media had already pretty much packed up shop for the week.\nA joint letter to McCrory from 15 citizen conservation organizations (including NCLCV) explained the bill\u2019s dangers and urged a veto.\nBy signing HB 765, the 2015 \u201crules reform\u201d bill now widely known as the Polluter Protection Act, McCrory acted to protect polluters at the cost of greatly increased danger to the health, clean water, and clean air of all North Carolinians."}
