And OPK stock was sailing for most of 2013, as biotechs and other health care stocks were all booming thanks to recent drug approvals, mergers within the industry, and a feeling that Obamacare would increase revenues from millions of newly insured consumers. OPK stock climbed from $5 at the start of the year to a closing high of $11.63 on Dec. 9.\n\nBut suddenly the bottom dropped out. As the accompanying OPK stock chart shows, Opko Health slid 26% lower in just a few days, currently going for under $9.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nWhat Stalled OPK Stock?\n\nWhile this is not uncommon for a speculative biotech stock, it was not a poor earnings report, FDA rejection, nor an analyst downgrade that caused the swoon. Instead, OPK stock got hammered by a brutally negative article entitled \u201cOpko Health: The Placebo Effect.\u201d It was published by Lakewood Capital Management \u2014 a hedge fund that has publicly acknowledged a very large short position on shares of OPK stock.\n\nThe Lakewood article alleged that Opko Health was \u201cgrossly overvalued,\u201d and challenged the worth and potential of several of its pipeline products. It suggested that the company might never make a profit and that OPK stock is worth no more than a quarter of the current price. The article even attacked the most promising phase 3 drug in the Opko Health pipeline \u2014 Rayaldy, which treats stage 3 and 4 kidney disease.\n\nImmediately after the 45-page report was published, investors fled OPK stock in droves. But Dr. Philip Frost \u2014 the billionaire who owns Opko Health \u2014 didn\u2019t just defend his company a few days later. He also supported his position by purchasing another 1.2 million shares at prices ranging from $9.44 to $10.90 over a two-day period \u2026 and that\u2019s on top of the millions of shares of OPK stock he already bought on the open market throughout 2013,.\n\nHow to Play OPK Stock Now\n\nSo what should investors in OPK stock do now \u2014 sell, hold or buy more shares at depleted prices?\n\nThe answer to that question depends on your tolerance for risk and your time horizon. OPK stock has always been extremely volatile, and will most likely continue to be. Aggressive swing and option traders could find a great deal of value in OPK stock at present levels, especially if Dr. Frost continues his insider purchases.\n\nDr Frost said in a recent interview that he continues to buy OPK stock because he believes the product line will eventually create tremendous appreciation. Plus, Frost has never sold any of the shares of Opko Health he purchased.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The bottom recently dropped out for Opko Health.
