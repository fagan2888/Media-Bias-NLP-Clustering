Have you forgotten what a nightmare this branch of health insurance was before?\n\n\n\nTo jog your memories, I dug out an article on the subject I did back in 2008. Its title: \"On Their Own: Far From a Remedy, Insurance for Individuals is a World of Pain\".\n\nIt featured the stories of:\n\nThe Georgia real estate agent whose group health plan was folding and who couldn\u2019t find replacement insurance unless it excluded coverage of her $1,700-a-month rheumatoid arthritis medication, without which she would quickly become disabled.\n\nThe Arizona small business owner who could only find insurance if it excluded coverage of anti-rejection drugs he was taking for a successful liver transplant he\u2019d had years before.\n\nThe Virginia early retiree who discovered he was uninsurable at any price because of his diabetes, despite the fact that he kept it under perfect control.\n\nThe Indiana lawyer whose longtime insurance company, following standard industry practice, deliberately shrunk his plan\u2019s risk pool to drive his premium up to more than $4,200\u2014a month!\u2014and him out of the plan.\n\nThe article also featured the resuts of a survey we did, which found that 76 percent of uninsured respondents said they couldn't afford an individual plan. And the ones who were \"lucky\" enough to have this type of coverage didn't like it very much because it was more expensive and had more limited coverage than health plans available through an employer.\n\n\n\nBecause of the new health care law people like these, who did nothing wrong except to have the bad luck to be stranded in the individual market, can now get health coverage at a price they can afford. Insurers can\u2019t turn them down or exclude coverage of the treatments they need the most. They can\u2019t slice and dice risk pools to drive longtime policyholders away. They can\u2019t charge them more because of pre-existing conditions.\n\nI\u2019m not the only person to call attention to this. Jonathan Cohn, writing in the New Republic, points out that \u201cThe most egregious insurance company abuses\u2014rescinding policies for people who get sick, failing to pay for services that beneficiaries assumed were covered\u2014usually come from the non-group market.\u201d\n\nSo the next time you hear about someone whose individual coverage is being canceled because of the new health care law, consider that the new law is making this market work better for the vast majority of people who are either already in it or need to be in it because they have no other place to get covered.\n\n\n\nGot a question for our health insurance expert?
