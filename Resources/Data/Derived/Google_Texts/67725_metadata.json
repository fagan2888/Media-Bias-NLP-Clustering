Though the average annual cost of auto insurance rose from $798 in 2011 to $815 in 2012, according to a December 2014 report from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, AAA notes that costs differ based on the driver. The average low-risk driver with a clean driving record for a policy with a $500 deductible for collision and a $100 deductible for comprehensive coverage paid $1,023, down from $1,029 in 2012, according to AAA.\n\n\u201cAuto insurance expenditures have remained relatively stable when compared to other life essentials, such as housing, food and health care,\u201d said Robert Hartwig, economist and president of the institute. \u201cPeople are spending about the same for auto insurance as they did a few years ago, adjusted for inflation. Meanwhile, other expenses continue to eat up bigger portions of their budget.\u201d\n\nBut only if they can keep their driving record fairly clean, or at least avoid the moving violations that insurance companies hate most. Laura Adams, senior analyst for insurance information and pricing site, says that only 19% of Americans who got a traffic ticket in the past five years are paying more for car insurance as a result. That's down from 31% in 2013, with drivers ages 30 to 49 picking up the most tickets and drivers 18 to 49 the most likely to see their insurance rates increase after getting a ticket.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "main", "description": "Driving without a license or not buckling up won't cost you all that much, but the difference between careless and reckless driving could triple your rates.", "author": "Jason Notte", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "Driving without a license or not buckling up won't cost you all that much, but the difference between careless and reckless driving could triple your rates.", "title": "Here's What Traffic Tickets Actually Do to Your Auto Insurance Costs", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/heres-what-traffic-tickets-actually-do-to-your-auto-insurance-costs", "image": {"width": 600, "secure_url": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/trafficticketandcop.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/trafficticketandcop.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Insurance", "keywords": "insurance, auto insurance, car insurance, moving violations, speeding, DUI, DWI, reckless driving, careless driving, driving without a license, traffic violations", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Insurance", "tag": "traffic violations", "published_time": "2015-05-08T08:28Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/1145802"}, "date": "2015-05-08T08:28Z", "contentType": "article", "guid": 13140019, "twitter": {"description": "Driving without a license or not buckling up won't cost you all that much, but the difference between careless and reckless driving could triple your rates.", "title": "Here's What Traffic Tickets Actually Do to Your Auto Insurance Costs", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/heres-what-traffic-tickets-actually-do-to-your-auto-insurance-costs", "image": {"src": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/trafficticketandcop.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/trafficticketandcop.jpg"}, "site": "@mainstr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "insurance, auto insurance, car insurance, moving violations, speeding, DUI, DWI, reckless driving, careless driving, driving without a license, traffic violations"}, "article_summary": "The Insurance Information Institute notes that spending on auto insurance has held remarkably steady in recent years.\n\u201cPeople are spending about the same for auto insurance as they did a few years ago, adjusted for inflation.\nADVERTISEMENTNEW YORK (MainStreet) \u2013 Getting a traffic ticket isn't great under any circumstance, but your insurance company thinks you should be sweating some offenses more than others.\nLaura Adams, senior analyst for insurance information and pricing site, says that only 19% of Americans who got a traffic ticket in the past five years are paying more for car insurance as a result.\nThough the average annual cost of auto insurance rose from $798 in 2011 to $815 in 2012, according to a December 2014 report from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, AAA notes that costs differ based on the driver."}
