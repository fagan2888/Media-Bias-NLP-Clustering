Puzder, CEO of the parent company of Carl\u2019s Jr., has announced he\u2019s investing in machines in part because the American government, he says, is making it too difficult to afford employees. Puzder, who was an economic adviser to Mitt Romney, contends that the costs of President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act to employers has led to the cutting of workers\u2019 hours across the country.\n\nPuzder also has crusaded against raising the minimum wage\u2014and has said fast-food restaurant managers prefer their \u201cstature\u201d to the economic benefits of overtime pay. (These managers are not paid for any overtime they work.)\n\nCKE Restaurants Inc. owns several fast-food chains and claims on its website to employ over 70,000 people in the United States. However, according to The Nation, which cites a Securities and Exchange Commission report, the figure is closer to 20,000.\n\nThe CKE website asserts that the corporation brought in annual revenue of $1.3 billion for a year that ended in January. It goes on to say, \u201cAdjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the year were expected to be between $195 million and $197 million.\u201d Even so, Puzder hopes to install kiosk machines to shed jobs and generate more profit.\n\nBusiness Insider reports:\n\nPuzder\u2019s interest in an employee-free restaurant, which he says would be possible only if the company found time as Hardee\u2019s works on its northeastern expansion, has been driven by rising minimum wages across the U.S. \u201cWith government driving up the cost of labor, it\u2019s driving down the number of jobs,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores, but in restaurants.\u201d Puzder has been an outspoken advocate against raising the minimum wage, having written two op-eds for The Wall Street Journal on how a higher minimum wage would lead to reduced employment opportunities. \u201cThis is the problem with Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage,\u201d says Puzder. \u201cDoes it really help if Sally makes $3 more an hour if Suzie has no job?\u201d As a result, he and others in the fast-food business are investing big in automation. \u201cIf you\u2019re making labor more expensive, and automation less expensive\u2014this is not rocket science,\u201d says Puzder. ... [Puzder says of machines,] \u201cThey\u2019re always polite, they always upsell, they never take a vacation, they never show up late, there\u2019s never a slip-and-fall, or an age, sex, or race discrimination case. ...\u201d\n\nThe Economic Policy Institute, in a 2014 post, reported a yearly leap in profits of over 30 percent for CKE Restaurants. The executive makes more in one day ($17,192) than one of his minimum-wage employees working full time makes in a year ($15,080), The Nation reported last year.\n\nAnother reason Puzder gives for wanting to install kiosks is that \u201c[m]illennials like not seeing people.\u201d\n\n\u2014Posted by Donald Kaufman\n\nMore Below the Ad", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "affordable care act, andrew f. puzder, bernie sanders, carl's jr., cke restaurants inc., economic policy institute, hillary clinton, minimum wage, mitt romney, president obama, securities and exchange commission", "og": {"site_name": "Truthdig", "description": "Machines are \u201calways polite, they always upsell, they never take a vacation, they never show up late, there\u2019s never a slip-and-fall, or an age, sex, or race discrimination case,\u201d says the parent company\u2019s $17,192-a-day chief executive.\n - 2016/03/18", "title": "Carl\u2019s Jr. Wants to Replace Human Workers With Bots to Save Money and Increase Profits", "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/eartotheground/item/carls_jr_wants_to_replace_human_workers_with_bots_to_save_money_and_increa", "image": {"width": 390, "identifier": "http://www.truthdig.com/images/eartothegrounduploads/Carls_Jr._390_.jpg", "height": 260}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Machines are \u201calways polite, they always upsell, they never take a vacation, they never show up late, there\u2019s never a slip-and-fall, or an age, sex, or race discrimination case,\u201d says the parent company\u2019s $17,192-a-day chief executive.", "title": "Carl\u2019s Jr. Wants to Replace Human Workers With Bots to Save Money and Increase Profits | Truthdig: Drilling Beneath the Headlines", "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/eartotheground/item/carls_jr_wants_to_replace_human_workers_with_bots_to_save_money_and_increa/", "image": {"width": 390, "identifier": "http://www.truthdig.com/images/eartothegrounduploads/Carls_Jr._390_.jpg", "height": 260}, "creator": "@truthdig", "site": "@truthdig"}, "fb": {"app_id": 319814091404244}, "keywords": "Truthdig, Carl\u2019s Jr. Wants to Replace Human Workers With Bots to Save Money and Increase Profits, affordable care act, andrew f. puzder, bernie sanders, carl's jr., cke restaurants inc., economic policy institute, hillary clinton, minimum wage, mitt romney, president obama, securities and exchange commission", "article": {"tag": "affordable care act, andrew f. puzder, bernie sanders, carl's jr., cke restaurants inc., economic policy institute, hillary clinton, minimum wage, mitt romney, president obama, securities and exchange commission", "published_time": "2016-03-18T21:45:07-08:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-22T17:02:08-08:00"}, "description": "Machines are \u201calways polite, they always upsell, they never take a vacation, they never show up late, there\u2019s never a slip-and-fall, or an age, sex, or race discrimination case,\u201d says the parent company\u2019s $17,192-a-day chief executive.\n - 2016/03/18"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis is the problem with Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage,\u201d says Puzder.\nCKE Restaurants Inc. owns several fast-food chains and claims on its website to employ over 70,000 people in the United States.\nPuzder also has crusaded against raising the minimum wage\u2014and has said fast-food restaurant managers prefer their \u201cstature\u201d to the economic benefits of overtime pay.\n...\u201dThe Economic Policy Institute, in a 2014 post, reported a yearly leap in profits of over 30 percent for CKE Restaurants.\nAnother reason Puzder gives for wanting to install kiosks is that \u201c[m]illennials like not seeing people.\u201d\u2014Posted by Donald KaufmanMore Below the Ad"}
