Republican lawmakers in Montana have decided that 70,000 Montanans will have to go without health care.

Though the state has a Democratic governor, both houses of the Montana legislature are controlled by Republicans, and they are refusing to advance the governor’s Medicaid expansion bill, according to Kaiser Health News. The expansion would cover the 70,000 Montanans who fall between the cracks in the Affordable Care Act by making too much to currently qualify for Medicaid and too little to be eligible for subsidies.

But the Republicans were unmoved by the more than 200 Montanans who spoke on behalf of doctors, nurses, the hospital association, low-income clinics, Native American tribes, and the state public health association — all in favor of the expansion.

The expansion would help working families, veterans and military families, increase low-cost preventive care, and reduce the leading cause of bankruptcy: medical debt. And it’s funded by the federal government, saving Montana money and making it economically competitive with neighboring states.

Sounds like a winner doesn’t it? Even the state chamber of commerce backs the expansion, but the House Republicans chose to listen to a small handful of opponents including two staffers from Koch brothers-funded Americans for Prosperity. They couldn’t care less about the poor or their health.

More than 22 million women have access to healthcare in this nation thanks to Medicaid, according to the National Women’s Law Center, and two-thirds of adult Medicaid recipients are women. Medicaid is vital to the health of women and their families. In 2014, approximately 29 million children received health coverage through Medicaid.

Medicaid expansion has worked, and Republicans need to stop being the real death panels and pulling the plug on people who are hanging on by a thread.
