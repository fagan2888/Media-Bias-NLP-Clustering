Cate Blanchett chomped Xanax like they were Tic Tacs, Matthew McConaughey did his yeoman\u2019s share of coke, and \u201cAmerican Hustle\u201d taught us all that drugged-out crime really does pay.\n\nBut 2014 looks different. A lot different. Perhaps it\u2019s five years of President Obama. The economy is worse, not better. All those 20-somethings whom millions of Americans have been putting through college the past half-decade are moving back home. Obamacare is turning into Obamascare \u2014 no one feels safe, secure anymore. Not much hope for \u201chope and change.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: CURL: Fear and trembling for Democrats on Capitol Hill\n\nSo, right on cue, the movies are changing. The excess of the 1980s? Neurotic New Yorkers? Not so much. God is making a comeback, and so are the Bible, faith, religion.\n\nFirst came \u201cSon of God,\u201d which opened late last month. The makers of the History Channel\u2019s hit 2013 miniseries \u201cThe Bible,\u201d which averaged 11 million viewers an episode and was America\u2019s most watched cable show last year, turned the series into a surefire Hollywood hit. (I caught the movie on opening day: At 1 p.m. on a Friday, some 200 people turned out. Some wiped away tears in the final Crucifixion scenes.)\n\nLater this month comes \u201cGod\u2019s Not Dead.\u201d \u201cPresent-day college freshman and devout Christian, Josh Wheaton, finds his faith challenged on his first day of philosophy class by the dogmatic and argumentative Professor Radisson,\u201d says one description. \u201cRadisson begins class by informing students that they will need to disavow, in writing, the existence of God on that first day, or face a failing grade.\u201d\n\nIn a college shocker, Wheaton disagrees, and then \u201cmust prove God\u2019s existence by presenting well-researched, intellectual arguments and evidence over the course of the semester, and engage Radisson in a head-to-head debate in front of the class.\u201d\n\nThe movie looks, from its trailer, to capture everything we hear about modern-day colleges. Instead, this time, one student takes issue with the nonstop pablum offered by liberal professors and goes head to head with the atheist professor. (It being a Christian movie, it\u2019s safe to put your money on God in this one.) Willie Robertson of \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d has a role in the movie, which is sure to irk the mainstream media.\n\nBy month\u2019s end comes \u201cNoah,\u201d a nine-figure-budgeted blockbuster sure to stoke the embers. Even before its release, the film is causing a stir. Just last week, the producers put out this disclaimer: \u201cThe film is inspired by the story of Noah. While artistic license has been taken, we believe that this film is true to the essence, values, and integrity of a story that is a cornerstone of faith for millions of people worldwide.\u201d\n\nIn April comes \u201cHeaven Is for Real.\u201d Based on The New York Times best-seller, the film features a small-town dad (Greg Kinnear) whose 4-year-old son claims to have visited heaven when he \u201cdies\u201d on the operating table. He meets his miscarried sister and a great-grandfather he never knew. He goes on \u201cto describe the horse that only Jesus could ride, about how \u2018really big\u2019 God and his chair are, and how the Holy Spirit \u2018shoots down power\u2019 from heaven to help us,\u201d says one description.\n\nIn June, there\u2019s \u201cLeft Behind,\u201d which \u201cfocuses on the hours immediately following the Rapture, when millions of people vanish, and the ones left behind face the chaos around them.\u201d \u201cExodus\u201d comes in December. It stars Christian Bale as Moses \u201cleading the Israelites from the grips of slavery at the hands of the Egyptian Pharaoh.\u201d\n\nNext year, too. In 2015 comes \u201cMary, Mother of Christ.\u201d Rumors are swirling that there\u2019s a Cain and Abel movie coming from Will Smith and a Pontius Pilate picture starring Brad Pitt.\n\nNow, perhaps more than ever, or at least of late, people are looking for some sort of meaning. The promise of the Obama years have clearly not panned out. Maybe there\u2019s something more.\n\nThomas Keating, an associate theater professor at Charleston Southern University, told The Post and Courier that Tinseltown is coming around. \u201cHollywood realizes that there is a market for these Christian films where they might have been reluctant in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they are willing to make an investment.\u201d\n\nAnd so are Americans. Looks like 2014 is going to be the year of God. And maybe that\u2019s about time.\n\n\u2022 Joseph Curl covered the White House and politics for a decade for The Washington Times and is now editor of the Drudge Report.
