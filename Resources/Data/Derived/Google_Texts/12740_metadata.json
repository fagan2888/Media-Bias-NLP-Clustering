Often, he noted, people point to the aging population, or doctors ordering too many tests and treatments, as the main drivers of soaring health care spending.\n\n\"I think the origin of that misperception comes from the politicizing of the issue,\" said Moses, who is also chairman of Alerion Institute, a Virginia-based consulting firm.\n\nThe new study, reported in the Nov. 13 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, is an attempt to add more actual data to the debate.\n\nIn the current political climate, Moses said, \"rational discussions based on valid information\" are hard to come by.\n\n\"But the fact is,\" he said, \"we spend more on health care than other developed countries, and the U.S. still lags behind in outcomes.\"\n\nLife expectancy is a case in point, Moses said. It's improving in the United States, but not as fast as it is in other developed countries.\n\nThe reasons for the poorer outcomes are not completely clear, and probably complicated, Moses noted. But, he said, the bottom line is, \"U.S. patients should be demanding a much higher degree of service than they're getting.\"\n\nFor the study, Moses's team analyzed a range of public data sources to look at trends in health care spending since 1980.\n\nWhat they found counters some conventional beliefs. First, price increases have driven the increase in health care costs since 2000. The price of drugs and devices has risen by about 4 percent a year, on average. Hospital charges have shown a similar increase. Meanwhile, administrative costs -- what doctors and hospitals expend getting payments from insurers and patients -- have gone up by nearly 6 percent each year.\n\nAnd \"market forces\" don't come into play. \"Patients never see 90 percent of these costs,\" Moses said, and even doctors may not know how much a treatment costs. With medical devices, like implantable heart devices, for example, hospitals sign confidentiality agreements with manufacturers that prevent them from sharing price information -- and knowing whether they are getting a good deal or not.\n\nAnother finding that may surprise many patients: Americans have been paying for an increasingly smaller share of their medical care over time.\n\nIn 2011, consumers footed the bill for 11 percent of national health care costs (in the form of insurance premiums, co-pays and other spending). That was down from 23 percent in 1980.\n\nAnd while there is a lot of worry about the aging baby boomers straining the health care system, right now it's not the elderly breaking the bank. Chronic conditions among people younger than 65 -- from heart disease to high blood pressure to back pain -- account for two-thirds of health care costs, the study found.\n\n\"Chronic illness is a problem for everyone, not just the elderly,\" Moses said. For the general public, he added, that's another reminder to follow a healthy lifestyle to reduce your chances of developing common health problems like high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.\n\nBut no one is saying that healthy diets and exercise are going to fix the U.S. health care problem. Whether the Affordable Care Act will make a dent remains to be seen, Moses said.\n\nDr. Joshua Sharfstein, the secretary of Maryland's health department, said it might. The law gives more flexibility to states to find \"innovative ways\" to cut costs, according to Sharfstein, who co-wrote an editorial published with the study.\n\nIn Maryland, Sharfstein said, an independent commission has been setting hospital prices since the 1970s. And now his state is working on a plan that would keep hospital spending from growing faster than the economy. It's also supposed to decrease incentives for hospitals to perform more procedures, and instead reward them for better quality of care.", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"Staying active, losing weight, managing your blood sugar and not smoking can help prevent heart disease.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "Major survey of U.S. health care trends yields surprises", "zone": "health/articles", "og": {"url": "http://health.usnews.com/health-news/news/articles/2013/11/12/soaring-prices-not-demand-behind-massive-hike-in-us-health-spending", "type": "article", "site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Major survey of U.S. health care trends yields surprises", "title": "Soaring Prices, Not Demand, Behind Massive Hike in U.S. Health Spending"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Major survey of U.S. health care trends yields surprises", "card": "summary", "title": "Soaring Prices, Not Demand, Behind Massive Hike in U.S. Health Spending - US News"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "news", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "keywords": "insurance,HealthDay,health  ,hospitals,prescription drugs,heart disease,doctors,senior health,health,diabetes,Collections: Health", "published_at": "2013-11-12", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2013-11-12"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/a7069AD", "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "Often, he noted, people point to the aging population, or doctors ordering too many tests and treatments, as the main drivers of soaring health care spending.\nAnd now his state is working on a plan that would keep hospital spending from growing faster than the economy.\nFor the study, Moses's team analyzed a range of public data sources to look at trends in health care spending since 1980.\nBut no one is saying that healthy diets and exercise are going to fix the U.S. health care problem.\nIn 2011, consumers footed the bill for 11 percent of national health care costs (in the form of insurance premiums, co-pays and other spending)."}
