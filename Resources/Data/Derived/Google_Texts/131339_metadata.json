Phoenix Children's responded by creating a first-of-its-kind pediatric clinically integrated organization.\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is already five years in the books, and its impact continues to shape the healthcare landscape. While the law's intentions were focused squarely on adult care populations, pediatric medicine has also been affected, in ways both encouraging and very concerning.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PPACA brought about several extremely positive outcomes for the pediatric population. The first was the elimination of pre-existing condition exemptions to health insurance, which substantively affected children with chronic illness, such as congenital heart defects and cystic fibrosis. Second was the ability for children to stay on their parents' health plan coverage until age 26, as opposed to the previous limit of age 19. While in some ways this elongated timeline simply moves the issue of affordable care down the road, the seven-year extension does provide more opportunities for young adults to secure coverage on their own.\n\nOne of the most striking changes that the reform act made to adult and pediatric medicine was the movement of many individuals to Medicaid. In Arizona, Medicaid eligibility is maxed out at 140% of the federal poverty line. Interestingly, Medicaid is such a comprehensive plan that for those who are eligible, it is the best insurance available, in both coverage and benefits.\n\n\n\nRobert Meyer\n\nIt is not widely known that the nationwide uninsured rate for children since the PPACA passed is now at a record low of near 7%. Between Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), the pediatric population is quite well covered. However, Arizona is the only state not to participate in CHIP, which complicates our ability at Phoenix Children's Hospital to treat the youth population.\n\nOffsetting its positive effects, the reform law introduced a new set of issues that predominantly affect the adult population but also adversely impact children and their families. Picture a scenario in which a family is on Medicaid and is using its benefits to cover treatment for their children. If that family suddenly moves up the income scale, above the 140% level, they are no longer Medicaid-eligible and are subsequently dropped into the pool of the PPACA-created exchanges.", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "Healthcare reform has changed the finances of children's hospitals across the nation.
