Anthony Watson, global chief information officer at Nike Inc., has left the company for personal reasons. A Nike spokesman confirmed the departure.

Chief Operating Officer Eric Sprunk will lead Nike’s technology organization while the company searches for a replacement, according to an internal memo reviewed by CIO Journal. “The Tech vision and strategy will be essential to developing and supporting global business needs in many areas,” Mr. Sprunk said in the memo. “Our commitment to creating this infrastructure remains steadfast, and we will continue to invest in our IT teams and business.”

The London-born Mr. Watson joined Nike in April 2014 after more than four years at Barclays PLC, where he most recently worked as CIO of Europe, Middle East & Global Operations. Prior to Barclays, he was senior vice president and global head of technology services for Wells Fargo & Co. He also has held senior roles at Citigroup Inc., Unisys Corp., Microsoft Corp. and First-e Bancorp.

At Nike, Mr. Watson worked on a vision and five-year strategy to reset technology as a critical platform for growth, the memo said. Nike struck a deal with Juniper Networks in August to co-create a new, scalable data center cloud and retail network infrastructure. CIO Journal wrote that Nike would use Juniper’s products, including software-defined networking, to serve as the foundation for virtualizing multiple Nike data centers around the world.

In October, the Financial Times named Mr. Watson the world’s fourth most influential LGBT leader. Fortune Magazine listed him as number 19 on this year’s 40 under 40 list noting, among other things, his 19 iPads and Tom Ford bespoke suits.

Update: Mr. Watson announced his departure via Twitter on Wednesday evening.
