Following its flood of faith-inspiring success are three Bible-based movies set to open in theaters this year.\n\nThe first, \u201cSon of God,\u201d is produced by the married couple who brought \u201cThe Bible\u201d to the History Channel and into households across the country \u2014 producer Mark Burnett and actress Roma Downey.\n\n\u201cWe really believed that people would show up in droves, but 100 million people was a big number,\u201d Mr. Burnett said of the 10-hour miniseries\u2019 total audience. \u201cBefore we knew those results, we\u2019d already started on \u2018Son of God.\u2019\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Hollywood films a testament to renewed interest in Bible stories\n\nThe two-hour film, which opens with a quick retelling of the Old Testament before depicting the life of Jesus, is scheduled to be released Feb. 28.\n\n\u201cWe know from the success of 'The Bible' series, it encouraged people around the water cooler or around their own kitchen tables to start talking about faith, start talking about God,\u201d Miss Downey said. \u201cWe hope when \u2018Son of God\u2018 is released that people will be talking about Jesus.\u201d\n\nHollywood appears to be banking on moviegoers\u2019 interest in faith and God as it prepares to roll out two big-budget films based on biblical tales. Producer-director-screenwriter Darren Aronofsky\u2019s 3-D opus \u201cNoah,\u201d starring Oscar winners Russell Crowe as Noah and Anthony Hopkins as his grandfather Methuselah, is due to be released in March. \u201cExodus,\u201d directed by Ridley Scott and starring Christian Bale as Moses, is scheduled to be released in December.\n\nScholars say the time is right for an influx of faith-based movies. They note that an opportunity arises every few years for filmmakers to use cutting-edge technology to capture audiences by telling some of the world\u2019s oldest and most intriguing stories.\n\n\u201cHollywood is hungry for good source material, so it reached back to one of the original treasure troves of ancient civilization that still speaks across the centuries definitely more than the average comic book,\u201d said Craig Detweiler, associate professor of communication at Pepperdine University, where he teaches a course on religion and film.\n\nS. Brent Plate, visiting associate professor of religious studies at Hamilton College, said the upcoming epics about Moses and Noah are the contemporary equivalents to 1956\u2019s \u201cTen Commandments,\u201d 1959\u2019s \u201cBen Hur\u201d and 1961\u2019s \u201cKing of Kings.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese were big-budget and secular,\u201d Mr. Plate said. \u201cSome of the filmmakers and actors professed various levels of faith, but these were not any more devotional films than the new ones.\u201d\n\nBut for Mr. Burnett, producer of CBS\u2019 \u201cSurvivor,\u201d ABC\u2019s \u201cShark Tank\u201d and NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Voice,\u201d and Miss Downey, a former star of the CBS drama \u201cTouched by an Angel,\u201d their latest endeavor is as much about faith as it is commerce \u2014 perhaps more so.\n\n\u201cSon of God\u201d was produced on a $22 million budget, a pittance compared with the reported $130 million budget for \u201cNoah.\u201d The budget for \u201cExodus\u201d has not been announced, but with a cast that includes Sigourney Weaver and Ben Kingsley, the film\u2019s budget likely will rival that of \u201cNoah.\u201d\n\n\u201cSon of God\u201d has no big-name actors, aside from Miss Downey, who portrays Jesus\u2019 mother late in the film. Jesus is portrayed by Portuguese actor Diogo Morgado, reprising the role from \u201cThe Bible\u201d miniseries.\n\nThe producers have eschewed typical marketing schemes. Churches and faith-based groups, they say, have been buying advance tickets for screenings of \u201cSon of God\u201d as group events and as a springboard for discussion, just as they did 10 years ago for director Mel Gibson\u2019s surprise blockbuster \u201cThe Passion of the Christ.\u201d\n\n\u201cSon of God\u201d has garnered praise from faith leaders such as Cardinal Donald W. Wuerl, archbishop of Washington, megachurch pastor Rick Warren and televangelist Joel Osteen.\n\n\u201cWe certainly didn\u2019t want \u201814 to go by without a huge experience for America from us,\u201d Mr. Burnett said. \u201c\u2018Son of God\u2018 is something we started on even before 'The Bible' series. It\u2019s the way it should be seen: A big feature film experience.\u201d\n\nNoting the modest budget and mostly unknown cast for \u201cSon of God,\u201d Mr. Plate of Hamilton College said, \u201cI think it will appeal to those who already profess Christianity but won\u2019t make much splash outside those circles. \u2018Noah\u2018 and \u2018Exodus\u2019 will prove much more big sellers and many nonbelievers will attend.\u201d\n\nStill, Mr. Gibson\u2019s \u201cPassion,\u201d which featured a cast of mostly unknowns and required subtitles because its script was in Aramaic, the long-dead language of the era, brought in more than $370 million with its $30 million budget.\n\nMr. Detweiler said Hollywood has \u201cconsistently underestimated\u201d the size and adventurous nature of the faith-friendly audience, and \u201cSon of God\u201d will be the latest test of that segment.\n\n\u201cWhen we live through a decade of very anxious times, I think we\u2019ve found that people\u2019s interest in ancient and transforming stories endures,\u201d he said. \u201cNew technologies allow for fresh retellings of a powerful, ancient text like the Gospel. Jesus has proven to be a remarkably portable person who\u2019s rediscovered by each generation in new ways.\u201d\n\nRegardless of how well \u201cSon of God\u201d plays on the big screen, Miss Downey said, she and her husband have an order for a 12-hour miniseries called \u201cA.D.\u201d that \u201cwill reset the story at the Crucifixion and follow the remaining disciples and beginnings of the early church.\u201d They expect the show to begin airing in autumn 2015.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the beginning, there was \"The Bible,\" the most-watched cable TV show of 2013.
