The market had been slated to expand to businesses with between 51 and 100 employees; both the House and the Senate passed the fix last week \u2014 a rare quick bipartisan ACA fix.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBYE-BYE BOEHNER: WHO'S UP NEXT? \u2014 House Republicans hold elections to replace House Speaker John Boehner this morning, and so far, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy is projecting some sunny confidence, POLITICO reports. Though that was before the House Freedom Caucus injected some drama by endorsing Rep. Daniel Webster.\n\nKY GOV NOMINEE: LET'S DRUG TEST MEDICARE RECIPIENTS \u2014 Next month's Kentucky governors race, already shaped by stark differences over the ACA, now has a Medicare twist. Republican Matt Bevins suggested in a recent debate that Medicare beneficiaries are \"on the draw\" and doubled down on his support for random drug testing for anyone who receives social benefits. Democrats are hitting him hard. DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz called the drug-testing idea a \"new low\" for Republicans.\n\nGOOD THURSDAY MORNING and welcome to PULSE, where we're not sure what the public health implications of all-day McDonald's breakfast might be \u2014 but we can guess it's going to have a pretty big impact on our own attemps to eat healthily.

Clue me in when you send tips and comments to emershon@politico.com and behley@politico.com.\n\n\"Ba da ba ba ba \u2026 I'm lovin' PULSE.\"\n\nHERE WE GO AGAIN: ANOTHER PLANNED PARENTHOOD HEARING \u2014 The House Judiciary Committee is holding its second hearing on Planned Parenthood's abortion practices this afternoon. We're not expecting the fireworks that the Oversight Committee got with its interrogation of PPFA President Cecile Richards, but a former Planned Parenthood manager could make waves. Chairman Bob Goodlatte said the hearing is meant to shed light on the \"horrific details involved in late-term abortions and what is required in order to harvest baby body parts.\" Planned Parenthood has repeatedly said the accusations that it profits from the sale of fetal tissue are false.\n\n\u2014 The House also voted Wednesday to establish a special committee, with subpoena power and broad authority to investigation abortion and fetal tissue donation practices. It will be overseen by the Energy and Commerce Committee and will have up to 13 members \u2014 to be named later. None of the investigations into Planned Parenthood thus far have revealed any wrongdoing.

Overall, it\u2019s seeming less and less likely that Medicaid expansion would end altogether after 2016, but the state may make changes to appease conservatives. Some of the highlights from the Stephen Group\u2019s final report: http://bit.ly/1RugjP7\n\n\u2014 Interestingly, the firm outlines two different buckets of recommendations to reform the so-called Medicaid \u201cprivate option,\u201d depending on who is in the White House. The \u201cin the box solution\u201d includes modest changes they believe the Obama administration would be willing to approve, including some enhanced cost-sharing for beneficiaries, a mandated work referral system, ending the existing \u201cHealth Care Independence Accounts,\u201d and cutting off enrollees who don\u2019t make required monthly payments. The second \u201cout of the box\u201d solution is outlined with a Republican administration in mind post-2016: enrollees would be subject to a 20-hour weekly work requirement, sliding scale premiums for people below the federal poverty line, and benefit limits similar to TANF. The task force has to make its recommendations to Gov. Asa Hutchinson by the end of the year.\n\nGUN CONTROL PROPOSAL AS SOON AS TODAY \u2014 Senate Democrats are expected to unveil a new gun-control proposal today \u2014 one week after the latest deadly mass-shooting.\n\nBATTLE BREWING OVER MENTAL HEALTH REFORM \u2014 And this one involves the House lawmaker pushing for reform \u2014 Rep. Tim Murphy \u2014 and groups that receive funding from SAMHSA. Murphy\u2019s reform bill essentially dismantles SAMHSA \u2014 and he's now claiming that such groups are \u201ccreating a whole cloud of lies\u201d because they fear losing their money. At a Wednesday forum, an audience member told Murphy that she had heard his bill requires states to mandate involuntary outpatient treatment for seriously mentally ill people (It does not.) Murphy suggested SAMHSA is telling the organizations to speak out against his bill. A SAMHSA spokesperson wouldn\u2019t comment on the specific allegations but told PULSE that the agency is monitoring the reform efforts in Congress.\n\nWHITE HOUSE DEFENDS CADILLAC TAX \u2014 Just days after Hillary Rodham Clinton backed scrapping the excise tax, President Obama's chief economist called it one of the ACA's \"most important tools\" for both bringing down costs and improving the quality of care. In a data-filled presentation at the Brookings Institution on Wednesday, Jason Furman called repealing or delaying the Cadillac tax \"deeply problematic.\" He argued that it lowers health care costs, increase workers' wages, and reduces the federal deficit by $90 billion over the next decade (and by half-a-trillion dollars over the next 20 years, according to White House calculations). And, these changes, he argued, will spill out across the health care system and provide employers with a \"little more incentive to exercise their market power to slow the cost of health care.\" You can read an extended version of his remarks here: http://1.usa.gov/1LiV2qE\n\n** A message from the American College of Rheumatology: More than 63 million Americans are living with doctor-diagnosed arthritis, autoimmune diseases or inflammatory rheumatic diseases, and are at risk for chronic pain, disability and even death.

Some 30 percent said at least one of their plans would be impacted in 2018 \u2014 and half of the remaining employers said they'd have a plan that would be affected by 2023. Over two-thirds of the employers that are going to reduce benefits because of the Cadillac tax said they wouldn't offer a corresponding wage increase.

Only one region generated savings in excess of those fees \u2014 saving Medicare $10.8 million and earning just $500,000 in shared savings payments. Participants did really well on quality, though \u2014 over 90 percent of practices met quality targets for patient experience and utilization measures. All the regions had lower-than-targeted readmissions rates.\n\nWE\u2019RE NUMBER ONE \u2014 at spending the most money on health care. The latest Commonwealth Fund international comparison study is out today and once again the U.S. ranked far above its peers in health care spending, despite having the lowest life expectancy. According to the report, the U.S. spent about $9,086 per person on health care in 2013 \u2014 the highest of the 13 countries included in the report \u2014 while maintaining the lowest life expectancy of 78.8 years. Switzerland, the second highest spending country \u2014 spent $6,325 per person on health care and had a life expectancy of 82.9 years.

Many of these individuals are at risk for chronic pain, organ damage, disability and even death as a result of their diagnosis.\n\nAdvocates for Arthritis are visiting Capitol Hill today [this week] to increase awareness about rheumatic diseases and elevate policy issues affecting the rheumatology community. Rheumatology professionals and patients from across the country are asking Congress to support policies to ensure access to quality care for America\u2019s rheumatology patients, including limited patient cost sharing for specialty therapies, increased funding for disease research and less restrictive insurer practices.\n\nThe American College of Rheumatology (ACR) is a professional membership organization committed to improving the care of patients with rheumatic disease and advancing the rheumatology subspecialty.\n\nVisit rheumatology.org/Advocacy to learn more. Follow the conversation at #Act4Arthritis. **\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): Many Medicare drug plans effectively require the use of \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacies that are inconvenient for patients. That means a long trip or higher copays to stick with the pharmacies that patients like. In urban areas, these plans often fail to meet the government\u2019s standard for pharmacy access. In rural areas, \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacies are often 20+ miles away! Support H.R. 793 / S. 1190. This bipartisan legislation is supported by leading consumer advocates and would let patients use any pharmacy willing to accept the \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacy terms and conditions.
