Elizabeth Warren told me yesterday, on the heels of her major address on the unfinished business of financial reform at the Levy Institute\u2019s Hyman Minsky Conference. \u201cRules promote innovation and competition. Rules prevent markets from blowing up. We learned that in 1929 and we should have learned it again in 2008.\u201d\n\nThat comment captures what distinguishes Warren from so many of her congressional and political colleagues. Any lawmaker can create a laundry list, and in her Minsky speech Warren did some of that, presenting specific steps needed to bolster financial regulation, which in its current state still puts the country at risk. But Warren has garnered attention because she actually has a worldview for how to best structure the economy, one which has become impossible for any Democrat, even the former Secretary of State winding through our nation\u2019s Chipotles, to ignore.\n\nRelated: Why Elizabeth Warren Trumps Obama\u2019s Economic Message\n\nWarren\u2019s governing philosophy can be boiled down to one simple sentiment: Actions must have consequences. The way to build functioning markets is to lay out ground rules and actually hold market participants accountable to them. That allows everyone in a market the same set of chances to succeed if they can attract enough customers. \u201cThis is about building competitive capitalism instead of crony capitalism,\u201d Warren told me.\n\nIn terms of financial regulation, that means that institutions must be punished for breaking the rules. And it means that taxpayers shouldn\u2019t be on the hook for the risks of those institutions, because they must not be rewarded for failure. \u201cEverything else flows from these two principles,\u201d Warren said, arguing for a principles-based approach to smarter, simpler regulations.\n\nYou can very easily expand that out. If a retailer sells a defective mattress that falls apart when you lay on it, the customer should be able to get their money back. If the oil industry gets special subsidies not offered to other firms in the energy space, they\u2019re gaining an unfair advantage in the market. If an auto dealer quotes you one price for a car, and then comes back and raises it, the purchaser should have recourse to claim unfair practices. (In fact, one of Warren\u2019s recommendations was to extend Consumer Financial Protection Bureau oversight to auto dealers, who are currently carved out under Dodd-Frank.)\n\nRelated: Liberals Work to Lure Elizabeth Warren into White House Race\n\nIn other words, Warren\u2019s agenda isn\u2019t the result of some narrowly focused monomania about financial institutions. It\u2019s about making the economy work, in a way that it hasn\u2019t for the past 40 years. And it\u2019s rooted in this principle that rules are necessary for healthy markets.\n\nThis is actually a pretty conservative viewpoint, in the small-c sense of the word. Lack of bailout protection should lead to conservatism, or prudence, in risk-taking. You can find plenty of conservative treatises on free market discipline, or the idea that punishment deters crime. There\u2019s obviously room within this worldview for a safety net for individuals. But this vision takes as much cruelty out of market-based capitalism as possible.\n\nEach item in Warren\u2019s laundry list fits into this coherent framework about actions and consequences. Closing the auto dealer loophole would let CFPB treat their unlawful actions the same way as other consumer products. That also goes for extending the regulatory perimeter to cover non-bank financial institutions known as \u201cshadow banks,\u201d which issue short-term debt without scrutiny from regulators. Breaking up big banks helps prevent any unfair advantages through \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d status, instead forcing companies that get into trouble to face the consequences. Limiting emergency Federal Reserve lending, the beating heart of the bailout, forces companies to reckon with failure without a lifeline. Warren even implicates the tax code for discouraging companies from being well-capitalized so they can absorb losses when they make mistakes.\n\nThe agenda only works if officials are willing to actually enforce the rules. That\u2019s where Warren directed her most critical comments on Wednesday. \u201cThe Department of Justice doesn\u2019t take big financial institutions to trial \u2014 ever \u2014 even when financial institutions engage in blatantly criminal activity.\u201d If rules are essential to markets, then allowing rules to be broken destroys them.\n\nRelated: 15 Fortune 500 Companies Paid No Federal Income Taxes in 2014\u200b\u200b\n\nWarren suggested several fixes. She would weed out deferred prosecution agreements (or their cousins, non-prosecution agreements), which give slaps on the wrist to financial miscreants. Any firm settling wrongdoing should have to pay a \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d equal to at least all of the profits obtained from the illegal activity (\u201cif that\u2019s controversial, shows there are real problems on Wall Street,\u201d Warren noted). And judges should be granted more power to review settlements. This part of the agenda could be accomplished without Congress, Warren pointed out. \u201cThere are many things regulatory agencies can and should do, starting now.\u201d\n\nI asked Warren about the so-called \u201cArthur Andersen\u201d defense, that there are collateral consequences to taking down big firms, and that settlements which don\u2019t implicate innocent bystanders are more appropriate. \u201cHow come that doesn\u2019t apply to small banks?\u201d she asked, referring to small fry prosecutions like Freedom Bank in Oklahoma. \u201cWhy is it when a small bank violates the law, no there\u2019s no hesitation to take them down, close the bank, fire the management team and put employees on the street?\u201d Again, it\u2019s this issue of clear and consistent rules for everyone that Warren wants to institute.\n\nShe also questioned the unconscious bias written into the collateral consequences argument: \u201cYou ask about the collateral consequences of enforcing the law, what about the collateral consequences of not enforcing law?\u201d Certainly, when actions have no consequences, the result is more actions that profit from law-breaking, and a market based on how expertly you can deceive.\n\nThe simplicity of this framework, along with its universal grounding in firmly held values, has made it difficult to characterize as wild-eyed liberal screeds, no matter how hard industry mouthpieces try. That gives Warren\u2019s views power, and you can see that in how Hillary Clinton wants to align herself with them, whether through laying on the praise in a Time magazine profile or hiring campaign staff with a track record on financial reform, like former Commodity Futures Trading Commission chief Gary Gensler.\n\nRelated: Why Marco Rubio Might Just Beat Hillary Clinton\n\nWhat is so far mimicry (which the financial industry has discounted, for what it\u2019s worth) needs to be accompanied by a broad articulation of an actual governing philosophy. \u201cWhat I did was lay out the structural approach,\u201d Warren said. That\u2019s what people are responding to. They don\u2019t want to know what you\u2019re for; they want to know who you are.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "\u201cRules are not the enemy of markets,\u201d Sen.", "title": "What Elizabeth Warren Has That Hillary Clinton Needs", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/04/17/What-Elizabeth-Warren-Has-Hillary-Clinton-Needs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/11112013_Clinton_Warren.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/04/17/What-Elizabeth-Warren-Has-Hillary-Clinton-Needs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/11112013_Clinton_Warren.jpg", "creator": "@ddayen", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "\u201cRules are not the enemy of markets,\u201d Sen.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3295\"", "article_summary": "Related: Why Elizabeth Warren Trumps Obama\u2019s Economic MessageWarren\u2019s governing philosophy can be boiled down to one simple sentiment: Actions must have consequences.\nRelated: Liberals Work to Lure Elizabeth Warren into White House RaceIn other words, Warren\u2019s agenda isn\u2019t the result of some narrowly focused monomania about financial institutions.\nThat also goes for extending the regulatory perimeter to cover non-bank financial institutions known as \u201cshadow banks,\u201d which issue short-term debt without scrutiny from regulators.\nThe way to build functioning markets is to lay out ground rules and actually hold market participants accountable to them.\nWarren even implicates the tax code for discouraging companies from being well-capitalized so they can absorb losses when they make mistakes."}
