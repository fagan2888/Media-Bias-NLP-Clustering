She was not sure how many had been reached.\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, CJD affects about one person in every 1 million people per year worldwide.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that there are multiple variations of CJD and this case is not related to mad cow disease,\u201d Novant Health said in a statement.\n\nThe hospital confirmed that on January 18, an operation was performed on a patient with CJD symptoms who later tested positive for the illness.\n\nEven though the surgical instruments were sterilized by standard hospital procedures, they should have gone through enhanced sterilization procedures used when there are confirmed or suspected cases of CJD.\n\nThe original patient \u201chad neurological symptoms that could have been attributed to CJD or another brain disease,\u201d Novant Health said. \u201cThere were reasons to suspect that this patient might have had CJD. As such, the extra precautions should have been taken, but were not.\u201d\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as the World Health Organization, recommends that surgical equipment used on CJD patients be destroyed or decontaminated through an intense disinfecting process.\n\nAlthough CJD can be transferred through surgical equipment, hospital officials say the likelihood of these patients contracting the disease is very low.\n\nThe CDC corroborates that assessment.\n\nIt says that no cases of the disease have been linked to the use of contaminated medical equipment since 1976.\n\nBut Lindsay made no excuses.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the entire team at Novant Health, I apologize to the patients and their families, for having caused this anxiety.\u201d\n\nCJD is a rare, degenerative and fatal brain disorder, according to the National Institutes of Health. It\u2019s characterized by rapid, progressive dementia. Initial symptoms can include problems with muscular coordination, personality changes including impaired memory and thinking; and impaired vision.\n\nCJD is believed to be caused by a type of protein called a prion. It can be sporadic, hereditary or acquired; the acquired type is the rarest form, according to the NIH, and seen in fewer than 1% of cases. It is not contagious through casual contact.\n\nAsked whether the 18 people would be tested, Mayer said there is no quick test for CJD. The original patient underwent brain surgery and then the disease was found through a number of tests afterward, she said. In some cases, CJD can take years to show up, Mayer said.\n\nThe hospital has instituted the enhanced sterilization process on all surgical instruments used in brain surgery, Novant Health said.\n\nIn September, 13 patients received similar warnings from two hospitals in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, when a patient who had undergone neurosurgery was later suspected to have CJD.\n\nThe hospitals shared the specialized surgical equipment that was used to operate on the patient and continued to use it until the suspicion of exposure to the disease surfaced.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. -- Doctors and hospital officials from Novant Health Forsyth Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, are notifying 18 neurosurgery patients that they might have been exposed to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a serious and incurable neurological disorder.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "5873d9988d745234e5abf9cff7ed939d"}, "og": {"site_name": "FOX31 Denver", "description": "WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. \u2014 Doctors and hospital officials from Novant Health Forsyth Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, are notifying 18 neurosurgery patients that they might have be\u2026", "title": "18 may have been exposed to incurable disease", "url": "http://kdvr.com/2014/02/11/18-may-have-been-exposed-to-incurable-disease/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://localtvkdvr.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/s026767074.jpg?w=1200", "height": 675}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvkdvr.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/s026767074.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@kdvr", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@kdvr"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "msapplication-tooltip": "Denver, Colorado News, Weather, Sports and more", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=334627011", "fb": {"pages": 90018331599}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://kdvr.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/17e52d5bd05a36821dc7d1d5f90e105c?s=16", "application-name": "FOX31 Denver", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/fox31denver", "published_time": "2014-02-11T17:20:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-11T17:21:27+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/fox31denver"}, "keywords": "national/world news,", "google-site-verification": "AmrqnQj74ngNWI1vn6WwMZyy9IWy4ZqooGuxLtd7lIs", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd836\"", "article_summary": "WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. \u2014 Doctors and hospital officials from Novant Health Forsyth Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, are notifying 18 neurosurgery patients that they might have been exposed to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a serious and incurable neurological disorder.\nThe original patient \u201chad neurological symptoms that could have been attributed to CJD or another brain disease,\u201d Novant Health said.\n\u201cIt is important to note that there are multiple variations of CJD and this case is not related to mad cow disease,\u201d Novant Health said in a statement.\n\u201cToday we are reaching out to 18 neurosurgery patients who were exposed to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease over the last three weeks at Forsyth Medical Center,\u201d said Jeff Lindsay, president of the center, according to WGHP.\nThe hospital has instituted the enhanced sterilization process on all surgical instruments used in brain surgery, Novant Health said."}
