Indeed, the Obama administration took pains to encourage consumers to shop around during this past open enrollment period.\n\nBut the problem, the article argues, is that degree of plan switching--as well as the many customers who drop and reenroll in coverage overall--make it more difficult and less advantageous for health insurers to help their members get and stay healthy.\n\n\"The fact that people are actually switching seems like a sign that this market is functioning as it was designed. But \u2026 all that churn sure makes it hard for an insurer to make money by investing in its customers' long-term health,\" adds New York Times reporter Margot Sanger-Katz in a discussion posted on the blog The Upshot.\n\nTherefore, a better approach may be for insurers to act like Southwest Airlines--focusing solely on offering low prices, narrow networks and exceptional customer service, according to Vox. At this point, insurers simply may lack the tools and trust necessary to work with members to change behaviors, the article adds.\n\nEven so, payers are increasingly trying to engage members through health improvement initiatives.
