NEW YORK (GenomeWeb) â€“ A health economic study sponsored by Biodesix has found that the company's Veristrat lung cancer test could potentially decrease patient treatment costs.

Published this week in the journal Lung Cancer, the study found that using Veristrat to guide patient therapy in cases of advanced non-small cell lung cancer decreased the total lifetime direct medical cost per patient by $135.
