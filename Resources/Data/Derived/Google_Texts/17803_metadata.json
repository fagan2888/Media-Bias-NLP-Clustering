After all, the former secretary of State has made a career out of charging universities hundreds of thousands of dollars in exchange for speeches.\n\nFor example, Clinton charged the University of Buffalo $275,000 to deliver a one-hour speech in October 2013 and demanded $300,000 from the University of California at Los Angeles for remarks in March 2014.\n\nShe was particularly scrutinized for demanding $225,000 from the University of Nevada-Las Vegas for her remarks at the university\u2019s foundation dinner last fall in addition to requesting the school pay for a private plane, a $1,250 transcript of her speech, and suites for she and her staff.\n\nWhile American CEOs may have earned an average of $11.7 million in 2013 according to a report last year, Hillary would have to deliver less than 40 speeches at a $300,000 price tag each to generate the same amount of money.\n\nOf course, Clinton isn\u2019t personally boosting her finances with the money she receives from speeches. She donates the funds to the Clinton Foundation, and as such still benefits from the large checks when they contribute to the growth of the charity she and her family started.\n\nAnd, Hillary\u2019s speeches aren\u2019t her only big pay days. The former first lady received an $8 million book advance for her first memoir \u201cLiving History\u201d in 2000, though the sum wasn\u2019t enough to offset the Clintons\u2019 \u201cdead broke\u201d status upon leaving the White House.\n\nHillary also received an estimated $14 million book advance for her 2014 memoir \u201cHard Choices.\u201d The Democratic presidential hopeful is estimated to have a net worth of up to $50 million.\n\nClinton is no stranger to the political spotlight, and thus she knows that running for president is almost entirely about the optics.\n\nOptically, Hillary Clinton denouncing CEO pay while having collected millions in paid speech fees and book advances doesn\u2019t look good.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "The now-official Democratic candidate sent an e-mail to supporters following her campaign announcement that lamented the fact that regular Americans currently face economic difficulties \"when the average CEO makes about 300 times what the average worker makes\"", "title": "$300k speech artist Hillary Clinton takes populist approach...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 552, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2015/04/DEM-2016-Clinton-Head_Chal-552x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2015/04/16/300k-speech-artist-hillary-clinton-takes-populist-approach-attacks-ceo-pay/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "hillary-clinton-populist", "published_time": "2015-04-16T17:42:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-16T17:42:16+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Hillary Clinton appears to be taking a populist approach to economic issues ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\nOptically, Hillary Clinton denouncing CEO pay while having collected millions in paid speech fees and book advances doesn\u2019t look good.\nUnfortunately for Clinton, she paints herself quite the hypocrite when complaining about CEO pay.\nThe now-official Democratic candidate sent an e-mail to supporters following her campaign announcement that lamented the fact that regular Americans currently face economic difficulties \u201cwhen the average CEO makes about 300 times what the average worker makes,\u201d according to Reuters.\nHillary also received an estimated $14 million book advance for her 2014 memoir \u201cHard Choices.\u201d The Democratic presidential hopeful is estimated to have a net worth of up to $50 million."}
