Ren\u00e9e Jean/Sidney Herald\n\nSIDNEY, Mont. -- She came to Sidney a struggling statistic, but now has settled into a place she can call home, and she\u2019s working on a brighter future than she ever dreamed possible. Gloria Michaels was among speakers at a ribbon cutting for Richland County Housing Authority\u2019s newest affordable housing units, and stole the show.\n\nThe young single mother came to the Bakken three years ago with a brother, looking for a fresh start. She\u2019d been on a never-ending wait list for housing in California that she described as \u201cghetto\u201d and, in the six years that followed, often had to wonder where her children would lay their heads to sleep the next day.\n\nWhen her brother was offered a position as general manager for a Holiday Inn in the area, she was just finishing up an associates degree in accounting. She decided to come with him, hoping for a fresh start and a better future than she foresaw living in California.\n\nShe found it.\n\nJust three days after arriving in the Bakken, she was directed to a job with Blue Cross Blue Shield \u2014 where she is still employed. Two months later she\u2019d signed a lease for an affordable apartment in a unit that was a far cry from ghetto.\n\nNot having to scramble daily for a place to sleep and having some place that is actually nice to live has changed all of their lives, she said in a later interview.\n\n\u201cZariah has her own room, which she got to decorate to her own tween personality,\u201d Michaels said. \u201cAnd the boys as well. They could never have that before. No matter what it was, they had to share. Now they get their own things, and I get my own, and we are so much better off.\u201d\n\nMichaels sees that her children are now comfortable in their skin and that has eased her mind. They\u2019re all free now to dream as children do, instead of worry.\n\nZariah wants to be a singer/actress someday, Paul wants to be Peter Parker, and Toryn, well, he is undecided.\n\nAnd that\u2019s OK, because he\u2019s just 5, after all.\n\n\u201cToryn, that kid, he is my little tornado right there,\u201d Michaels said. \u201cHe wants to be everything. One day he wants to be a fireman, the next a policeman. He is still undecided.\u201d\n\nMom, meanwhile, is working on a bachelor of science in accounting. Like Toryn, she\u2019s a little undecided about what to do with the degree once she finishes.\n\nOne thing she is certain of is that she\u2019s found a place to call home for a long time. \u201cMy kids will graduate here,\u201d she said. \u201cThat I can say for sure.\u201d\n\nThe thing Michaels most wants to convey is her gratitude for all the helping hands since she\u2019s come to Sidney.\n\n\u201cThe fact that this program offers a normal home, that is the biggest thing,\u201d she said. \u201cMy house is phenomenal. It is unreal nice. In California, you\u2019re used to junk, and you pay a lot for a disgusting place that is plagued with crime, and you\u2019re still in the ghetto.\u201d\n\nThe struggles that come with that type of housing \u2014 or in her case no housing at all \u2014 consume all the energy a single mom might have for higher goals in life.\n\n\u201cWe are now comfortable, we are stable,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no more energy wasted on the stress of where to stay or if we\u2019re going to share a room forever.\u201d\n\nShe has particularly appreciated the caring staff and the friendliness of people in Sidney. On a holiday where they had no heat, the maintenance staff came over to help her anyway.\n\n\u201cYou can tell they care and to me that is super amazing,\u201d Michaels said.\n\nHer story is one that makes what Richland County Housing Authority does come to life, officials at the ribbon cutting said.\n\n\u201cWe know children do better in school and graduate at higher rates when they are in stable homes,\u201d Gov. Steve Bullock said. \u201cWe know communities do better when the workforce can afford to live where the jobs are and they have safe, stable home communities. All of that is what you encompassed and more, Gloria, and this isn\u2019t an abstract. The dreams and opportunities it opened up for Gloria are dreams it opens up to every person who lives in these houses. It will give them a chance to build their lives, take care of their families. It will have a huge impact in Sidney.\u201d\n\nMeg O\u2019Leary director of Montana Department of Commerce, called it a powerful moment, seeing up close what the dollars that passed through programs her office administered has made possible.\n\n\u201cThank you, Gloria, for bringing all that paperwork and grant money to life,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is why we do what we do, and to provide jobs for all of you who helped build it. We\u2019ve been able to invest almost $20 million in grant loan programs out here in Richland County.\u201d\n\nRichland County Housing Director Stacey Netz credited former director Paul Groshart with the project, which she said was 10 years in the making. \u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous impact for individuals,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s allowed them to work and reside in Richland County and we are happy to call them our neighbors.\u201d\n\nDon Sterhan is president and CEO of Mountain Plains Equity Group, which acted as a co-developer with Richland County Housing Authority on the $6.8 million project.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s times like this, you get your head so deep into spreadsheets and talking to bankers and lawyers and finance companies, sometimes you forget this is where this is going,\u201d he said. \u201cA day like today is a fun day for us. We stand here with our partners who have made this happen, and it\u2019s fun for us to hear from Gloria, the impact this is having on their lives.\u201d\n\nThis is actually the second affordable housing units built by the Billings-based Mountain Plains. The first was a two-story unit of 20 apartments near Crestwood Senior Retirement community which opened in 2015. The company is also working with the city on Sage Court, which is 10 town homes for essential workers such as teachers, deputies, nurses and so forth.\n\n\u201cI have to give the city credit, I haven\u2019t seen as many communities take the kind of leadership role and be as proactive about solving their own problems as they have been here,\u201d Sterhan said in an interview prior to the ceremony.\n\nSterhan\u2019s company has projects across Montana and the Bakken. Among those finished recently in Williston Park Ridge Town Homes, which opened last fall.\n\nThey\u2019re also working on a subdivision near the Law and Justice center called the Homestead, which is in the architectural planning stages.\n\nHe does not believe the area is overbuilt.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always something you have to start and examine, but I\u2019m bullish on the Bakken,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just a temporary pullback. I am convinced good days are ahead. This is a breathing time and we will get going again.\u201d\n\nHe said despite the pullback, they intend to break ground this fall or next on the HomeStead.\n\n\u201cWe will do that in phases,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get too aggressive. We\u2019ll do five or six at a time, and as those get absorbed, we\u2019ll do five or six more.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,business,bakken,oil patch,housing,Home,economy,Money,Affordable housing,region", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Grand Forks Herald", "description": "SIDNEY, Mont. -- She came to Sidney a struggling statistic, but now has settled into a place she can call home, and she\u2019s working on a brighter future than she ever dreamed possible.
