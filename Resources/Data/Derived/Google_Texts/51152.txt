Mandy Moore has had long hair and short, but the star admitted she's often considered going all the way with her haircuts.

“I’ve always wanted to really cut my hair, like, super, super short. I did once,” she admitted. “I’ve always thought about shaving my head too. That’s always intrigued me.”

Moore has worn her hair short in the past, and it's often on her mind to do it again.

“I kind of feel that way a lot, but I don’t necessarily act upon it all the time," she said. "Baby steps I guess."

And as for how her husband, singer Ryan Adams would take such a drastic 'do?

“I don’t think my husband would object to it!” she said. “He would totally be down for that. I think he’d think it’d probably be pretty punk!”
