Approximately 40 percent of the district\u2019s 518,000 registered voters are Democrats and 32 percent are Republican.\n\nAlthough Pavley trailed Zink in the 2012 primary, she won by 5 percent in the general election. With Pavley out of the picture, Republicans now have a good chance to win her seat, Fazio said.\n\nThe 27th district now reaches from Malibu to the Santa Clarita Valley and comprises western San Fernando Valley and eastern Ventura County. Its numerous communities have distinct needs the next senator must identify with, said the 56-year-old Fazio, who owns a laundry and dry cleaning company.\n\nHe said his goal is to make California more businessfriendly.\n\nThe regulatory environment for small businesses has become onerous, Fazio said. In addition to excessive taxes, governmental regulations and labor laws, \u201cthere is a complete lack of tort reform so small businesses are constantly barraged by lawsuits. It should be all of our concern. We don\u2019t have a robust business climate, and many companies are leaving the state.\u201d\n\nThe proposed $15 minimum wage would lead to higher automation and unemployment, the businessman said.\n\nMandatory sick pay leave, the Affordable Care Act, rising workers\u2019 compensation costs and other tax increases have already made it difficult for small businesses to hire and promote employees, he said. Pay should be based on merit, and entry-level jobs are a good thing because they give workers an opportunity for growth.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of the antibusiness sentiment in Sacramento,\u201d said Agoura Hills City Councilmember Denis Weber, a Fazio supporter. \u201cThere is a need for balance and hopefully Steve can bring that to the state.\u201d\n\nA former reserve officer with the Los Angeles Police Department and member of the city\u2019s Fire Commission, Fazio, like most Republicans, stands tough on crime.\n\n\u201c Whereas California has made progress, there have been some setbacks,\u201d he said. Reduction of sentencing guidelines and realignment\u2014shifting prisoners back to county jails\u2014has resulted in more inmate releases and a double-digit increase in violent crime.\n\n\u201cPolice arrest people in the front door and they\u2019re allowed out through the back door. This is a problem; we\u2019re seeing this in our streets now. . . . We have to do something other than to release people who are predisposed into a life of crime back into our neighborhoods,\u201d the candidate said.\n\nRegarding education, Fazio accused the public school system of failing its students.\n\nAnd he promised to be an advocate of the state parklands so they can remain accessible to the public.\n\n\u201cAs the state senator for this area I hope to be able to provide a good balance for the people that live here. That means good jobs, safe neighborhoods, quality schools and a variety of other policy areas that the state government is involved in that provides the quality of life we have grown to expect,\u201d he said.\n\nAs of early April Fazio had raised $400,000 for his campaign, about $150,000 short of his goal.\n\nThe California primary election is June 7.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Simi Valley Acorn", "description": "The third in a series of stories profiling candidates in the June primary election.", "title": "GOP candidate talks economy", "headline": "GOP candidate talks economy", "image": "http://www.simivalleyacorn.com/sites/www.simivalleyacorn.com/files/images/2016-05-06/17p1.jpg", "url": "http://www.simivalleyacorn.com/news/2016-05-06/Community/GOP_candidate_talks_economy.html", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ourhometowninc", "image": "http://www.simivalleyacorn.com/sites/www.simivalleyacorn.com/files/images/2016-05-06/17p1.jpg", "description": "The third in a series of stories profiling candidates in the June primary election.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "GOP candidate talks economy"}}, "article_summary": "GOP candidate talks economyBy Sylvie Belmond belmond@theacorn.comThe third in a series of stories profiling candidates in the June primary election.\nThe California primary election is June 7.\nFazio is one of six contenders\u2014 five Democrats and himself\u2014 vying to replace Pavley, whose term expires in November.\nWith Pavley out of the picture, Republicans now have a good chance to win her seat, Fazio said.\nThe 27th district now reaches from Malibu to the Santa Clarita Valley and comprises western San Fernando Valley and eastern Ventura County."}
