Parade highlights Palatine's Paint the Town Green festival

hello

Palatine held its 6th annual Paint the Town Green festival in the village's downtown Saturday, featuring an Irish Market, entertainment, and food and beverages from local restaurants.

But the highlight of the one-day event is the parade, which this year included about 50 entries, among them the Midlothian Scottish Bag Pipe Band, the Trinity Irish Dancers and numerous Irish-themed floats.

Grand marshals Lucky McClover and Katie M'Lady led the march, along with honorary Grand Marshal Marilyn Pedersen, who has been involved with the Palatine Historical Society for more than 40 years and who is an integral part of Palatine 150, this year's celebration of the village's 150th birthday.
