Old habits die hard.

For a 41-year-old Bridgeton man, that spelled trouble.

Christopher Miller was sentenced to 16 years in prison Friday for returning to the Stride Rite shoe store in Toms River last year to rob it the day after he was paroled from a prison sentence for committing a holdup at the same store 15 years earlier, authorities said.

In fact, in both holdups, Miller robbed the same store clerk, authorities said.

And that helped lead to his demise the second time around because the clerk, now familiar with Miller, was able to identify him for police when they responded to the most recent robbery on March 22, 2014, authorities said. Miller was arrested later the same day.

That occurred a day after Miller was released from New Jersey State Prison in Trenton, where he was paroled from a 15-year prison term imposed for robbing the same clerk at the Toms River Stride Rite store on Hooper Avenue, as well as committing two other armed robberies over three straight days, authorities said.

Superior Court Judge James M. Blaney imposed the latest prison term on Miller on Friday and ordered that he serve 85 percent of the term before he can be considered for release on parole, authorities said. Laura Pierro, chief trial attorney for the Ocean County Prosecutorâ€™s Office, argued for the maximum term of 20 years.
