After President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address, Fox News Channel’s Bret Baier noted Obama failing to mention al Qaeda was the first time since 2001 al Qaeda has not been used in a State of the Union speech.

Baier said, “His speech focused, as predicted, far less on foreign policy than domestic matters. He said no challenge poses a greater threat to the future generations than climate change. On national security threats, 13 days after the “Charlie Hebdo” attacks in France, tied directly to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, 12 days after the head of British intelligence warned of massive attacks from core al Qaeda in Syria, and 13 1/2 years after the 9/11 attacks here, the words al Qaeda were never used. The first time those words have not been used in the State of the Union address since February 2001.”
