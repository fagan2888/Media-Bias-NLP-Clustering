And that\u2019s a good thing. It\u2019s long past time to air out our deep-seated gender issues and redefine what it means to be a woman.\n\nFor decades, women have tried to fit into a world standardized around men. In her 2008 presidential campaign, Clinton said she wasn\u2019t running as a woman, but as a great candidate. For 2016, she\u2019s wholeheartedly embraced the fact that she can be both.\n\nFueled by social media and a progressive cultural environment, feminism has never been more popular \u2014 or more populist. And that\u2019s a good thing, too.\n\nThe economy is stronger when more women are involved, not just a token few. This is not because women are inherently better than men, but because diversity of thought and experience is better than a narrow view.\n\nColorado is a top state for women\u2019s workforce participation, which overall added $2 trillion to the U.S. economy since the 1970s. Yet women hold only 7 percent of top corporate positions in Colorado.\n\nIn the 2016 presidential race, women are a majority of registered voters in Colorado, and a widening gender gap could tip the scales. Single white women \u2014 along with Hispanics, young voters, and working-class white men \u2014 are likely swing votes in the election.\n\nClinton launched her campaign in June with a reference to her historic candidacy, calling her outdoor rally on New York\u2019s Roosevelt Island \u201ca place with absolutely no ceilings.\u201d\n\nTo break those glass ceilings, women in Clinton\u2019s generation often had to work twice as hard as their male colleagues to earn half as much money \u2014 all while dealing with rampant sexism.\n\nWhile these glass breakers are celebrated for their firsts, however, they\u2019re also criticized by younger feminists for being the only members of a small and exclusive group.\n\nIn 2016, feminism\u2019s greatest challenge is that women must not only be equal to men, but to each other as well.\n\nFrom the start, the banner of feminism has been held primarily by white women privileged with the education and opportunity to reach the glass ceiling \u2014 and make those initial cracks. But women\u2019s suffrage also has strong ties to social justice.\n\nIn Colorado, suffragists argued that female voters would address the needs of working people who were ignored by mainstream politicians, according to the Women of the West Museum.\n\nToday, young women are quick to point out that so-called corporate feminists rarely represent the intersection of race, class, gender, and sexual orientation that creates a multilayered experience for many women.\n\nThe issue of equal pay, which Clinton referenced in her kick-off speech, is a good example of that intersection. While women in Colorado make 77.9 cents for every dollar earned by men, African- American women make 67.5 cents on that same dollar, and Hispanic women make just 52.5 cents.\n\nIf Clinton captures women\u2019s votes in 2016, it won\u2019t be simply because of her gender, but also because she convinces women of all backgrounds and experiences that she\u2019s willing and able to flip America\u2019s patriarchy on its head.\n\nSo far, she seems to understand the challenge. Clinton\u2019s \u201cFighter\u201d campaign video highlights her 1995 visit to Beijing, where she told the U.N. Conference on Women: \u201cHuman rights are women\u2019s rights and women\u2019s rights are human rights, once and for all.\u201d\n\nIt was one of Clinton\u2019s most iconic feminist moments \u2014 and a part of her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that clearly illustrates her willingness to fight for all women and girls.\n\nClinton established herself as a fighter again in her kickoff speech, in which she outlined her plan to restore equity to the middle class.\n\nAnd she\u2019s planted her feet firmly at the intersection of gender, class, race and sexual orientation in solidarity with women who see feminism as just one facet of a more complex identity.\n\nClinton is impassioned on racial issues. After the shooting of nine people in a black church in Charleston, S.C., she told the U.S. Conference of Mayors: \u201cDespite our best efforts and our highest hopes, America\u2019s long struggle with race is far from finished.\u201d\n\nShe strongly supported the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to legalize gay marriage in all 50 states. \u201cLove triumphed in the highest court in our land,\u201d Clinton told supporters. \u201cEquality triumphed.\u201d\n\nAnd she includes men in feminism\u2019s promise of equal opportunity by framing universal preschool and child care, paid sick days and family leave, and affordable college as family issues that impact both genders. It\u2019s a timely message: In Colorado, more than 6o percent of children under the age of 6 live in households where all parents work.\n\nOf course, female leadership is no guarantee for passing family-friendly legislation. Colorado has the highest percent of female legislators of any state, and an all-female leadership team in the house.\n\nBut with Republicans controlling the state Senate, Democrats were unable to pass bills to create a family and medical leave insurance program, raise the minimum wage, or make it easier for middle-class families to save for college.\n\nClinton would face a similarly tough battle. But it\u2019s these populist elements of her campaign that may give her the chance to fight it.\n\nClinton\u2019s everyday feminism is also a contrast to the more individualized brand of feminism promoted by GOP candidate and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, who recently visited Colorado.\n\nIn a campaign speech, Fiorina said a feminist is \u201ca woman who lives the life she chooses.\u201d Unfortunately, that definition only includes women who have the opportunity to make choices.\n\nEventually, the GOP\u2019s male candidates will need to join this conversation. And that\u2019s a good thing, too. Because while over 80 percent of Americans say they believe in full gender equality, only one-fifth identify themselves as feminists \u2014 or people who believe all men and women should have equal opportunities.\n\nBack in 2007, Clinton\u2019s gender-neutral campaign created strong debate among feminists. \u201cDo liberated women want to join the clubhouse or do we want to burn it down?\u201d asked a columnist for The Nation.\n\nThe answer is neither. Feminism\u2019s goal is not to enable women to succeed in a man\u2019s world, nor to attack the success of men. Rather, it requires an entirely new paradigm, where success is no longer defined by male experiences, and all human beings have equal opportunities to succeed.\n\nBy putting her gender at center stage in 2016, Clinton may finally clarify the conversation \u2014 and help voters realize our shared belief in gender equality makes us all feminists at heart.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Wirthman: Hillary Clinton\u2019s everyday feminism", "title": "Wirthman: Hillary Clinton\u2019s everyday feminism", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/02/wirthman-hillary-clintons-everyday-feminism/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150702__20150705_Z00_OP05C_WIRTHMAN_HILLARYp1.jpg", "height": 411}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150702__20150705_Z00_OP05C_WIRTHMAN_HILLARYp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-02T11:46:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T15:35:03+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda62c\"", "article_summary": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign is a manifesto for everyday feminism, both in Colorado and the nation.\nClinton\u2019s everyday feminism is also a contrast to the more individualized brand of feminism promoted by GOP candidate and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, who recently visited Colorado.\nFueled by social media and a progressive cultural environment, feminism has never been more popular \u2014 or more populist.\nIn 2016, feminism\u2019s greatest challenge is that women must not only be equal to men, but to each other as well.\nBack in 2007, Clinton\u2019s gender-neutral campaign created strong debate among feminists."}
