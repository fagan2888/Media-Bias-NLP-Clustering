Don\u2019t move your wrist, doctors told him. Don\u2019t grab anything with your right hand, no matter how light. It\u2019s turned the right-handed Washington Nationals reliever into a temporary lefty, forcing him to text, drive, eat, type and use the remote control all with his off-hand.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m almost getting good at it,\u201d Stammen said with a smile. \u201cThere\u2019s not a pile of food on the floor when I\u2019m done eating anymore.\u201d\n\nThe brace has altered Stammen\u2019s day-to-day life, and the surgically-repaired flexor tendon that it protects has changed his role in Washington this season. Stammen is no longer the Nationals\u2019 unflappable swingman, jogging in from the bullpen to throw any number of pitches at any point in any game, often with overshadowed success. For the rest of this season, he is more coach than player, a support system for a young bullpen filled with players still trying to adjust to relieving at the big-league level.\n\nSEE ALSO: Bryce Harper, Matt Williams ejected against Yankees\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just kind of like an advisor right now,\u201d closer Drew Storen said. \u201cA bullpen advisor, I guess, is kind of what we call him.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an apt role for one of the game\u2019s most consistent pitchers. From 2012 to 2014, no major-league reliever threw more innings than Stammen. He posted a 2.93 ERA over 242 2/3 innings in that three-year span, never landing on the disabled list and evolving from a long-relief lynchpin to a late-innings option in big situations. The 31-year-old allowed only two hits in five appearances this season, at least two of which came after the tendon in his arm had torn.\n\nSeason-ending surgery gave Stammen an opportunity to step away from the team for a while, or maybe even take a summer vacation. Instead, he is at Nationals Park before and during every home game, watching the action from the dugout or on one of the flat-screen TVs in the clubhouse.\n\nSEE ALSO: Walk-off homer the latest milestone in Ryan Zimmerman\u2019s clutch career\n\n\u201cThis is all I really know. I can\u2019t think of anything I\u2019d rather be doing,\u201d Stammen said. \u201cI\u2019ve invested with them for the past six years and tried to win a championship with them, and this is my way of sticking around, and hopefully winning a championship with these guys.\u201d\n\nStammen enjoys the clubhouse atmosphere and spending time with teammates, but his presence also has a tangible effect. Five members of Washington\u2019s bullpen were in the minor leagues within the past two years, and many of them are still adjusting to their roles at the big league level. Stammen serves as a sounding board for those players, a source of both advice and reassurance.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately he had a setback, but that doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s not a teammate,\u201d manager Matt Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for him, it\u2019s important for us, to have him here and be present in our clubhouse. It\u2019s no fun when you can\u2019t play, but he\u2019s a pro and he understands that it\u2019s important for him to be here and talk with the guys, mingle, be on the bench, do the things that he\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\nEven when the Nationals are on the road, Stammen is sitting on his couch at home, following every pitch. Watching the games on television has forced him to view them from a different angle, and he\u2019s picked up on things he might not have noticed from the bullpen. More than once, Stammen said he has sent a text to pitching coach Steve McCatty or another member of the coaching staff, pointing out a potential pattern or something the Nationals can exploit.\n\nIt\u2019s a strange feeling, he said, watching road games after being present for six years of them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of yelling at Bob [Carpenter] and F.P. [Santangelo] on TV,\u201d Stammen said, laughing. \u201cNo, mostly just watching pitch sequences and trying to pitch along with the pitchers, and hit along with the hitters. If I see something that pops out, send a quick text or whatever and say, \u2018Hey, check this out, see what you think.\u2019 Little stuff like that, but nothing major.\u201d\n\nFor all the injuries and uncertainty in Washington\u2019s bullpen early this season, it will enter Friday\u2019s series-opener against the Philadelphia Phillies with a 3.16 ERA, which ranks 10th in the majors. The starting rotation has a collective ERA of 4.05, which ranks 16th.\n\nStammen believes the team\u2019s young group of relievers will only improve as the season winds on and roles are solidified. And every day, he moves one step closer to rejoining them in 2016. The brace comes off in roughly 10 days, with a lengthy rehabilitation process to follow.\n\nAs Stammen retrains his arm with hopes of being ready for the start of next season, he will continue to encourage or advise his younger teammates, regardless of whether those sentiments come from the clubhouse or his couch. Even when injured, he\u2019s always happy to fill an important role on the team, whatever that role may be.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Stammen will not pitch again this season, but he has attended every home game since undergoing surgery last month, serving as an important source of advice and encouragement for a young Nationals' bullpen.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Stammen will not pitch again this season, but he has attended every home game since undergoing surgery last month, serving as an important source of advice and encouragement for a young Nationals\u2019 bullpen.", "title": "Injured Craig Stammen embraces role as Nationals\u2019 bullpen advisor", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/21/injured-craig-stammen-embraces-role-nationals-bull/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/21/AP125511417566.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/21/AP125511417566.jpg", "description": "Stammen will not pitch again this season, but he has attended every home game since undergoing surgery last month, serving as an important source of advice and encouragement for a young Nationals' bul", "card": "summary", "title": "Injured Craig Stammen embraces role as Nationals\u2019 bullpen adviso"}, "Author": "Tom Schad", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Craig Stammen, Washington Nationals"}, "article_summary": "Even when injured, he\u2019s always happy to fill an important role on the team, whatever that role may be.\n\u201cA bullpen advisor, I guess, is kind of what we call him.\u201dIt\u2019s an apt role for one of the game\u2019s most consistent pitchers.\nStammen is no longer the Nationals\u2019 unflappable swingman, jogging in from the bullpen to throw any number of pitches at any point in any game, often with overshadowed success.\nStammen believes the team\u2019s young group of relievers will only improve as the season winds on and roles are solidified.\nSEE ALSO: Bryce Harper, Matt Williams ejected against Yankees\u201cHe\u2019s just kind of like an advisor right now,\u201d closer Drew Storen said."}
