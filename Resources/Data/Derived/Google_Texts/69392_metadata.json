Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF). Through the enactment of this legislation, premiums paid by those beneficiaries enrolled in the Medicaid expansion plan will match 2 percent of their income.\n\nThe legislation additionally mandates Medicaid program reforms and fosters job training, readiness opportunities, and tort reform regarding contract for injury or death in association with alleged professional negligence.\n\nThe new law and program initiatives may garner federal approval with enactment beginning by early next year, confirms An Association of Montana Health Care Providers (MHA).\n\nStates MHA President, Dick Brown, \u201cSB405 passed due to the unwavering commitment of several advocacy groups working together with Democratic and moderate Republican legislators to find a Montana solution to cover 70,000 of our neighbors.\u201d Brown adds he is proud of the role MHA played in helping SB405 pass.\n\nMind the ACA gap\n\nAccording to KFF, as of April 2015, a total of 29 states have established Medicaid income eligibility levels for adults, including parents, at or below this income level to directly reflect the states\u2019 active adoption of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansion. Upon the ACA\u2019s implementation, Medicaid eligibility was expanded to low-income adults. Two expansion states extended Medicaid eligibility for adults/parents above the ACA minimum levels, confirms KFF \u2013 DC at 221 percent FPL for those classified as \u201cother adults\u201d and CT at 201 percent for parents.\n\nThe role of Medicaid for economically disadvantaged adults has increased within these 29 states that have formerly adopted Medicaid expansion, KFF additionally confirms.\n\nStates KFF, \u201cAlthough full federal financing for the expansion begins to phase down in 2016 to 90%, there is no deadline by which states must adopt the Medicaid expansion to low-income adults and debate continues in several states.\u201d KFF adds gaps in coverage will occur for those states that have not yet adopted the Medicaid expansion.\n\nConcerns and praise for HELP Act\n\nHealthcare industry leaders and experts cite both firm benefits and disadvantages of the aforementioned initiatives.\n\nExpansion will boost the economy and create 12,000 additional jobs, according to the Bureau of Business and Economic Research (BBER) with The University of Montana.\n\nThe financial benefits of the HELP Act\u2019s acceptance of federal funds are widespread, according to BBER. \u201cNew federal dollars will flow into Montana as the federal government supports each state\u2019s Medicaid expansion,\u201d maintains BBER. \u201cThese dollars otherwise wouldn\u2019t exist, and as such, new dollars create jobs, labor income, and potential new tax revenues for state governments,\u201d BBER adds.\n\nHowever, low-income Montana families may be unable to easily afford their healthcare premiums. Says The Montana Budget and Policy Center (MPBC), \u201cWhile the premiums will be limited to 2% of enrollees\u2019 modified adjusted gross income, this could be a real stretch for Montana\u2019s low-income families.\u201d\n\nA failure of premium payment is perhaps likely for those Montana residents who earn below 100 percent of the poverty line, confirms MPBC. \u201cThere is no disenrollment for nonpayment, however the unpaid premiums become a collectable debt by the state,\u201d adds MBPC. \u201cFor Montanans who are above 100% of the poverty line, failure to pay within 90 days of notice will result in disenrollment.\u201d\n\nAdds MBPC in reference to those 70,000 Montanans affected by the bill's passing, \u201cThis is too important.\u201d\n\nAlthough the widespread influence of the Montana HELP Act is perhaps yet to be firmly determined, it is hopeful any of the aforementioned wrinkles will be ironed out so the healthcare industry can prosper and thrive accordingly and low-income beneficiaries will receive improved access to high quality, value-based care.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Medicaid coverage is multiplying for low-income beneficiaries via the Montana HELP Act, SB405, signed by MT Governor, Steve Bullock.", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/medicaid-expansion-bill-help-act-signed-by-mt-governor", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/Orange_Pills.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Medicaid Expansion Bill, HELP Act, Signed by MT Governor"}, "twitter": {"description": "Medicaid coverage is multiplying for low-income beneficiaries via the Montana HELP Act, SB405, signed by MT Governor, Steve Bullock.", "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/Orange_Pills.jpg"}, "title": "Medicaid Expansion Bill, HELP Act, Signed by MT Governor", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The role of Medicaid for economically disadvantaged adults has increased within these 29 states that have formerly adopted Medicaid expansion, KFF additionally confirms.\n\u201cNew federal dollars will flow into Montana as the federal government supports each state\u2019s Medicaid expansion,\u201d maintains BBER.\nThrough the enactment of this legislation, premiums paid by those beneficiaries enrolled in the Medicaid expansion plan will match 2 percent of their income.\nMedicaid coverage is multiplying for low-income beneficiaries via the Montana HELP Act.\nUpon the ACA\u2019s implementation, Medicaid eligibility was expanded to low-income adults."}
