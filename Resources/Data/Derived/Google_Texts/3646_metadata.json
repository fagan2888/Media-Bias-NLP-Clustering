John McCain (R-AZ) escalated. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous that a deal like this is going forward and can be allowed to go forward. With proper negotiators we could have had a great deal.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nTrump said the negotiators for Obama didn\u2019t read his book, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d which walks readers through how to effectively negotiate.\n\n\u201cWe have people that did not read \u2018The Art of the Deal\u2019 negotiating,\u201d Trump said.\n\nWe have people that have no concern about the views of our country. It\u2019s incredible. Only very stupid people are in favor of it. It\u2019s incredible the way this thing was just rammed through and how they gave up so many points at the end. Did you see the last day? They just gave up so many points at the end. It\u2019s a very, very incredible situation and frankly our representatives should be ashamed of themselves. It looks like they\u2019re not going to be able to stop it because the veto is not going to get overridden based on everything I see and hear. That\u2019s a real bad mark on our politicians including the Republicans that can\u2019t get the votes.\n\nWhen asked if\u2014with Obamatrade, which Trump made sure to point out \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014which, by the way, I didn\u2019t support, as you know,\u201d and other matters\u2014Republicans and Democrats in Congress have cheapened what it means to have a treaty, Trump said \u201cthat\u2019s absolutely right.\u201d\n\nTechnically, a treaty would require 67 votes to pass the Senate. But since Congress has rolled over on this and so many other matters, they\u2019ve agreed that this is not a treaty\u2014which means instead of requiring 67 votes to pass the Senate, it would require 67 votes to stop it via overriding a presidential veto.\n\n\u201cTwo other things: All the money we\u2019re giving them [Iran], we\u2019re going to make them a really rich power,\u201d Trump added.\n\nThe other thing is from a psychological standpoint we have four prisoners over there. It\u2019s inconceivable that any deal would be made with those four prisoners left. Inconceivable. And then when Obama gave the answer, he didn\u2019t want to complicate it. It was too complicated. It\u2019s nothing complicated. It\u2019s one sentence: We want our prisoners back. And it\u2019s good for everyone if you give them back. Good for everyone: Good for them, for us. They don\u2019t want them. We do.\n\nTrump concluded by noting that Obama wouldn\u2019t be able to get away with this if Congress\u2014especially Republicans in Congress\u2014weren\u2019t so \u201cweak.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that Congress is so weak,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that these people on both sides are so pathetically weak\u2014pathetically weak. It\u2019s a great embarrassment to our nation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trump said the negotiators for Obama didn\u2019t read his book, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d which walks readers through how to effectively negotiate.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Trump said the negotiators for Obama didn\u2019t read his book, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d which walks readers through how to effectively negotiate.", "title": "Exclusive \u2014 Donald Trump: Iran Deal An \u2018Outrage,\u2019 GOP Congress That\u2019s \u2018Weak\u2019 As Much To Blame As Obama - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/trump-pointing-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/22/exclusive-donald-trump-iran-deal-an-outrage-gop-congress-thats-weak-as-much-to-blame-as-obama/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Trump said the negotiators for Obama didn\u2019t read his book, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d which walks readers through how to effectively negotiate.", "title": "Exclusive \u2014 Donald Trump: Iran Deal An \u2018Outrage,\u2019 GOP Congress That\u2019s \u2018Weak\u2019 As Much To Blame As Obama - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/trump-pointing-AP.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump, iran deal, President Obama, The Art of the Deal,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,Trump", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "The Art of the Deal", "published_time": "2015-07-22T10:11:43-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Trump concluded by noting that Obama wouldn\u2019t be able to get away with this if Congress\u2014especially Republicans in Congress\u2014weren\u2019t so \u201cweak.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that Congress is so weak,\u201d Trump said.\n\u201cWe have people that did not read \u2018The Art of the Deal\u2019 negotiating,\u201d Trump said.\n\u201cTwo other things: All the money we\u2019re giving them [Iran], we\u2019re going to make them a really rich power,\u201d Trump added.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBillionaire real estate magnate and 2016 GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump tells Breitbart News exclusively that not only is President Barack Obama to blame for the \u201coutrage\u201d that is the nuclear arms deal with Iran, but a \u201cweak\u201d GOP-controlled Congress is too.\n\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous that a deal like this is going forward and can be allowed to go forward."}
