Now supporters hope to convince Virginia lawmakers to take the option under Obamacare to expand the number of working poor who qualify for Medicaid.\n\n\n\nKaren Cameron, director with Virginia Consumer Voices for Health Care, would like the General Assembly to hear from folks in the coverage gap - people with too much income for current Medicaid, but too poor to get a tax credit in the health insurance exchanges.\n\n\n\n\"People should contact their members of the General Assembly and let them know why closing the coverage gap is important,\" says Cameron. \"We can make others, including our decision makers aware of the diversity of people in the coverage gap and the circumstances that have put them there.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to federal and state figures, 15 million people have gained healthcare coverage nationally - 285,000 in Virginia. Another 195,000 in the gap would be covered if the state expanded Medicaid.\n\n\n\nRepublicans in Congress and at the state level have worked to repeal or dismantle healthcare reform, arguing it would cost too much or raise the cost of care too high. But according to the Congressional Budget Office the law will soon reduce the deficit by $45 billion a year.\n\n\n\nMichael Cassidy, president with The Commonwealth Institute, says reform is working - both increasing the number of people covered, and holding down the overall cost of care.\n\n\n\n\"It's time for Virginia lawmakers to recognize that health reform is working, abandon their efforts to undermine it and take advantage of the opportunities that health reform offers right here in Virginia,\" says Cassidy.\n\n\n\nAccording to Cameron, the Virginia economy is losing about $2 billion by not expanding Medicaid, and both the state budget and the state hospital system would benefit from fewer people who couldn't pay for their care.\n\nDan Heyman, Public News Service - VA", "article_metadata": {"description": "RICHMOND, Va. - With the major legal challenge done, Virginia healthcare reform groups now aim to put public pressure on lawmakers to expand Medicaid.
