The winner is expected to offer the luxury car-maker publicly financed incentives exceeding a half-billion dollars.\n\nTesla signaled this would be no ordinary competition last fall, when it gathered economic development officials from seven Western states and unveiled its vision for a \u201cgigafactory.\u201d (\u201cGiga\u201d refers to the large amount of power that batteries produced at the plant will store.)\n\nThis spring, CEO Elon Musk announced Tesla would take the extremely unusual step of spending millions to prepare sites in two states \u2014 or perhaps even three \u2014 before the finalist was chosen. Then, over the summer, Musk said the winning state would pitch in about 10 percent of the cost, effectively signaling a minimum bid of $500 million.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t usually see companies setting a floor at which states will be considered,\u201d said Leigh McIlvaine of the research group Good Jobs First, which tracks large subsidy packages by states.\n\nFor all the public anticipation Musk has created, much about the process remains secret.\n\nWhile an industrial park in the desert outside Reno, Nevada, is one known site, the other \u2014 or others \u2014 remains a mystery. Tesla has asked states not to discuss their offers, and states aren\u2019t talking.\n\nThe effect is a game of high-stakes poker, with the states as players and Tesla dealing.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t see any cards at all. Do you stay in or not, push more chips onto the table or fold?\u201d said Kim Hill, who studies incentives at the nonprofit Center for Automotive Research in Michigan.\n\nThe factory promises something that every state wants but rarely gets these days: thousands of good-paying factory jobs and all the residual economic benefits they bring.\n\nSo far, Nevada, California, Texas, Arizona and New Mexico remain contenders. They have passed tax breaks, promised worker-training funds or proposed shelving environmental regulations that could slow the factory\u2019s construction. There is talk of special legislative sessions to sweeten the bids.\n\nWhen The Associated Press filed public records act requests for documents about the competition with each of the five finalist states, none released much useful information and most refused to release anything at all, citing the competitive need to keep their offers secret.\n\nIn one glimpse behind the curtain of confidentiality, California provided an email from a Tesla official to the governor\u2019s senior adviser for jobs and economic development. It contained a newspaper story speculating on a possible site and said, simply: \u201cThis is unhelpful.\u201d What might be unhelpful was unclear, and the governor\u2019s office of business and economic development refused repeated requests to discuss its pursuit of the factory.\n\nTesla needs the factory to make cheaper batteries for its Model 3, a mass-market electric car the company hopes to sell by 2017 for around $35,000. Currently Tesla only offers the Model S sedan, which starts at $70,000.\n\nThe tight production timeframe compels Tesla to prepare at least two sites, said spokesman Simon Sproule, who likened the approach to \u201can insurance policy.\u201d\n\nTesla will pay about half of the factory\u2019s cost; the other major investor is Panasonic, which will manufacture the lithium-ion battery cells and invest in equipment.\n\nMusk has said to expect groundbreaking on at least one other site in coming months and a final decision by year\u2019s end.\n\nThe last comparable bidding frenzy for a factory, according to John Boyd of the New Jersey-based site selection firm The Boyd Company, involved competition to attract automaker Saturn in the 1980s, at the leading edge of the South\u2019s car manufacturing boom.\n\nThe competition for the gigafactory began at an October meeting at Tesla\u2019s auto assembly plant in the San Francisco Bay Area city of Fremont \u2014 a rare approach to opening a site selection process. Tesla executives laid out what a winning bid must have: \u201cGreen\u201d energy such as solar or wind at a low cost, an affordable and well-trained labor force, good transportation links to Tesla\u2019s Fremont assembly plant. And a robust package of incentives.\n\nTesla required states to submit their proposals within three weeks, an early indication of influence the company would wield. \u201cGiven the scale, it was a very short turnaround time,\u201d said Susan St. Germain, the lead business recruiter for Washington, who attended the meeting but whose state did not make the short list.\n\nAlong the way, there has been plenty of political theater. Texas Gov. Rick Perry drove to California\u2019s state Capitol in a Tesla and California state Sen. Ted Gaines delivered a gold-painted shovel to Tesla headquarters. Cities in both states pitched Tesla directly. Tucson, Arizona, sent the company a preapproved building permit.\n\nThe director of the industrial park outside Reno where Tesla prepared land said he\u2019s seen plenty of secrecy before, but never anything like this.\n\n\u201cIt has been a very, very unusual transaction,\u201d said Lance Gilman of the Reno Tahoe Industrial Center, which at 167 square miles is the nation\u2019s largest industrial park. \u201cThey have played their cards so close to the vest.\u201d\n\nTexas has done business with Musk before. The state is providing his commercial space company, SpaceX, $15.3 million in incentives to develop a rocket-launching site. The money comes from what is regarded as the nation\u2019s most generous \u201cdeal-closing fund\u201d of incentives, which has doled out $487 million since 2003.\n\nNew Mexico\u2019s governor has said that, if needed, she will ask the Legislature to consider changes in law to help land the plant. California Gov. Jerry Brown got lawmakers to pass language helping battery manufacturers, and Musk said Brown is working to address his concerns that California\u2019s arduous environmental reviews would make the project\u2019s three-year timeframe impossible to meet.\n\nNevada may hold a special session of its part-time legislature to discuss incentives.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s kind of a bidding war out there with the state of California and the state of Texas,\u201d said U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see. I\u2019m not going to start counting the jobs until it happens.\u201d\n\n___Contributing to this report were Associated Press writers Scott Sonner in Reno, Nevada; Barry Massey in Santa Fe, New Mexico; Juliet Williams in Sacramento, California; Emily Schmall in Dallas; and Bob Christie in Phoenix.___Contact Justin Pritchard at https://twitter.com/lalanewsman", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "www.yourmagnolianews.com", "description": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 From the start, little has been typical about Tesla Motors\u2019 plan for a $5 billion factory to make batteries for a new generation of electric cars.", "title": "Texas among those playing factory poker with dealer Tesla Motors", "url": "http://www.yourhoustonnews.com/magnolia/news/texas-among-those-playing-factory-poker-with-dealer-tesla-motors/article_30fb8610-31ee-11e4-815d-001a4bcf887a.html", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/yourhoustonnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/ef/fefdffdb-f471-5cce-9f9e-e047652e9f1b/5403fd701d5b5.preview-600.jpg?resize=600%2C396", "height": 396}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ScoopHouston", "card": "summary"}, "description": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 From the start, little has been typical about Tesla Motors\u2019 plan for a $5 billion factory to make batteries for a new generation of electric cars.", "msvalidate.01": "29516177700BA7C06DA5A4D58A12C04C", "fb": {"app_id": 191454774240451}, "keywords": "tesla motors,news,creekbank,news,news,news", "google-site-verification": "lqzy3EyAvgVvWDlrVhCm69f7Q1GER22OmU5rYfmsBh8", "news_keywords": "tesla motors,news,creekbank,news,news,news"}, "article_summary": "Rick Perry drove to California\u2019s state Capitol in a Tesla and California state Sen.
