A man banned from a hospital for becoming disruptive while waiting for care Sunday died after being arrested moments later, Greensboro police said.

Steve Christian, 60, died following an incident that began around 1:15 a.m. at Wesley Long Hospital. An autopsy will take place in Raleigh.

Christian was waiting for treatment when he became disruptive and combative toward employees, police said. Police cited Williams for disorderly conduct and communicating threats.

"Per hospital protocol, he was banned and escorted out of the building by hospital security," police said in a statement.

Greensboro police officer D.J. Williams helped escort Christian from the hospital, but Christian turned around and walked back toward the entrance of the building, police said.

Williams told Christian he was under arrest, but Christian became unresponsive as he was being handcuffed, police said.

Hospital officials found Christian's pulse while outside the entrance, but his condition quickly deteriorated once inside, police said. He was pronounced dead around 3:30 a.m.

Williams has been placed on administrative duty as is standard procedure. The SBI is investigating the incident, and the hospital is cooperating with the investigation, police said.

No other information has been released.
