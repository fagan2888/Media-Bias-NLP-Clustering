This means it could keep going up.\n\nLastly, the overtime pay regulation goes into effect December 1, 2016.\n\nOne local business with salaried employees says it's not going to be an easy change.\n\n\u201cWe're going to have to do some forecasting,\u201d says Firefli President Greg Brock. \u201cOne of the the things that's most challenging is that we didn't budget for it. So as we get ready to inch towards December we now have to figure out this whole new game that we haven't even anticipated yet.\u201d\n\nHedges says there won\u2019t be any way for businesses to get around the new legislation.\n\n\u201cOne way or the other you're going to either pay somebody an hourly rate or you're going to have to fall into the guidelines with the new legislation,\u201d says Hedge.\n\nHedges says you could see some salaries change to hourly rates.\n\nHe says Businesses are going to have to really examine the roles of their salaried employees using a duties test.\n\nThis test will determine whether or not a salaried employee is exempt from overtime.\n\nIf an employee is making more than the nearly $47,000 threshold and meets the requirements from the duties test are exempt from overtime.\n\nOn the other hand, if you make more than the threshold but don't meet the requirements of the duties test by law, according to the department of labor, your employer must give you overtime pay.\n\nJobs that typically pass the duties test are administrative or managerial position.\n\nWDBJ7 reached out to Representative Bob Goodlatte about the new regulation. He\u2019s opposed to the legislation:\n\n\u201cFolks in the Roanoke Valley want the opportunity to work hard, provide for their family, and earn the chance for a brighter future. The Administration\u2019s recent overtime rule slams the door on those opportunities, forcing American businesses to choose between creating new jobs and complying with new bureaucratic rules from Washington, D.C. For those companies who can least afford to comply with this new rule \u2013 non-profits, colleges and universities, start-ups, small businesses \u2013 forcing them to make such drastic changes in the basic structures of their business plans will mean job cuts, reduced hours, and fewer opportunities for the future. For Virginians already working less because of the negative effects of Obamacare, this new overtime rule is another threat to job security and a bright future for millions of Americans. The House is prepared to look at all options available to stop this rule, and will work toward bipartisan solutions that will help grow the economy and create private sector jobs.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Payroll Management President Christopher Hedges says there are three major components to this new regulation.", "language": "english", "author": "Amanda Kenney", "og": {"url": "http://www.wdbj7.com/content/news/Breaking-down-the-new-overtime-pay-regulation-380181761.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/over+time+pay.png", "type": "article", "description": "Payroll Management President Christopher Hedges says there are three major components to this new regulation.", "title": "Breaking down the new overtime pay regulation"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "fb": {"pages": 26382032216}, "keywords": "Breaking down the new overtime pay regulation", "google-site-verification": "zsPQIzCatWXxSvTOq7dzXzlwet9V1Uq28X-_AouvZh8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Breaking down the new overtime"}, "article_summary": "The Obama Administration's new regulation will raise the salary threshold at which companies can deny overtime pay.\nFor Virginians already working less because of the negative effects of Obamacare, this new overtime rule is another threat to job security and a bright future for millions of Americans.\nMillions of salaried workers will be eligible for overtime pay at the end of the year.\nFirst, the salary threshold has been raised to nearly $47,000 a year.\nLastly, the overtime pay regulation goes into effect December 1, 2016."}
