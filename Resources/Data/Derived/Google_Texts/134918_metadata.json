Gov. Gary Herbert, a Republican, sparked this year\u2019s debate when he included a footnote in his budget counting on $10 million from taxing e-cigarettes.\n\n\u201cI feel strongly that we should tax electronic cigarettes similar to the way we tax other tobacco products,\u201d said Herbert, calling it a \u201cpublic health issue.\u201d Herbert and supportive lawmakers say a tax would slow the growing use of electronic cigarettes while raising revenue for the state.\n\n\u201cThere are some who think these new products are not harmful, but just like traditional cigarettes, they contain nicotine and other toxic and addictive substances,\u201d Herbert said. \u201cFlavoring and marketing targeted to make these products enticing to youth is particularly concerning.\u201d Without being specific, Herbert called for a tax on e-cigarettes \u201csimilar\u201d to the taxes on cigarettes, cigars and snuff.\n\nRelated: Chances Are Your Co-Worker Is High on Pot\n\nBut e-cigarette users say the devices should not be subject to the excise taxes levied on traditional cigarettes. They argue that the devices are healthier, and liken them to nicotine patches and nicotine gum, which help smokers reduce their dependence on cigarettes and are not subject to excise taxes.\n\nJones, a former mixed martial arts fighter, said he gave up traditional cigarettes and turned to \u201cvaping\u201d because \u201csports and cigarettes don\u2019t mix.\u201d As for the candy flavors, Jones argues that \u201cadults like candy, too,\u201d citing \u201cgummy bear\u201d adult vitamins and designer chocolates.\n\nStates Propose Taxes\n\nMinnesota and North Carolina already tax e-cigarettes. Last year, e-cigarette tax proposals were introduced in 12 other states: Delaware, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont and Washington, according to Tobacco E-News, an industry publication for sellers of tobacco and nicotine products. None of them passed.\n\nWith the popularity of e-cigarettes growing, more states are more likely to look to the new devices for revenue. Last Friday, Republican Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder vetoed a package of bills designed to regulate and tax e-cigarettes, saying it wasn\u2019t tough enough. His veto sets the stage for further debate in the legislature this year.\n\nRelated: E-Cig Sellers Make the Most of Regulatory Breathing Room\n\n\u201cThis is going to be one of the most introduced and debated topics in state legislatures this year, especially the tax issue,\u201d said Max Behlke, analyst for the National Conference of State Legislatures. Behlke noted with fewer people smoking traditional cigarettes, a revenue stream that states depend on is decreasing. Taxing electronic cigarettes is a way to recoup some of that money.\n\nUtah state Rep. Paul Ray, a Republican, proposed a bill last year to tax e-cigarettes that would have amounted to about an 86 percent tax on the product, about the equivalent of the amount Utah taxes cigars. The state\u2019s cigarette tax is $1.70 a pack. He argues that young people who have never smoked are taking up the electronic version and his tax is aimed at preventing them from starting. \u201cI\u2019m not doing it for the revenue,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m doing it to keep it away from kids.\u201d\n\nUtah state Sen. Curt Bramble, Republican, who is incoming president of the National Conference of State Legislatures and whose committee would consider any bill to tax e-cigarettes, said the debate will revolve around whether e-cigarettes are an entryway to traditional tobacco products or a tool to help people stop using them. \u201cWhile it\u2019s true from the data that e-cigarettes are a great way to break the habit of smoking, there are those who also claim that e-cigarettes are enticing people to take up the habit because of the flavors and because it\u2019s the \u2018in\u2019 thing to do,\u201d he said. Bramble said extending taxation of tobacco taxes to e-cigarette products would be appropriate.\n\nTwo Styles\n\nE-cigarette products come in two styles. One is a cigarette-like tube, which is generally sold for about $10 in convenience stores, and has self-contained batteries, chargers and liquid tanks. The other is a specialty device with a larger battery, around the size of a traditional cigarette pack. That version allows a user to change liquid flavors, and is generally sold in specialty vapor shops. A starter kit goes for about $25-$35.\n\nRelated: WHO Urges Regulatory Curbs on E-Cigarettes\n\nAll of the devices require bottles of liquid nicotine which vary in strength and size (though there are some versions without nicotine). The cigarette-like tubes already contain the liquid. The bottles cost about $4 for 10 milliliters, enough for hundreds of puffs. The flavors vary from chocolate mint and coffee to lemon and lime and cotton candy. Some of the smaller devices are sold in packs, resembling cigarette packs, and are products of tobacco companies, such as the R.J. Reynolds \u201cVUSE\u201d brand. A user inhales the device\u2019s vapor, just like inhaling smoke from cigarettes.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the percentage of adults who have used an e-cigarette at least once rose from 3.3 percent in 2010 to 8.5 percent in 2013. The percentage of current cigarette smokers who have used an e-cigarette increased from 9.8 percent in 2010 to 36.5 percent in 2013, the CDC said. Former cigarette smokers who have used an e-cigarette increased from 2.5 percent in 2010 to 9.6 percent in 2013.\n\nThe use of e-cigarettes by young people also shows an uptick. In its latest report on youth and cigarette smoking, the Utah Department of Health young people were more likely to report the use of electronic cigarettes than regular cigarettes. Some 3.9 percent of teens and pre-teens that Utah surveyed last year reported smoking cigarettes, while 5.8 percent reported using e-cigarettes.\n\nThe University of Michigan\u2019s \u201cMonitoring the Future\u201d study, which tracks children and youth, showed in December 2014 that among teens, the use of e-cigarettes had surpassed the use of regular cigarettes.\n\nRelated: As Millions Vape, E-Cig Researchers Count Puffs, Scour Facebook\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration is in the process of writing regulations for electronic cigarettes. In the meantime, a handful of states have prohibited their sale to minors and have passed laws banning their use in public buildings. In Utah, the signs say \u201cno smoking or e-cigarettes\u201d on the patio at the Buffalo Wild Wings in Midvale, packed to overflowing for the NFL playoffs. The debate has gone national as well, with the American Vaping Association, based in New Jersey, on the side of the e-cigarettes and the Tobacco Free Kids organization opposed.\n\nA \u2018No-Tax State\u2019 Tax?\n\nIn Indiana, lawmakers and the attorney general are backing legislation that would regulate and tax e-cigarettes. The tax would be assessed \u201csimilarly to traditional tobacco products\u201d according to Attorney General Greg Zoeller, who did not provide more specifics. The bill also would require \u201cvape shops\u201d to be licensed by the Indiana Alcohol & Tobacco Commission and require that e-cigarette liquids be sold in child-resistant packaging.\n\nIndiana state Reps. Ed Clere, a Republican, and Charlie Brown, a Democrat, are cosponsoring the legislation in the House. \u201cThese stores are popping up everywhere,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI think we should tax them like cigarettes.\u201d Brown said that Republican-controlled Indiana is generally a \u201cno tax\u201d state, but that framing the bill as a public health measure, particularly one that will help the young, is likely to win Republican votes. In addition, there\u2019s the revenue factor. \u201cWe are losing revenue,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not meeting our revenue, and this would be an ideal source of revenue.\u201d\n\nIn some states, lawmakers are making the distinction between imposing new taxes and simply extending an existing tax, such as on the tax on cigarettes, to e-cigarettes. In Washington state, Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee has proposed raising the $3-a-pack cigarette tax by 50-cents a pack as well as levying a tax\u2014he didn\u2019t say how much\u2014on e-cigarettes and vapor products. He said the taxes would raise $56 million.\n\nIn New Jersey, which tried and failed to institute an e-cigarette tax last year, Republican Gov. Chris Christie has again proposed a stiff tax on electronic cigarettes. The proposal would tax packs of small electronic cigarettes the same $2.70 a pack imposed on regular cigarettes. How that would be applied to bottles of electronic cigarette liquid is unclear.\n\nIndustry Response\n\nNorth Carolina, a tobacco producing state, imposed a 5-cent per milliliter tax on the liquid nicotine last year. The relatively modest tax was supported by the R.J. Reynolds tobacco company. Bryan Hatchell, a company spokesman, called the North Carolina approach a \u201clight touch tax\u201d that takes into account the difference between cigarettes and liquid nicotine. The state\u2019s cigarette tax is 45 cents per pack.\n\nBut Reynolds was less pleased with the approach taken by Minnesota, which last year instituted a tax that essentially is equal to the $2.90 a pack rate of ordinary cigarettes. \u201cThis has had the effect of pricing vapor products far higher than cigarettes and discouraging traditional smokers from switching to a smoke-free alternative,\u201d Hatchell said.\n\nVapor backers tend to agree. Aaron Frazier, executive director of the Utah Smoke-Free Association, swears by the devices as a smoking-cessation tool and is trying to make his case to the Utah lawmakers this year. Frazier\u2019s group requires members to abide by a list of rules, including taking firm steps to enforce not selling to minors (19 years old in Utah, but 18 in most other states), and pledging not to sell liquid marijuana. The THC liquids (the active ingredient in marijuana) for e-cigarettes are outlawed in all but Colorado and Washington, but opponents of e-cigarettes argue the devices can be used to ingest marijuana products as well.\n\nBrian Fisher, 31, a truck driver from Spanish Fork, Utah, and a member of the smoke-free group, says the devices saved his life. Diagnosed with lymphoma five years ago, \u201cI tried everything to get off cigarettes, and couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d he said. \u201cI found out about vaporizers and they saved me, basically. I want to share this with everyone I know.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in Stateline, a nonpartisan, nonprofit news service of the Pew Center on the States that provides daily reporting and analysis on trends in state policy.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "SUNSET, Utah - Taking a long inhale and blowing a cloud of vapor, Jason Jones, who has", "title": "The Heated Battle to Tax Electronic Cigarettes", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/23/Heated-Battle-Tax-Electronic-Cigarettes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02232015_E-Cigarette.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/23/Heated-Battle-Tax-Electronic-Cigarettes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02232015_E-Cigarette.jpg", "creator": "@espovich", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "SUNSET, Utah - Taking a long inhale and blowing a cloud of vapor, Jason Jones, who has", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI feel strongly that we should tax electronic cigarettes similar to the way we tax other tobacco products,\u201d said Herbert, calling it a \u201cpublic health issue.\u201d Herbert and supportive lawmakers say a tax would slow the growing use of electronic cigarettes while raising revenue for the state.\nThe proposal would tax packs of small electronic cigarettes the same $2.70 a pack imposed on regular cigarettes.\nChris Christie has again proposed a stiff tax on electronic cigarettes.\nTaxing electronic cigarettes is a way to recoup some of that money.\nRelated: As Millions Vape, E-Cig Researchers Count Puffs, Scour FacebookThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration is in the process of writing regulations for electronic cigarettes."}
