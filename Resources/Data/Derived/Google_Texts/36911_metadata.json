Completion is expected in September.

(TRIBUNE/Rand Middleton)\n\nWILLMAR \u2014 Water leaks from worn-out copper pipes in the Lakeview Highrise apartments got so bad that the office staff had to protect the copier and computer with waterproof barbecue grill covers before leaving for the night.\n\n\u201cThere have been leaks that have destroyed a copy machine that was only about a year old. We just can\u2019t replace it again,\u2019\u2019 said Jill Bengtson, executive director of Kandiyohi County Housing and Redevelopment Authority, the agency that owns Lakeview, a low-income apartment building on Seventh Street Northwest in Willmar.\n\nThe severity of the leakage in the copper plumbing throughout in the 44-year-old building is the main reason the HRA received a $2,257,000 safety and energy efficiency improvement grant in February from the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency.\n\nThe grant will help pay for a $2.5 million plumbing replacement project set to begin this coming fall or winter and be completed in 16 months.\n\nThe Lakeview grant was among nearly $18 million in grants awarded by Minnesota Housing for repairs to 35 low-income public housing developments statewide; most were built in the 1970s with federal government financing.\n\nBengtson said 2014 was the third time that the Minnesota Legislature set special money aside for housing authorities to repair public housing projects, and this was the first time that Kandiyohi County HRA applied for and received a grant.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really thankful for it,\u2019\u2019 Bengston said. \u201cWe did a 20-year capital improvement plan. We had just finished it two months before the request for proposals was released. The water pipe (problem) was a big-ticket item in our capital improvement plan. We were able to document to really show the need. We had an architect that completed the plan for us.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe seven-story Lakeview building has 127 one-bedroom units and a two-bedroom caretaker unit. It is home to a variety of college students, singles, elderly and disabled people. Bengtson said tenants will notice new bathroom vanities and plumbing fixtures in their apartments. No other changes are planned.\n\nMajor changes are underway, however, at Highland Apartments, 115 Becker Ave. S.E., where the HRA has begun a\n\n$3.6 million remodeling and renovation project. Completion is expected in September.\n\n\u201cIt will be a big makeover,\u2019\u2019 said Dale Slagter with the HRA rehab program. Demolition and construction are already underway and include redoing the north and south parking lots, new landscaping, new steel roof, new 16-foot by 40-foot addition for common areas, and new windows, kitchens, flooring, bathrooms and painting.\n\nBengtson said this is the first major rehab since the apartment building was constructed in 1978. The building is owned by a limited partnership and Kandiyohi County HRA is general manager.\n\nThe three-story building has 78 units and is home to low-income seniors and disabled individuals. In addition, Minnesota Senior Care has an office there and provides assisted living services to some households.\n\nThe construction cost is part of a $6,396,000 package that includes refinancing existing debt and financing costs.\n\nPlanning for the project began about two years ago. The HRA applied for and was awarded federal low-income housing tax credits funneled through Minnesota Housing Finance Agency to pay for the project.\n\nHousing tax credits provide a dollar-for-dollar tax credit for affordable housing investments. It was created under the Tax Reform Act of 1986 that gives incentives for the use of private equity in the development of affordable housing aimed at low-income Americans.\n\n\u201cSouthwest Minnesota Housing Partnership wrote the funding application for us and is providing construction management oversight during the rehab of the building,\u2019\u2019 Bengtson said.\n\nRenovation is taking place in sections of six to 10 apartments per section. Each section will take three to four weeks to complete. While their apartments are being renovated, residents are being temporarily housed at Suite Liv\u2019n, an extended stay residential business on Business 71 North.\n\nBengtson said the HRA contracted with Suite Liv\u2019n to provide temporary housing. Bengtson said residents were anxious at first about moving. \u201cChange is big deal for them and a different routine for them. Now it\u2019s a little bit quieter,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nHighland apartments", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,local,Kandiyohi County,lakeview,Highland,construction,Housing and Redevelopment Authority,apartments,renovations,low-income housing,Grant", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "David Little", "og": {"site_name": "West Central Tribune", "description": "WILLMAR \u2014 Water leaks from worn-out copper pipes in the Lakeview Highrise apartments got so bad that the office staff had to protect the copier and computer with waterproof barbecue grill covers before leaving for the night.\r\n\u201cThere have been leaks that have destroyed a copy machine that was onl...", "title": "Kandiyohi County Housing and Redevelopment Authority to repair...", "url": "http://www.wctrib.com/news/local/3700693-kandiyohi-county-housing-and-redevelopment-authority-repair-lakeland-and-highland", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.wctrib.com/sites/default/files/styles/square_300/public/fieldimages/37/0315/031615.n.wct.highland-apt3.jpg?itok=qPM23_dt", "height": 300}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "WILLMAR \u2014 Water leaks from worn-out copper pipes in the Lakeview Highrise apartments got so bad that the office staff had to protect the copier and computer with waterproof barbecue grill covers before leaving for the night.\r\n\u201cThere have been leaks that have destroyed a copy machine that was onl...", "title": "Kandiyohi County Housing and Redevelopment Authority to repair...", "url": "http://www.wctrib.com/news/local/3700693-kandiyohi-county-housing-and-redevelopment-authority-repair-lakeland-and-highland", "image": "http://www.wctrib.com/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_430/public/fieldimages/37/0315/031615.n.wct.highland-apt3.jpg?itok=dBIFBC5r", "site": "wctrib", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 125789474255054}, "keywords": "News,local,Kandiyohi County,lakeview,Highland,construction,Housing and Redevelopment Authority,apartments,renovations,low-income housing,Grant", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/westcentraltribune", "tag": "News,local,Kandiyohi County,lakeview,Highland,construction,Housing and Redevelopment Authority,apartments,renovations,low-income housing,Grant", "modified_time": "2015-03-15T22:56:36-05:00"}, "image": {"alt": "Kira Peterson, building manager, and Jill Bengston, director of Kandiyohi County Housing Redevelopment Authority, pause in one of Highland\u2019s 78 apartments scheduled for a makeover, the first since the Willmar building between Becker and Litchfield avenues, Southwest, opened in 1978.
