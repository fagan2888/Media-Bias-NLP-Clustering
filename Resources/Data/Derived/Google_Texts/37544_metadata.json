According to the reports, Charter Communications\u2014which has just over one-third the market capitalization of Time Warner Cable\u2013 is preparing a \u201cbear hug\u201d letter to buy Time Warner Cable for cash and Charter stock.\n\nBear hugs are public approaches in deals where bids aren\u2019t exactly welcome, designed to put pressure on a target company to sell. The idea is that the approach looks amicable enough (hug) but it comes with the pressure of likely public disclosure and shareholder pressure (bear).\n\nThe problem with Charter\u2019s proposal is that in this situation the letter will likely exert very little pressure on Time Warner Cable to accept it. Reports say that the purchase price for the Time Warner Cable shares will be under $135 per share. Time Warner Cable shares closed on Friday at $131.41. And it was trading over $135 most of last month. That probably means there aren\u2019t going to be many anxious shareholders desperate to take Charter\u2019s price. Those stockholders have had ample opportunity to sell for at least as favorable prices.\n\nIn addition, Time Warner Cable doesn\u2019t have any large holders who would likely be concerned that there is insufficient liquidity for them to cash out. Other than two mutual fund companies, Time Warner Cable\u2019s last proxy did not report any shareholders with more than 5% of the stock. And one of the 5% holders reported selling down below 5% over a month ago.\n\nThat reduces the pressure on Time Warner Cable to take Charter\u2019s deal at least somewhat. Of course the Time Warner Cable\u2019s stock has been on a tear since the summer, probably largely in anticipation of a possible deal. The Time Warner Cable board could decide that the Charter deal looks good or could be improved to a level that would be attractive.\n\nPlus Charter\u2019s bear hug could kick off an auction in which the deal price becomes significantly higher. Comcast has been reported to be interested in buying Time Warner Cable as well.\n\nIn terms of takeover defenses, Time Warner Cable is relatively vulnerable, particularly if bidding results in shareholders being offered a substantial premium. All of Time Warner Cable\u2019s directors are elected each year, so Time Warner Cable doesn\u2019t have the defense of a staggered board which can force a hostile bidder to wait over a year to gain control through director elections. This year\u2019s annual meeting was held in May. Under Time Warner Cable\u2019s by-laws, if a hostile bidder wanted to replace directors at the 2014 annual meeting to get its bid approved by the board, nominees would have to be named by mid-February. Charter\u2019s current bid is unlikely to be strong enough to tempt shareholders with such a tactic.\n\nBut much is unknown about this situation. We do not know how Time Warner Cable will react to a definitive proposal. Nor do we know how much Charter is able or ultimately willing to pay if and when Time Warner Cable opens up to a deal or whether Comcast or someone else will enter the fray.\n\nThis deal so far has been playing out slowly and it may take some time to know where the possibility for a deal is headed. But Charter\u2019s bid will be a first step which could ultimately flush out how the various players will react.\n\n(The author owns shares of Time Warner Cable.)\n\nSend questions, comments or story ideas to Dealpolitik@gmail.com and follow Ron on Twitter @Dealpolitik", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The problem with Charter\u2019s proposal is that in this situation the letter will likely exert very little pressure on Time Warner Cable to accept it.", "title": "Dealpolitik: Time Warner Cable Under No Pressure\u2014So Far", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/12/13/dealpolitik-time-warner-cable-under-no-pressure-so-far/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Dealpolitik: Time Warner Cable Under No Pressure\u2014So Far", "description": "The problem with Charter\u2019s proposal is that in this situation the letter will likely exert very little pressure on Time Warner Cable to accept it.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Ronald Barusch", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "The problem with Charter\u2019s proposal is that in this situation the letter will likely exert very little pressure on Time Warner Cable to accept it.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-12-13T23:20:57-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-141", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/12/13/dealpolitik-time-warner-cable-under-no-pressure-so-far/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-13321", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The problem with Charter\u2019s proposal is that in this situation the letter will likely exert very little pressure on Time Warner Cable to accept it.", "title": "Dealpolitik: Time Warner Cable Under No Pressure\u2014So Far", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/12/13/dealpolitik-time-warner-cable-under-no-pressure-so-far/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-13321", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-12-13T23:21:51-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdac01\"", "article_summary": "According to the reports, Charter Communications\u2014which has just over one-third the market capitalization of Time Warner Cable\u2013 is preparing a \u201cbear hug\u201d letter to buy Time Warner Cable for cash and Charter stock.\nReports say that the purchase price for the Time Warner Cable shares will be under $135 per share.\nTime Warner Cable shares closed on Friday at $131.41.\nBloomberg NewsOn Friday published reports indicated that the long expected bidding for Time Warner Cable may start next week.\nIn addition, Time Warner Cable doesn\u2019t have any large holders who would likely be concerned that there is insufficient liquidity for them to cash out."}
