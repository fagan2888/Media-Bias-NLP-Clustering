Whether it\u2019s a daemon or a bug, everyone has a weakness to hide, and the only way to truly know \u2014 and potentially control \u2014 someone is to learn their quirks.\n\nEven though episode five is titled \u201cExploits,\u201d a nod to the caper Elliot and FSociety hope to pull off at Steel Mountain, the title\u2019s secondary meaning revolves around exploiting those weaknesses to break down a person, akin to a hacker accessing a system or network and then exerting total dominance.\n\nFernando Vera wasn\u2019t smart enough to hide his drug dealings and other crimes \u2014 \u201cThis isn\u2019t the imitation game,\u201d his lawyer tells him. \u201cThe code is not that complicated\u201d \u2014 and for the sake of efficiency, he is now facing decades in prison (potentially at a super-max). Fernando likely would have preferred the old-fashioned way of dealing, keeping his name off social media and firmly in the streets, but his younger brother, along with Elliot\u2019s anonymous tip, led to his downfall. \u201cYou know how much money we saved last year?\u201d his brother asks Fernando. \u201cMade our whole operation way more efficient.\u201d\n\nFernando\u2019s sense of the universe is full of checks and balances, making sure each action is satisfied with a countermeasure. He promises someone will get hurt \u2014 \u201cThat\u2019s how we get square with the universe\u201d \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t take much pacing about his cell to figure out who lodged the tip. Shayla is the only real character who has accessed Elliot\u2019s human side, and Fernando\u2019s cosmic retribution doesn\u2019t bode well for the budding couple.\n\nIn upstate New York, Fernando is far from Elliot\u2019s mind \u2014 he\u2019s about to orchestrate the breaking in and legendary hack of Steel Mountain, Evil Corp\u2019s data-storage center. The facility\u2019s tagline is \u201cImpenetrable,\u201d but as Elliot is quick to note, \u201cNothing is actually impenetrable. A place like this says it is, and it\u2019s close, but people still built this place, and if you can hack the right person, all of a sudden you have a piece of powerful malware. People always make the best exploits.\u201d\n\nElliot says he\u2019s never had trouble hacking people, and his latest hack \u2014 Bill Harper, Steel Mountain\u2019s level-one sales associate \u2014 never stood a chance. Elliot uses and abuses Bill in his quest to plant the raspberry pi and manipulate the facility\u2019s temperature settings, analyzing Bill\u2019s weaknesses (his need to be liked) to get Elliot the access he needs. \u201cThink about it, Bill,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you died, would anyone care? Would they really care? Maybe they\u2019d cry for a day \u2026 but no one would give a shit. The few people that would feel obligated to go to your funeral would probably be annoyed and leave as early as possible. That\u2019s who you are. That\u2019s what you are. You\u2019re nothing.\u201d\n\nOne of the show\u2019s hallmarks has been its use of camera angles. Sam Esmail and the other directors love to frame Elliot, and the other characters, off to the side or in the corner of the shot, and the wide angle creates a cinematic feeling. It\u2019s also a bit unnerving \u2014 Elliot in this scene, or Fernando in the opening, are thrust into the viewer\u2019s space \u2014 and the angles during Elliot\u2019s vicious takedown, alternating between wide and long, are among the hallmark aspects of episode five.\n\nDespite a few hiccups (the expected supervisor never materializes, so Romero and Mobley have to improvise), Elliot is free, a humanoid malware ready to infect Steel Mountain until Tyrell, visiting for the day, surprises him.\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear whether Elliot himself doesn\u2019t exist and is a version of Tyrell \u2014 a scenario some have suspected and the show has alluded to throughout the season (and even during the episode, when Elliot says, \u201cI\u2019m talking to you right now and you don\u2019t exist) \u2014 and it\u2019d be the sort of twist that would elevate the show into the pantheon of series debuts. There is some merit to the theory.\n\nElliot is a composite of those around him: Like Mobley and Romero, he is a glutton and control freak, and the tenets of FSociety appeal on some level to Elliot. Even the characters we know are real, like Angela or Gideon, have some connection to both Tyrell and Elliot, who might just be the interim CTO\u2019s hacker persona \u2014 in the midst of puking in the bathroom, Elliot wonders if he is Tyrell\u2019s malware \u2014 that needs to be reined in before he can take over the company. (Why else would Tyrell invite Elliot to join Evil Corp?)\n\n\u201cSeems like we both had the idea to work on-site for the day,\u201d says Tyrell conveniently.\n\nBut what is clear is that Evil Corp is, well, legitimately evil: Before getting lunch, Tyrell hangs with his besties, a pair of financiers for Hezbollah and ISIS. During lunch, Tyrell shows a similar affinity for hacking people, intoning about the waiter, \u201cI wonder what must he think of himself? His life\u2019s potential, reached at $30,000 a year salary, an economy car he still owes money on \u2026 I couldn\u2019t bear \u2026 the life of an ordinary cockroach whose biggest value is to serve me salad.\u201d\n\nRami Malek\u2019s facial expressions have been on point throughout the season, but they really are amplified this episode. When the security officials visit Tyrell and Elliot during lunch, Malek\u2019s face undergoes a wide range of emotions \u2014 from \u201cshitting his pants\u201d nervous to \u201cstay cool\u201d calm \u2014 in just a few seconds, convincing me that there\u2019s no other actor who could play Elliot, someone who could convey an emotional state without the crutch of music or script.\n\nElliot realizes his rendezvous with Tyrell has brought him to Steel Mountain\u2019s level two, and he installs the raspberry pi before Tyrell interrupts him. Like a know-it-all (another trait he conveniently shares with Romero), Elliot has already listed his weaknesses \u2014 doesn\u2019t like being outside and likes morphine too much \u2014 but perhaps Tyrell is just much better at hacking people, and he quickly highlights Elliot\u2019s bug and monster, which we\u2019ve known all along is his father.\n\n\u201cI know you framed Terry Colby,\u201d says Tyrell. \u201cYour father worked at Evil Corp before he died \u2026 I just wanted to know your weakness, and now I do. Revenge. How ordinary. It\u2019s like our water. But even extraordinary people, and I believe you are, are driven by human banalities, and unfortunately we are all human. Except me, of course.\u201d\n\nTyrell flies back to NYC in Evil Corp\u2019s helicopter to meet with Scott Knowles (Brian Stokes Mitchell), who appears set to displace Tyrell as CTO, and Sharon (Michele Hicks), his wife. It\u2019s a classic blackmail tag-team, with both Tyrell and Joanna attempting to find an entry to exploit. The men talk business and the women talk interior design, but it\u2019s rocky at first. He tries to pitch himself as Scott\u2019s right hand, who is justifiably suspicious that Tyrell knows of his promotion at all: \u201cI was beginning to wonder why you set this dinner. Four people in the world know about my conversations. Somehow, you\u2019re No. 5.\u201d\n\nOnce the group retires to the living room, the seduction \u2014 which becomes literal \u2014 goes more smoothly. Joanna pretends to be interested in Scott\u2019s oenophilia, and Tyrell, after making an off comment to Sharon (\u201cHow do you not blow your brains out being married to him?\u201d), guesses right: Sharon is bored, not to mention tired of her husband\u2019s flirting. Tyrell follows her to the bathroom, and although no words are exchanged \u2014 she on the toilet, he standing in front of her \u2014 she falls for Tyrell\u2019s play, who has now found how to exploit his rival, which, for someone as manipulative as Tyrell, could mark an early end for Scott\u2019s CTO tenure.\n\nAll FSociety needs to bring down the worldwide conglomerate and right society\u2019s inequalities is the Dark Army, a deal that Darlene is on the verge of completely destroying. Chatting with the \"world\u2019s most dangerous hacking crew\" in an IRC, Darlene learns FSociety is on its own. The Dark Army has backed out, which Cisco tells her wasn\u2019t a snap decision. \u201cFace it, Darlene, it\u2019s over,\u201d he says. \u201cBetween us, they were out before you ever got to Steel Mountain. I know you had your heart set, but for real this time, let go.\u201d\n\nThe notion that Darlene, more so than anyone else in FSociety, wants to bring down Evil Corp is one I wish the show would further elaborate. Why does Darlene care so much? It is understandable why Elliot and Angela harbor such ill will, so did Darlene similarly lose a parent? Did Evil Corp inflict some previous pain on her or her family? I hope there is some explanation in future episodes, because her gung-ho hacking attitude just doesn\u2019t make sense without any background.\n\nElliot\u2019s road-trip crew return to Coney Island, where Darlene delivers news of the Dark Army\u2019s reversal. At this point in the season, most viewers, including myself, are convinced Mr. Robot isn\u2019t real but instead a figment of Elliot\u2019s imagination. But the goal of this episode is to convince us that Mr. Robot exists. He swipes a Steel Mountain security card; he coaches Elliot through the cavernous complex; he argues with Darlene and destroys equipment \u2014 the first time all season where there is definitive interaction with a character other than Elliot.\n\nThis episode forced me to alter my viewpoint, and I believe that since Elliot is our guide to this world, Mr. Robot is real when Elliot needs him to be. That is to say, there are scenes when Mr. Robot isn\u2019t actually there: the hotel room during episode four\u2019s detox, or even in the car giving Elliot pointers on how to break into Steel Mountain. Mr. Robot is always in the backseat of the car, out of view of the other characters, and he exists only in Elliot\u2019s mind.\n\nBut then there are instances where Elliot fades from view and he transforms into Mr. Robot. These are the scenes, like at the end of this week\u2019s episode, when he sparks interaction. At the arcade headquarters, Elliot is at the back of the room, letting Mr. Robot, his daemon take over. We see Mr. Robot, but Darlene and the others see Elliot (or at least that is how I think Esmail is proceeding). This is the first instance in which we\u2019ve seen Elliot become Mr. Robot \u2014 it is still a bit Tyler Durden\u2013esque, but with a twist.\n\nAdditional Thoughts", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#00bcf1", "description": "Everyone has a weakness to hide.", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "Vulture", "description": "Everyone has a weakness to hide.", "title": "Mr. Robot Recap: People Always Make the Best Exploits", "url": "http://www.vulture.com/2015/07/mr-robot-recap-season-1-episode-5.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/07/23/23-mr-robot.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/07/23/23-mr-robot.w750.h560.2x.jpg", "description": "Everyone has a weakness to hide.", "site": "@vulture", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Mr. Robot Recap: People Make the Best Exploits"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vulture", "fb": {"app_id": 158902697551841}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/vulture/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "Vulture", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "mr. robot, tv, tv recaps, recaps, overnights", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture", "tag": "mr. robot,tv,tv recaps,recaps,overnights", "published_time": "2015-07-23T13:27:00.000Z"}, "topics": "topics-test, mr. robot, tv, tv recaps, recaps, overnights", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb85e\"", "article_summary": "Robot, but Darlene and the others see Elliot (or at least that is how I think Esmail is proceeding).\nThis episode forced me to alter my viewpoint, and I believe that since Elliot is our guide to this world, Mr.\nThis is the first instance in which we\u2019ve seen Elliot become Mr.\nRobot is always in the backseat of the car, out of view of the other characters, and he exists only in Elliot\u2019s mind.\nBut then there are instances where Elliot fades from view and he transforms into Mr."}
