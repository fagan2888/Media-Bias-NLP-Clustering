Long considered the land of dreams, the Golden State has a history of innovation, from the 1800's-era forty-niners to today\u2019s technology hopefuls. That\u2019s perhaps especially true for immigrants of all kinds, according to a policy brief published today by the University of California-Riverside.\n\nThrough a unique set of laws, California offers unauthorized immigrants a level of opportunity and freedom of movement that is rare elsewhere in the nation. \u201cCalifornia today provides the most integrationist laws in the country with respect to unauthorized immigrants,\u201d write public policy professor Karthick Ramakrishnan and his student, Allan Colbern, authors of the policy brief. The result? California offers a de facto state citizenship that\u2019s totally separate from national citizenship \u2014 and more progressive even than the immigration reform President Barack Obama is currently advocating for. Ramakrishnan and Colbern call the state\u2019s immigration laws the \u201cCalifornia Package.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cCalifornia Package\u201d is a combination of laws that offer unauthorized immigrants citizen-like benefits that wouldn\u2019t apply to them if they lived elsewhere, and that demonstrate states\u2019 power over immigrants\u2019 lives:\n\n\u2022 Health Care: California offers health care coverage, including prenatal care, for low-income Californians even if they don\u2019t qualify for coverage through programs such as the Affordable Care Act because of their immigration status. California also makes its Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program available to undocumented immigrant children.\n\n\u2022 Education: Any child who has spent enough time attending California schools qualifies for in-state tuition at California colleges.\n\n\u2022 Freedom of Movement: Undocumented immigrants can get driver\u2019s licenses in California. This is true in 10 other states, too.\n\n\u2022 Freedom to Work: Unauthorized immigrants are able to qualify for the California state bar. In 2016, they\u2019ll be eligible for 40 state professional licenses. The federal government offers a database called E-Verify that lets companies easily check the authorization status of potential employees. Arizona requires all employers use E-Verify; California bans any municipality from instating such a requirement.\n\nYet the California Package is just one example of how state laws now matter more to immigrants\u2019 legal rights than federal laws do, the researchers argue. That is, state-level power can work for and against immigrants. For example, California\u2019s neighboring state, Arizona, is one of the nation\u2019s most exclusionary of immigrants. It has laws on the books that punish companies more severely than federal laws do for hiring undocumented workers, and require police to check the immigration status of anyone they deem suspicious. Arizona and four other states deny in-state tuition even to fully documented, \u201clegal\u201d immigrants. Meanwhile, unauthorized immigrants who attended a California elementary or high school for at least three years are eligible for in-state tuition and state-funded scholarships, grants, and loans. Undocumented immigrants can qualify for the California state bar, and by 2016, they\u2019ll be eligible for 39 other professional licenses, too. California and Arizona are states located in a similar geographic area, with historically similar influxes of immigrants, that chose to deal with the issue very differently.\n\nState power offers a whole new way of thinking about citizenship, as separate from being a citizen of the United States, Ramakrishnan and Colbern write. For lobbying groups, state governments represent an opportunity to win rights where national efforts, such as the repeated efforts to pass a national DREAM Act, failed. (To be sure, California\u2019s Dream Act passed in 2011.) Some groups have already taken notice and shifted their funding, Ramakrishnan and Colbern learned from interviews.", "article_metadata": {"description": "by Francie Diep \u00b6\n\nThere\u2019s something special about living in California.
