Somin - who explained to Reason TV in 2012 why he thought the individual mandate was unconstitutional and a threat to liberty - contends that citizen ignorance is a major problem because it leaves government power essentially unchecked and unaccountable.\n\nAs Will summarizes:\n\nVoters cannot hold officials responsible if they do not know what government is doing, or which parts of government are doing what. Given that 20 percent thinks the sun revolves around the Earth, it is unsurprising that a majority is unable to locate major states such as New York on a map. Usually only 30 percent of Americans can name their two senators. The average American expends more time becoming informed about choosing a car than choosing a candidate. But, then, the consequences of the former choice are immediate and discernible....\n\nA typical argument is that such rational ignorance on the part of voters can be remedied by getting voters to become more knowledgeable. Somin goes in a different direction, says Will:\n\nA better ameliorative measure would be to reduce the risks of ignorance by reducing government\u2019s consequences \u2014 its complexity, centralization and intrusiveness. In the 19th century, voters\u2019 information burdens were much lighter because important federal issues \u2014 the expansion of slavery, the disposition of public lands, tariffs, banking, infrastructure spending \u2014 were much fewer.\n\nRead the whole thing. And watch Somin discuss Obamacare below.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "George Will has an interesting column about Democracy and Political Ignorance: Why Smaller Government is Smarter, by George Mason University's Ilya Somin.", "title": "The Best Answer to Voter Ignorance?
