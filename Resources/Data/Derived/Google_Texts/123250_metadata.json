Some local officials advocate using state gas tax revenue to dredge the waterway. (provided)\n\nAn increase in the state gas tax that is being considered in Columbia could be used to provide much-needed funds for dredging the ailing Intracoastal Waterway, local officials said.\n\n\u201cI think the gas tax is basically a transportation tax so I do think it could justifiably be used for waterway dredging. I encourage our state leaders to research what has been done elsewhere along the waterway,\u201d said Charleston County Councilman Dickie Schweers.\n\nThe Florida Inland Navigation District collects about $20 million annually in property taxes to pay for waterway maintenance in 12 counties.\n\nNorth Carolina raises funds for waterway dredging through its gas tax and boater registration fees.\n\nGov. Nikki Haley, in her State of the State address Wednesday, expressed support for increasing South Carolina\u2019s 26.75 cents per gallon gas tax by up to 10 cents over three years to fund roads if the state income tax is reduced from 7 percent to 5 percent.\n\nWhether Haley would support spending gas tax money for waterway maintenance is unknown. As of late Friday afternoon, the governor\u2019s office had not responded to phone and e-mail requests for comment on the issue.\n\nMcClellanville Mayor Rutledge Leland said that the shallow, muddy condition of the waterway at low tide keeps shrimp and fish boats moored at the docks.\n\n\u201cWe have a (marine) road out here that certainly needs some help. The situation is not good. It\u2019s on everybody\u2019s mind,\u201d he said.\n\nCounty Council has designated $500,000 as seed money for waterway dredging if \u201csubstantial\u201d matching funds are provided.\n\n\u201cWe believe that Florida, North Carolina and more recently Charleston County have set an example on how to step up to assist in maintaining the waterway,\u201d said Brad Pickel, Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway Association executive director.\n\nThe waterway runs from Norfolk, Va., to Key West, Fla., a distance of about 1,200 miles. It was authorized in the 1939 Rivers and Harbors Act. The Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for its maintenance.\n\nIt is a travel route for the Coast Guard, barge traffic, commercial and charter fishing vessels, recreational and tour boats. A variety of products are shipped on the marine highway including fuel oil, fertilizers, wood, iron, steel, vegetables, produce and electrical machinery, according to the waterway association.\n\nDavid Warren, a project manager for the Army Corps of Engineers Charleston District, said he is informing Congress of the availability of the $500,000 in matching county money and seeking approval to spend it on the waterway.\n\nCurrently, the Corps has $500,000 in federal funds for waterway maintenance. Warren said it will be used for mosquito abatement, condition surveys and preparation of specifications and plans for shovel-ready projects if more money becomes available for dredging. About $3 million would be needed to dredge the worst spots in the county at McClellanville and at Breach Inlet between Sullivan\u2019s Island and Isle of Palms, he said.\n\nThe waterway was last dredged in South Carolina in 2010 using $4 million in economic stimulus funds made available through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.\n\nThe waterway ideally is 12 feet deep but only a foot of water can be found in some areas when the tide is out. Boaters run aground routinely, officials said.\n\nLeland said he planned to contact the governor\u2019s office and legislators about the possibility of using some gas tax money for waterway dredging.\n\n\u201cIt would seem appropriate,\u201d he said.\n\nReach Prentiss Findlay at 937-5711", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Ailing Intracoastal Waterway could be dredged using state gas tax money, local officials say, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Army Corps of Engineers,Dickie Schweers,Intracoastal Waterway,Isle of Palms,Rutledge Leland,Sullivan's Island", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "An increase in the state gas tax that is being considered in Columbia could be used to provide much-needed funds for dredging the ailing Intracoastal Waterway, local officials said.", "title": "Ailing Intracoastal Waterway could be dredged using state gas tax money, local officials say", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150125/150129570/ailing-intracoastal-waterway-could-be-dredged-using-state-gas-tax-money-local-officials-say", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150125/PC16/150129570/AR/0/AR-150129570.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150125/PC16/150129570/AR/0/AR-150129570.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An increase in the state gas tax that is being considered in Columbia could be used to provide much-needed funds for dredging the ailing Intracoastal Waterway, local officials said.", "title": "Ailing Intracoastal Waterway could be dredged using state gas tax money, local officials say", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150125/PC16/150129570/AR/0/AR-150129570.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150129570}}, "keywords": "Ailing Intracoastal Waterway could be dredged using state gas tax money, local officials say , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Army Corps of Engineers,Dickie Schweers,Intracoastal Waterway,Isle of Palms,Rutledge Leland,Sullivan's Island", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-25T22:13:37Z", "modified_time": "2015-01-25T22:13:00Z", "author": "Prentiss Findlay"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "An increase in the state gas tax that is being considered in Columbia could be used to provide much-needed funds for dredging the ailing Intracoastal Waterway, local officials said."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddf0b\"", "article_summary": "Some local officials advocate using state gas tax revenue to dredge the waterway.\nLeland said he planned to contact the governor\u2019s office and legislators about the possibility of using some gas tax money for waterway dredging.\n\u201cI think the gas tax is basically a transportation tax so I do think it could justifiably be used for waterway dredging.\nWhether Haley would support spending gas tax money for waterway maintenance is unknown.\n(provided)An increase in the state gas tax that is being considered in Columbia could be used to provide much-needed funds for dredging the ailing Intracoastal Waterway, local officials said."}
