Instead of $28 million, the Washington Health Benefit Exchange spent $18 million on advertising, lowering the total Obamacare marketing campaign to $674 million. The spokesperson also said the state received $90,000 in additional funds to promote the law in January.\n\n_\n\nPresident Barack Obama contended that the government did not \u201cmake a hard sell\u201d for Obamacare, despite his administration spending nearly $700 million to promote the law.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t make a hard sell,\u201d Obama said in the Rose Garden on Tuesday, praising the 7.1 million sign ups for the Affordable Care Act. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have billions of dollars of commercials like some critics did.\u201d\n\nHowever, last July the Associated Press reported that Obamacare\u2019s marketing campaign would cost at least $684 million.\n\nTaxpayer funding went to all 50 states in efforts to encourage people to enroll, including nearly $28 million for the Washington Health Benefit Exchange, for television, radio, print, and social media ads.\n\nOregon received $10 million to push the law, which it used to create advertisements that did not even mention the word \u201cinsurance.\u201d\n\nThe Portland advertising agency North, Inc., produced psychedelic cartoons for Cover Oregon that were described by Sen. Tom Coburn\u2019s (R., Okla.) Wastebook as \u201cwhat appears to be Gumby riding on the Beatles\u2019 yellow submarine.\u201d\n\nAnother ad, \u201cLive Long in Oregon,\u201d featured a woman singing a hippie folk song on a guitar, with lyrics such as \u201clong live the Oregon spirit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever it takes to get them there, so whether it\u2019s, y\u2019know, a woman strumming a guitar, or whether it\u2019s a rap, hopefully that message is there,\u201d said Cover Oregon Chief Operating Officer Triz de la Rosa.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the White House also had staffers actively promoting the law, using everything from \u201cdoge\u201d memes to cat GIFs to encourage sign ups. The administration gave the Baltimore Ravens $130,000 to sell Obamacare.\n\nObama himself appeared on Zach Galifianakis\u2019 show \u201cBetween Two Ferns\u201d to pitch the health care law.\n\nObamacare got help from nonprofit organizations, where alcohol was used to sell insurance in Colorado. The so-called \u201cBrosurance\u201d campaign, depicted keg stands to try to encourage young people to sign up. Enroll America, also a nonprofit, made a rapping pug video to promote the law.\n\nIllinois recently paid the online satirical site the Onion up to $300,000 for online banner ads. One ad linking to the Cover Illinois website read: \u201cMan without health insurance forced to sell action figures to pay for medical bills. Don\u2019t sell your action figures.\u201d\n\nThe funding was on top of the $33.3 million Illinois spent on marketing the law, despite signing up just 13 percent of the state\u2019s uninsured.\n\nMuch of the funding went to the Jayne Agency, a Chicago-based advertising firm that helped market the law, whose slogan is \u201cCreative that rocks. Not costly politics.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Doge memes, cat GIFs, $10 million on cartoon ads belie president\u2019s claim that feds did not \u2018make a hard sell\u2019", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "UPDATE April 4, 3:30 P.M.:\u00a0A spokesperson for the Washington exchange informed the Free Beacon that its marketing budget cited in the July AP report was inaccurate. \u00a0Instead of $28 million, the Wash", "title": "Gov\u2019t Spent $700 Million Promoting Obamacare", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/govt-spent-700-million-promoting-obamacare/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/GetCovered-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "UPDATE April 4, 3:30 P.M.:\u00a0A spokesperson for the Washington exchange informed the Free Beacon that", "creator": "@LizWFB", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/GetCovered-150x150.jpg", "title": "Gov\u2019t Spent $700 Million Promoting Obamacare", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0e89\"", "article_summary": "Instead of $28 million, the Washington Health Benefit Exchange spent $18 million on advertising, lowering the total Obamacare marketing campaign to $674 million.\n_President Barack Obama contended that the government did not \u201cmake a hard sell\u201d for Obamacare, despite his administration spending nearly $700 million to promote the law.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t make a hard sell,\u201d Obama said in the Rose Garden on Tuesday, praising the 7.1 million sign ups for the Affordable Care Act.\nThe spokesperson also said the state received $90,000 in additional funds to promote the law in January.\nDon\u2019t sell your action figures.\u201dThe funding was on top of the $33.3 million Illinois spent on marketing the law, despite signing up just 13 percent of the state\u2019s uninsured."}
