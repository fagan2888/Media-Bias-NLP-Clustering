Community Health Alliance, Tennessee’s Obamacare health insurance co-op, is offering free smartphones to those who register, as long as they “pledge to stay connected for better health,” the Nashville Business Journal reported.

As part of its Community Health Connection Program, CHA is offering “eligible” individuals smart phones, including unlimited talk, unlimited texting and 1.2GB of data, as part of their health care plans, the report said.

“Members will have the phone number for their CHA representative pre-loaded in their phones and can quickly get answers to questions about their policies,” CHA Chief Operating Officer Judy Slagle said in a statement. “At the same time, we will be able to connect with our members by phone, by email or by text almost instantly with health tips and reminders.”

To be eligible for a phone, members must pay the first month’s premium, select a primary care physician from CHA’s network, and sign an agreement pledging “to stay connected for better health” within 90 days, the Nashville Business Journal reported.

To stay in the program, members must also visit their primary care physician within 180 days of coverage start date.

“Members must act on their pledge,” said CEO Jerry Burgess. “They have 180 days to see their doctor. For people who haven’t had health insurance, this is a critical step. They will be able to work with their doctor to make a plan to improve their health.”
