I\u2019m adding two of my own.\n\nFrom Huffington Post:\n\nSince launching on Oct. 7, 1996, Fox has grown into a reliable ratings juggernaut among cable news stations by elevating bombastic personalities, keeping its coverage unabashedly right-leaning and frequently stoking conservative fears. To commemorate the anniversary of America's most controversial cable network, we've compiled some of the most outlandish, offensive and off-putting moments Fox News has ever aired.\n\nSome of my faves from their list: Megyn Kelly insisting that Santa Claus is white, Andrea Tantaros talking up how good she'd look on a food stamp diet, the War on Christmas, the \u201cterrorist fist jab\u201d and the epic confrontation between the anti-war son of a 9/11 victim and Bill O\u2019Reilly.\n\nBut here are the two I\u2019d add:\n\n1) Sean Hannity\u2019s slavery-apologist pal complaining that, \u201cMost blacks, not all but most in Tennessee, especially in the Memphis, Tennessee area\u201d are \"so racist\" and use race \u201cto intimidate white America.\u201d Hannity refused to allow his other guest to object.\n\n2) Red Eye\u2019s mocking and smearing of the Canadian army which was fighting in one of the most dangerous areas in Afghanistan and taking a disproportionately high number of casualties. The segment caused such an outcry that host Greg Gutfeld was later forced to apologize.\n\nWatch those two below and let me know what you think belong in the list of most ridiculous or outrageous.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "sQ2gDt+oAHMnkPQG02BgPuLk4dO0CFhhHuVLYSXVdEs=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/huffington_post_celebrates_fox_news_birthday_with_19_of_its_worst_moments_101115", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/pages/6802/meta_images/original/Food_stamp_diet_fb.png?1444602420", "type": "article", "title": "Huffington Post Celebrates Fox News\u2019 Birthday With 19 Of Its Worst Moments"}, "Title": "Huffington Post Celebrates Fox News\u2019 Birthday With 19 Of Its Worst Moments"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0e0b\"", "article_summary": "Huffington Post \u201chonored\u201d Fox News\u2019 19th birthday last week in the best way possible: by highlighting its most ridiculous moments, one for each year.\nTo commemorate the anniversary of America's most controversial cable network, we've compiled some of the most outlandish, offensive and off-putting moments Fox News has ever aired.\nWatch those two below and let me know what you think belong in the list of most ridiculous or outrageous.\nFrom Huffington Post:Since launching on Oct. 7, 1996, Fox has grown into a reliable ratings juggernaut among cable news stations by elevating bombastic personalities, keeping its coverage unabashedly right-leaning and frequently stoking conservative fears.\nThe segment caused such an outcry that host Greg Gutfeld was later forced to apologize."}
