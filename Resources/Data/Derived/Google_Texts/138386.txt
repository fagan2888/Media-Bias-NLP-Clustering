Congressman Brad Ashford was the special guest at an Omaha Press Club Noon Forum earlier this month.

Ashford talked about some of the challenges he has faced in his first 90 days in office as well as what he thinks the future will bring.

He said the spirit of the nation must be renewed, which means lawmakers must debate and make decisions on tough issues. He also discussed his experience in Washington so far.

"I liken it to a boxing match. You get into your corner and you get all revved up and you go out and you box for maybe 15 rounds. And at the end of 15 rounds, it’s a draw. You’ve done absolutely nothing and you go back to your corner and get revved up again. That’s what it’s like. And the people are competent. They are good people. The system needs to change.”

Ashford said government either does too little, such as passing the Affordable Care Act without any debate, or does way too little by doing nothing about immigration reform. He said it’s been on the agenda for 12 years and has never been debated.

Congressman Brad Ashford’s presentation will air in its entirety on KIOS on Monday, May 18th at Noon.
