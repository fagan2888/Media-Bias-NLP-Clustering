I don\u2019t mean to suggest that the conflict is in any sense symmetrical. As we have already seen, the worst price for this latest round of violence will be paid by the civilian population of Gaza, almost 2 million people fenced into a slice of arid seacoast with roughly the same land area as the city of Detroit. But for those of us in the West, and especially in the United States, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict plays out in public discourse, over and over again, as a drama of rhetoric and propaganda, accusation and counter-accusation.\n\nBoth in the real conflict on the ground and the ideological conflict for hearts and minds, both sides feel misunderstood and unfairly stigmatized \u2013 and if you\u2019re willing or able to take the long view, they both have a point. Along with every other American journalist, I received emails this week from Arab-American groups complaining about the pro-Israeli bias of the mainstream media, and from Jewish activists eager to elucidate President Obama\u2019s \u201cpro-Muslim agenda\u201d and his long-term campaign to undermine Israel. Within the American left, which for generations has been closely allied with the Jewish intellectual tradition, this ideological combat can often be intensely personal and painful. I\u2019ve managed to stay out of the angry debates between friends and acquaintances in my Facebook feed \u2013 about whether Rachel Maddow is an Israeli shill, or whether American progressives are hypocrites for weeping over Gaza but ignoring the death toll in Iraq, Syria and Egypt \u2013 and I don\u2019t even want to know what kinds of insults people are hurling at each other on Twitter.\n\nWhat do we talk about when we talk about Israel? Perhaps this is an index of our bottomless narcissism, but the not-so-secret subtext of both pro-Israel and anti-Israel arguments is that they\u2019re really debates about America and its role in the world. Israel is of course closely tied to the U.S. in military, economic, cultural and psychological terms, and in all likelihood would not exist if not for six-plus decades of staunch American support. Although it\u2019s a distinctive society in many ways, Israel is also a familiar kind of place \u2013 a Westernized consumer democracy of yoga classes, designer cocktails and gay pride parades \u2013 in a way no Islamic Middle Eastern country even approaches. Israel can be read as an American proxy state, a wayward bastard child or (in the paranoid view) as a sinister force behind American politics, pulling the superpower\u2019s strings. However you understand this \u201cspecial relationship,\u201d the genetic kinship is unmistakable.\n\nEverything about the politics of the Israel-Palestine debate \u2013 which are mostly the politics of guilt, victimhood and mutual, purposeful incomprehension \u2013 is distorted and exacerbated by the gravitational effect of America. As I said earlier, both sides have valid points to make about the nature of that distortion. But I don\u2019t mean to retreat to some journalistic posture of false equivalency and despair: Everybody has done bad things, and it\u2019s just dreadful. Can we get back to watching HBO? That only fuels the hapless status quo, as captured so memorably in Mitt Romney\u2019s phrase about kicking the can down the road, in which the U.S. appears subservient to the Israeli right wing while continuing to advocate for a two-state solution that will never happen. I have no solution to that dilemma, but it\u2019s useful to understand that pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian forces are responding to the same phenomenon \u2013 Israel\u2019s inextricable relationship with the United States \u2013 and interpreting it in different ways.\n\nFirst of all, Israelis and their American allies are justifiably outraged when leftist critics compare Israel to Nazi Germany or apartheid South Africa. It is not excusing Israel\u2019s policy misdeeds or the racist excesses of Israeli settler culture to insist that such comparisons are intellectually lazy and dishonest, and serve only to pour gasoline on an already inflammatory situation. Now, there are specific areas, such as the tormented relationship between the Israeli military and Palestinians under occupation, where those analogies may come much too close for comfort. This was famously observed by no less an authority than former Shin Bet head Avraham Shalom (in the mesmerizing documentary \u201cThe Gatekeepers\u201d), a man who had been born in Vienna and once saw Adolf Hitler speak in person.\n\nBut in the bigger picture, the differences are more striking than the similarities: For all its flaws, Israel is a functioning Western-style democracy that pays lip service to the rule of law and (like most other democracies) occasionally lives up to those promises. Dissent and free speech are generally tolerated, and more than 20 percent of Israeli citizens are Palestinian Arabs, who at least in theory possess full political rights. A dozen Arab Israelis hold seats in the Knesset, and an Arab judge has sat on the Israeli Supreme Court since 2004. There is unquestionably anti-Arab discrimination and ethnic tension between the Jewish and Arab populations, but it is ludicrous to compare that situation to Nazi Germany or South Africa. How many Jews hold similar positions in Muslim-majority nations? For that matter, how many African-Americans served as judges or cops or state legislators in the Jim Crow South?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Israel's harshest critics and most ardent defenders agree on one thing: The battle is really about America", "author": "Andrew O'Hehir", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Israel's harshest critics and most ardent defenders agree on one thing: The battle is really about America", "title": "Israel: America\u2019s Frankenstein monster", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/19/israel_americas_frankenstein_monster/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/israeli_tank.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Israel's harshest critics and most ardent defenders agree on one thing: The battle is really about America", "creator": "@andohehir", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/israeli_tank.jpg", "title": "Israel: America\u2019s Frankenstein monster", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Israel: America\u2019s Frankenstein monster", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Editor's Picks, Gaza, gaza strip, Israel, Israel-Palestine, israeli-palestinian conflict, Palestine, Palestinian, Palestinian state, The Palestinian Authority", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0732\"", "article_summary": "Israel can be read as an American proxy state, a wayward bastard child or (in the paranoid view) as a sinister force behind American politics, pulling the superpower\u2019s strings.\nFirst of all, Israelis and their American allies are justifiably outraged when leftist critics compare Israel to Nazi Germany or apartheid South Africa.\nFor that matter, how many African-Americans served as judges or cops or state legislators in the Jim Crow South?\nWhat do we talk about when we talk about Israel?\nA dozen Arab Israelis hold seats in the Knesset, and an Arab judge has sat on the Israeli Supreme Court since 2004."}
