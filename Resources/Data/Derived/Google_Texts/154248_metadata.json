They need the tools and skills to do it right,\" says Sherine Gabriel, dean of the Mayo Medical School at the Rochester, Minnesota-based Mayo Clinic.\n\nHere are some of the most significant emerging trends.\n\n[Learn about three top reasons medical school applications are rejected.]\n\n1. Face time from the start: Traditionally, the first two years of med school have been spent in the classroom studying basic medical science. But \"people learn much better if they learn a body of knowledge in the context in which it\u2019s going to be used,\" says Bonnie Miller, senior associate dean for health sciences education at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.\n\nSo first-year Vanderbilt students are \"part of the care team,\" she says, conducting interviews with patients in clinics and helping them understand any new drug prescriptions. Second-year students engage in the transition from hospital to home, helping with discharge arrangements and in some cases following up with house calls.\n\nThrough such programs, trainees see how putting the focus on the patient prevents costly readmissions and leads to better health outcomes.\n\n2. Training in multidisciplinary teams: Putting that early training into real-world settings also gives doctors-to-be experience working with other health professionals, a taste of the high-powered team medicine they are expected to practice.\n\n\"In every other industry \u2013 business, aviation, whatever \u2013 in order to be more efficient and get good outcomes, you need to take a team approach,\" says Stephen Klasko, president and CEO of Thomas Jefferson University and Jefferson Health System in Philadelphia. \"The only way for that to happen in medicine is to start from the beginning, in school.\"\n\nMedical students at Jefferson, with students of nursing, pharmacy, physical therapy and other health professions, are assigned to a \"health mentor,\" a patient in the community. The team meets with the person periodically to take histories and create wellness plans. They aren't delivering care per se, but might focus on fixing a safety hazard in a mentor's home or check for drug interactions, all while beginning to understand what the other experts bring to the table.\n\nAt other schools, groups from different disciplines use training exercises to learn how to interact effectively. New York University, for example, pairs medical and nursing students to provide care for \u201cvirtual\u201d patients with conditions ranging from hip fractures to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, using electronic health records and email to communicate.\n\n[Get a peek into the evolution of medical school education.]\n\n3. Developing a sense of social mission: More medical colleges are creating opportunities to help their communities, particularly underserved populations. The strategy: to let students see the health consequences of social and economic inequality, an urgent concern among public health experts.\n\nThe University of North Texas Health Science Center in Fort Worth dispatches students with doctors, nurses and social workers to disadvantaged neighborhoods in a new mobile pediatric unit to administer screenings and vaccines.\n\nIn tiny Eastland, Texas, meanwhile, fourth-year UNT student William Griffin, 28, is completing a rotation in a Rural Osteopathic Medical Education program that has also included stints in several other towns since his first year. \"I\u2019m in a unique position to see the whole spectrum of health care,\" says Griffin, who has helped deliver babies and scrubbed in for surgeries.", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160504_Chinese\",\"text\":\"Upward of 304,000 Chinese students studied in the U.S. during the 2014-2015 academic year.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "From early encounters with patients to a systemic approach, future doctors are getting a different medical school experience.", "zone": "top medical schools", "author": "Beth Howard", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "From early encounters with patients to a systemic approach, future doctors are getting a different medical school experience.", "title": "5 Ways Medical Schools Aim to Teach the Doctors of Tomorrow", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/top-medical-schools/articles/2015/03/18/5-ways-medical-schools-aim-to-teach-the-doctors-of-tomorrow", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/b8/12/f66a96984bddba06924ab0bb6759/g16-816-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "From early encounters with patients to a systemic approach, future doctors are getting a different medical school experience.", "card": "summary", "title": "5 Ways Medical Schools Aim to Teach the Doctors of Tomorrow - US News"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "Best Grad", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/0858c97/2147483647/thumbnail/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2Fb8%2F12%2Ff66a96984bddba06924ab0bb6759%2Fresizes%2F500%2Fg16-816-editorial.jpg", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "keywords": "medical school,medicine,personalized medicine,Affordable Care Act,doctors,graduate schools,Best Graduate Schools,students,education,Beth Howard", "published_at": "2015-03-18", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2015-03-18"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z7lhnp", "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "They need the tools and skills to do it right,\" says Sherine Gabriel, dean of the Mayo Medical School at the Rochester, Minnesota-based Mayo Clinic.\n[Learn about three top reasons medical school applications are rejected.]\n\"I\u2019m in a unique position to see the whole spectrum of health care,\" says Griffin, who has helped deliver babies and scrubbed in for surgeries.\nMedical students and candidates in other health disciplines at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia meet in teams with a health mentor to get experience working together.\n[Get a peek into the evolution of medical school education.]"}
