The average price of a home in Thompson\u2019s Station was $321,682 in November, well below the $475,266 average price in Franklin, according to the Williamson County Association of Realtors. (Photo: Submitted Photo)\n\nIn Williamson County, where the average home price topped $455,000 at the end of the year, is it still possible to find an affordable new house? Josh and Vania Jackson think so.\n\nAfter a disappointing search for a home near downtown Franklin, they looked farther south in Thompson\u2019s Station\u2019s Canterbury neighborhood. That short drive saved them almost $150,000.\n\n\u201cA house like ours was pushing $480,000 in Franklin, literally 10 minutes away,\u201d said Josh Jackson.\n\nThe Jacksons paid $334,000 for their home, which is being built by the Jones Co. That price is close to the average price of a home in Thompson\u2019s Station, which was $321,682 in November, but well below the $475,266 average price in Franklin, according to the Williamson County Association of Realtors.\n\nThe Jacksons\u2019 house features numerous upgrades. The 2,600-square-foot house is on a one-third acre lot and has hardwoods on the main level, wainscoting and a three-car garage. It has a brick exterior, which the Jones Co. provided at the same cost as less expensive Hardie Board siding.\n\nDespite Williamson County\u2019s reputation as an expensive place to buy a house, the couple believe they got the best deal possible. In trendy East Nashville, they found similarly priced new homes, but they were being built two on a lot. In Nashville\u2019s settled West Meade neighborhood, homes in that price range usually needed updating.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not sitting right behind another house, and we\u2019ll have Williamson County schools,\u201d said Jackson.\n\nThere are numerous communities where buyers can find new homes well below Williamson County\u2019s average price, said Jen Lucy, director of sales for the Jones Co.\n\n\u201cMost people who work in Williamson County can buy a home in Williamson County,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the Heartland Reserve neighborhood in Fairview, prices start under $300,000. In the new Summerlyn subdivision in Nolensville, prices start in the $330,000s, she said.\n\n\u201cNolensville is the new Franklin,\u201d said Lucy. \u201cIt\u2019s a great alternative to Franklin, but a little more affordable.\u201d\n\nOther builders also are making a point of offering homes within reach of many buyers. In Beazer Homes\u2019 new Brentwood subdivision, Owl Creek, prices begin at $374,990. In Lochhaven, also in Brentwood, prices begin at $349,990, far below the city\u2019s average price of $658,146.\n\nIn Franklin, Goodall Homes\u2019 prices begin at $368,990 in the Rizer Point subdivision. In Lockwood Glen, homes begin at $376,990.\n\nRegent Homes has houses from the mid-$300,000s in Lockwood Glen, said Jeffrey Caruth, a Realtor for the company. On the south side of the city, Berry Farms condos starts in the $160,000s, he said.\n\n\u201cOwning a home is the American dream. The American dream still exists in Franklin,\u201d Caruth said.\n\nIn Nolensville, where the average price for a home is $433,481, Regent has homes from around $258,000 in Burkitt Village.\n\nIn Spring Hill, where the average home costs $296,481, Regent has homes from $162,900 in the Woodside subdivision.\n\nIn many communities, the trend toward smaller yards helps hold down prices. Builders can acquire lots from developers at a lower price and pass the savings on to their customers, Caruth said.\n\nThose large, private yards have been replaced by parks, community green spaces and walking trails in many communities. That appeals to home owners who are looking for a low-maintenance lifestyle.\n\n\u201cBuyers are getting away from one-acre lots. They don\u2019t want their home to be a hindrance,\u201d said Caruth. \u201cThey prefer open spaces, a sense of community.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1IDy608", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "It is possible as builders offer less expensive options in numerous communities.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "It is possible as builders offer less expensive options in numerous communities.", "title": "A new home for less than $400K in Williamson County?", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/williamson/real-estate/2015/01/12/new-home-less-williamson-county/21468437/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It is possible as builders offer less expensive options in numerous communities.", "creator": "@tennessean", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/804dd68c13273c0dbd73cf2019573c9c46ca6533/c=336-0-1665-1329&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/01/08/B9315745681Z.1_20150108185035_001_GT19K9TSM.1-0.jpg", "title": "A new home for less than $400K in Williamson County?", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "news/local/williamson/real-estate", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9716ce6837f4420334c0e27046694c654d729870/c=502-0-1499-1329/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/01/08/B9315745681Z.1_20150108185035_001_GT19K9TSM.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/645938d171f43e743fa9feb214dc63c8c8222c7a/c=336-0-1665-1329/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/01/08/B9315745681Z.1_20150108185035_001_GT19K9TSM.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ae437e761f27793d9ee373950bb274f72b89b412/c=114-0-1886-1329/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/01/08/B9315745681Z.1_20150108185035_001_GT19K9TSM.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e7ec1d73b69522e4f232ac2f2297be5390f06a4f/c=0-102-2000-1227&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/01/08/B9315745681Z.1_20150108185035_001_GT19K9TSM.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-01-11T23:01:32.640000-06:00", "shorthed": "New homes for less than $400K", "articleid": 21468437, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/67c0735e39c74cdd4a918b9936d9b82d0f54d660/c=0-102-2000-1227/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/01/08/B9315745681Z.1_20150108185035_001_GT19K9TSM.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/95a25eeed5786dcf414da6debe7a444ff97cbe71/c=626-0-1374-1329/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/01/08/B9315745681Z.1_20150108185035_001_GT19K9TSM.1-0.jpg"}, "author": "Bill Lewis", "title": "A new home for less than $400K in Williamson County?", "pageclass": "article", "gci-asset-type": "data"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Williamson County real estate, affordable homes Williamson County, real estate franklin TN"}, "article_summary": "There are numerous communities where buyers can find new homes well below Williamson County\u2019s average price, said Jen Lucy, director of sales for the Jones Co.\u201cMost people who work in Williamson County can buy a home in Williamson County,\u201d she said.\nThe average price of a home in Thompson\u2019s Station was $321,682 in November, well below the $475,266 average price in Franklin, according to the Williamson County Association of Realtors.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not sitting right behind another house, and we\u2019ll have Williamson County schools,\u201d said Jackson.\n(Photo: Submitted Photo)In Williamson County, where the average home price topped $455,000 at the end of the year, is it still possible to find an affordable new house?\nIn Nolensville, where the average price for a home is $433,481, Regent has homes from around $258,000 in Burkitt Village."}
