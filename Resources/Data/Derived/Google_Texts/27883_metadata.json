The report also found that the majority of kids living in Cleveland and Buffalo, N.Y. live in poverty, in addition to half of children in Fresno, Calif.; Cincinnati, and Memphis, Tenn. Meanwhile, Newark, N.J.; Miami, St. Louis, and Milwaukee all top the list of some of the poorest cities for children.\n\n\u201cMany Americans \u2014 even policymakers \u2014 seem unaware of the shocking prevalence of child poverty in many of our nation\u2019s most important and iconic cities,\u201d said Curtis Skinner, director of Family Economic Security at the NCCP, in a press release. \u201cReducing child poverty is critical to the social and economic health of cities, now and in the future.\u201d\n\nThe poverty rate for all children in general living in the U.S. in 2013 was 19.9 percent, but the child poverty rate for all large cities in the U.S. is at 30.6 \u2014 a significantly higher percentage that shows big cities are the most affected. Between 2012 and 2013, the national child poverty rate fell by two percentage points; but the big city rate only decreased by one percentage point.\n\nThe researchers found that some factors that have contributed to the growth of poverty in big cities include the loss of manufacturing industries and job losses due to the Great Recession (particularly industrial cities like Detroit and Cleveland). Other cities were affected negatively by the collapse of the housing market and the construction industry, such as Las Vegas and other cities in California and Florida.\n\nAccording to the NCCP, economic hardship and deprivation can have \u201cprofound effects\u201d on a child\u2019s development and future prospects, such as their ability to learn. Poverty can exacerbate behavioral, social, and emotional problems as well, not due to the lack of income, but because of the instability associated with fluctuating incomes.\n\nPoverty can have an impact on child health as well. A 2007 study pointed out that \u201cchildren in families with greater material resources enjoy more secure living conditions and greater access to a range of opportunities that are often unavailable to children from low-income families,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cOn average, children living in low-income families or neighborhoods have poorer health outcomes.\u201d\n\nBecause poverty can affect a child\u2019s health even when they\u2019re adults the authors argue that \u201cthe health sector should provide services to mitigate the health effects of poverty, and articulate the health-related significance of child poverty, in collaboration with other sectors to advance healthy public policy.\u201d\n\nThe researchers at NCCP argue that \u201cpolicymakers at all levels of government need to recognize the pandemic of urban child poverty,\u201d NCCP Director Ren\u00e9e Wilson-Simmons said in the press release. \u201cWe have a tool chest of proven anti-poverty policies, but lack the political will to use them. Because children do better when families do better, it\u2019s essential that two-generation approaches have a central place in the domestic policy agenda. By combining education and training for parents to enable them to move to jobs that offer a path out of poverty with high-quality early care and education for children, the life opportunities of both can be improved.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "nccp, child poverty, children's health", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Most children living in large U.S. cities like Detroit or Cleveland live in poverty, with implications for their future health.", "title": "Poverty Hurts: 30% Of City Kids Are Poor", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/poverty-affects-30-children-us-cities-negatively-affecting-their-health-313360", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/06/socks-holes.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Most children living in large U.S. cities like Detroit or Cleveland live in poverty, with implications for their future health.", "title": "Poverty Hurts: 30% Of City Kids Are Poor", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/poverty-affects-30-children-us-cities-negatively-affecting-their-health-313360", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/06/socks-holes.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/06/socks-holes.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2014-12-06T15:33:59-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-06T19:04:30-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Most children living in large U.S. cities like Detroit or Cleveland live in poverty, with implications for their future health."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9db6\"", "article_summary": "Most children living in large U.S. cities like Detroit or Cleveland live in poverty, with implications for their future health.\nBetween 2012 and 2013, the national child poverty rate fell by two percentage points; but the big city rate only decreased by one percentage point.\nIn a new paper released by the National Center for Children in Poverty (NCCP), a research center at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health, researchers found that many children in large cities in the U.S. are living in poverty.\nMeanwhile, Newark, N.J.; Miami, St. Louis, and Milwaukee all top the list of some of the poorest cities for children.\nPoverty can have an impact on child health as well."}
