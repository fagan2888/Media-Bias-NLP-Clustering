Any documented savings can be shared with the physicians.\"\n\nPrior to any financial gains being realized, quality thresholds that must be met.\n\nThe program includes a two percent episode price cut, according to Lazerow. Medicare is generating savings by pricing the bundle lower than the sum of the individual service payments.\n\nProviders have a year to plan for the cuts.\n\nIn the first year, there is a zero percent discount; the second year, a one percent price cut; and in the third, fourth and fifth years, the two percent price cut goes into effect.\n\nThis poses a real challenge to hospitals and health systems, Lazerow said. Providers will need coordinate more effectively with orthopedic surgeons and post-acute care providers to make episodes more efficient and have a more consistent clinical product.\n\n\"Providers are going to have to collaborate to reduce costs across that episode to offset that price cut,\" he said.\n\nThis program aligns with incentives from other CMS reforms.\n\nIn January, Burwell announced the goal of having 30 percent of Medicare payments tied to alternate payment models by 2016, and 50 percent by 2018.\n\n\"I don't think providers were expecting a mandatory bundled payment program,\" Lazerow said. \"This is the first time Medicare has made an alternative payment model mandatory. It's a big wake up call, for those who hoped the transition to new payment models was not as real as it is.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/what-providers-need-know-about-bundled-payment-mandate", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/bundled-feature.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "In the first year, there is a zero percent discount; the second year, a one percent price cut; and in the third, fourth and fifth years, the two percent price cut goes into effect.<b", "title": "What providers need to know about the bundled payment mandate"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/bundled-feature.jpg"}, "description": "In the first year, there is a zero percent discount; the second year, a one percent price cut; and in the third, fourth and fifth years, the two percent price cut goes into effect.<b", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "What providers need to know about the bundled payment mandate"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Providers in 75 metro markets are now being required to do what was previously voluntary: bundle Medicare payments for hip and knee surgery from the time of the admission until 90 days post-discharge.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd284f\"", "article_summary": "\"I don't think providers were expecting a mandatory bundled payment program,\" Lazerow said.\nProviders will need coordinate more effectively with orthopedic surgeons and post-acute care providers to make episodes more efficient and have a more consistent clinical product.\n\"Providers are going to have to collaborate to reduce costs across that episode to offset that price cut,\" he said.\nThe program includes a two percent episode price cut, according to Lazerow.\nIt's a big wake up call, for those who hoped the transition to new payment models was not as real as it is.\""}
