The bill follows congressional investigations, lawsuits and wrangling over state budget expenditures for drugs such as Sovaldi, a hepatitis C treatment that costs about $1,000 per pill or about $84,000 for a full course of treatment.\n\nChiu makes it clear that his bill does not intend to regulate or moderate prices. \u201cNot at this time,\u201d Chiu said. \u201cWe continue to hear justifications for these sky-high prices for specialty drugs without knowing what the real facts are of what the cost drivers are.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor years, policymakers have been focused on all of the drivers of our extremely expensive health care system,\u201d Chiu said. \u201cEvery aspect of the system has been scrutinized to make sure we have fair and transparent prices. Under the Affordable Care Act, hospitals have been forced to publish a list of prices.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe\u2019ve all seen skyrocketing prices for specialty drugs without knowing why. They\u2019re contributing to the overall cost of health care, threatening the long-term success of the ACA and they\u2019re putting enormous pressure on state budgets.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very appropriate to have a conversation about how these prices are arrived at,\u201d Chiu said.\n\nChiu\u2019s bill would require drugmakers to provide the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development with costs related to several steps of the drugmaking and selling process, including:\n\nAcquisitions;\n\nClinical trials and other regulatory processes;\n\nFinancial assistance offered to patients through various programs;\n\nManufacturing;\n\nMarketing and advertising;\n\nProfits attributed to the drug; and\n\nResearch and development costs paid by the manufacturer or by grants.\n\nOSHPD would post the information online and publish an annual report for the state Legislature.\n\nChiu and members of his staff said there may be similar legislative efforts under way in \u201cfour or five other states,\u201d but they were not aware of any laws requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to divulge pricing information.\n\nSovaldi a Catalyst, but Not the Only One\n\nSovaldi has become a poster child for high-price specialty drugs, but it isn\u2019t the only one. New drugs to treat cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and other diseases could quadruple the cost of specialty drugs in the U.S. from about $87 billion in 2012 to about $350 billion in 2020, according to a report from the UnitedHealth Center for Health Reform & Modernization.\n\n\u201cMy interest in sky-high prices for specialty drugs started around HIV/AIDS drugs,\u201d said Chiu, a former supervisor in San Francisco. \u201cThere were plenty of other drugs that focused attention on this before Sovaldi came along.\u201d\n\nMade by Gilead Sciences in Foster City, Sovaldi has generated at least one lawsuit, a congressional investigation and widespread calls for price reductions.\n\nGilead Sciences did not respond to requests for comment on Chiu\u2019s proposed legislation.\n\nAlthough the cost of treatment is high, the cost of treating hepatitis C patients without Sovaldi or its sibling Harvoni (also high priced \u2014 about $94,000 per course of treatment \u2014 and also made by Gilead) can be higher. Sovaldi has become part of the \u201ccommunity standard\u201d for medical professionals treating patients with hepatitis C, according to California Correctional Health Care Services officials, who oversee clinical care and drug prescriptions for 125,000 inmates at 34 state prisons. They began using Sovaldi last summer.\n\nIn December 2014, PhRMA \u2014 the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America \u2014 released a report claiming hepatitis C has become a curable disease, thanks to new drugs.\n\nWhile acknowledging the importance of medical advancements drugs like Sovaldi represent, Chiu said high prices are \u201ca significant burden on the health care system and ultimately unsustainable in the long-term.\u201d\n\nChiu points out that the $300 million earmarked for hepatitis C treatment in California\u2019s proposed budget for this year could actually be a lot higher. The state Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office questioned whether that amount is appropriate, given the lack of knowledge on the number of hepatitis C patients covered by state programs and the cost per treatment for those patients, Chiu said.\n\n\u201cThese high drug prices are not just straining employers offering health benefits. With one-third of Californians getting public health coverage through Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s financial exposure is significant,\u201d Chiu said in a prepared statement. The statement continued: \u201cIt is incumbent upon lawmakers to ensure that we have a full understanding of the costs impacting these important public programs and find new avenues to achieve savings.\u201d\n\nOpposition Lining Up\n\nFree market proponents, generally opposed to government intrusion in the pursuit of profit, don\u2019t like Chiu\u2019s proposal.\n\nIan Adams \u2014 western region director in the Sacramento office of the R Street Institute, a free-market advocacy organization headquartered in Washington, D.C. \u2014 used characters from the television show \u201cSouth Park\u201d to illustrate his opposition.\n\n\u201cI tend not to be a fan of onerous reporting requirements that lack a clear nexus between exposure and a stated objective,\u201d Adams said in an email. \u201cThis strikes me as just that sort of bill.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIn other words, to borrow from the \u2018underpants gnomes\u2019 from South Park:\n\nStep one: Report on production costs\n\nStep two: ????\n\nStep three: Lower drug costs.\u201d\n\n\u201cCharitably, step two is to \u2018\u2026 offer the public greater insight so that we can identify meaningful strategies to ensure prices do not threaten access to life-saving treatments,'\u201d Adams said, referring to Chiu\u2019s statement accompanying the bill.\n\n\u201cSo, more information will better help the state find ways to lower drug costs?\u201d Adams wrote. \u201cHow?\u201d\n\nAdams said the bill could backfire and actually increase drug costs.\n\n\u201cThis bill is a huge regulatory burden that is predicated on the belief that more information is, by default, better,\u201d Adams said. \u201cWhat policymakers often miss is that information is not free. For every informational request that they make they add to the expense of getting a product to market. In this way, ironically, AB 463 likely works at a cross-purpose with its stated objective,\u201d Adams said.\n\nChiu\u2019s bill will have plenty of opposition, likely led by PhRMA, the trade group representing drugmakers. PhRMA officials did not respond to requests for comment on the bill.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>A bill in the California Legislature calling for drugmakers to explain their high prices for specialty drugs is thought to be the country's first such legislative attempt at pricing transparency. </p>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "A bill in the California Legislature calling for drugmakers to explain their high prices for specialty drugs is thought to be the country\u2019s first such legislative attempt at pricing transpare\u2026", "title": "Drug Transparency Bill May Be First in Nation", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/drug-transparency-bill-may-be-first-in-nation/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/kaiser-californiahealthline/static/images/placeholder.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2015-03-02T03:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-02T03:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cMy interest in sky-high prices for specialty drugs started around HIV/AIDS drugs,\u201d said Chiu, a former supervisor in San Francisco.\n\u201cThese high drug prices are not just straining employers offering health benefits.\nIt is the latest attempt to deal with swiftly rising prices of specialty drugs.\nChiu makes it clear that his bill does not intend to regulate or moderate prices.\nSovaldi a Catalyst, but Not the Only OneSovaldi has become a poster child for high-price specialty drugs, but it isn\u2019t the only one."}
