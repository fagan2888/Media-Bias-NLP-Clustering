It has been shown to raise the \u201cbad,\u201d or LDL, cholesterol in the blood which can lead to cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States.\n\nThe department gave food manufacturers three years to remove the partially hydrogenated oils or PHOs from their products. The companies can also petition the FDA for a special permit to use it. No PHOs can be added to human food unless otherwise approved by the FDA.\n\n\u201cThe FDA\u2019s action on this major source of artificial trans fat demonstrates the agency\u2019s commitment to the heart health of all Americans,\u201d said Dr. Stephen Ostroff, the agency\u2019s acting commissioner, in a news release. \u201cThis action is expected to reduce coronary heart disease and prevent thousands of fatal heart attacks every year.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, the FDA had made a tentative determination that trans fats were no longer safe, after years of public comment and scientific review this is the final step in the process.\n\nManufacturers have had to list trans fat content on their labels since 2006, and there has been a significant decrease in the amount of trans fat in American foods.\n\nThe FDA estimates trans fat consumption declined about 78% between 2003 and 2012 after the labeling went into effect. That\u2019s when many companies reduced trans fat content from their products, or at least some of it. The law still allowed companies to list products as \u201ctrans fat free\u201d even if they had 0.5 grams of fat.\n\nIn 2007, New York City adopted a regulation that banned it from restaurants, but some restaurants were already ahead of the legal changes.\n\nCompanies like McDonald\u2019s had stopped cooking their french fries in trans fat more than a decade ago. Their online menus say all their fried food is free of trans fat. Chick-fil-A removed all artificial trans fat from its menu in 2008.\n\nBefore it became a popular ingredient in processed and fast foods, trans fat was introduced into the American diet as early as 1911 in the form of shortening or hydrogenated vegetable oil, used for cooking and making pies.\n\nPartially hydrogenated oil is formed when hydrogen is added to liquid oils to make solid fats, like shortening and margarine. It also increases the shelf life of food and enhances flavors.\n\nAmerican dietary guidelines recommended Americans keep their trans fat consumption \u201cas low as possible.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Artificial trans fat will have to disappear from the American diet, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
