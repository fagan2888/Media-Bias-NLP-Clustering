Roughly 5 percent of Department of Health positions would be eliminated under Gov. Rick Scottâ€™s latest budget proposal, the Tampa Bay Times reports.

County health department nutritionists, health counselors and family support workers are among the 758 positions being cut. A DOH spokeswoman told the Times more than 500 of those spots are vacant. The 200 layoffs involve administrative positions, the Times reports.
