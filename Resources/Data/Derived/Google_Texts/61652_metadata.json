Researchers also analyzed X-Rays, autopsies, hospital records, photographs and social media posts.\n\nThe report \u201cprovides compelling evidence of frequent and widespread prisoner abuse by a broad range of captors on both sides of the conflict,\u201d according to a press release on Amnesty International\u2019s website.\n\nThe report\u2019s release comes days after the pro-Ukraine Aydar Battalion captured two Russian special forces soldiers during a firefight in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine\u2019s treatment of the two captured Russian soldiers, who were both wounded and required medical treatment, earned praise from U.S. officials, including U.S. Army Europe Commander Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, who said he was \u201cimpressed\u201d by Ukraine\u2019s handling of the prisoners.\n\nCritics, however, have suggested Kyiv committed a war crime by displaying the captured Russians to the media.\n\nOf the 33 former prisoners interviewed in Amnesty International\u2019s report, 17 were held by separatists and 16 by pro-Ukraine military and law enforcement units, including the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU).\n\nThe former prisoners described being beaten until their bones broke, tortured by electric shock, stabbed, hung from the ceiling, deprived of sleep for days, threatened with death, denied urgent medical care and subjected to mock executions.\n\n\u201cThese are war crimes,\u201d said Denis Krivosheev, Europe and Central Asia Programme deputy director at Amnesty International, speaking to journalists in Kyiv on Friday. \u201cTorture takes place very often and is used by both sides of the conflict.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the shadow of eastern Ukraine\u2019s still smoldering conflict, our on-the-ground research shows that accounts of detainee torture are as commonplace as they are shocking,\u201d John Dalhuisen, director of the Europe and Central Asia Programme at Amnesty International, said in a statement.\n\nUnits on both sides of the conflict disputed the report.\n\nThe Security Service of Ukraine announced Friday that it would meet with Amnesty International to discuss the report. The Associated Press reported Friday that separatist spokesman Eduard Basurin dismissed the report, citing a lack of evidence. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhile Amnesty International accused both sides of prisoner abuse, allegations against pro-Ukraine fighters largely focused on Right Sector, a nationalist political party and paramilitary group that originated from the Euromaidan protests in 2013 and has played a key role in many battles for the pro-Ukrainian forces.\n\n\u201cUsing an abandoned youth camp as an ad hoc prison, Right Sector has reportedly held dozens of civilian prisoners as hostages, brutally torturing them and extorting large amounts of money from them and their families,\u201d according to Amnesty International.\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Signal, Right Sector press officer Artem Skoropadskiy pushed back against Amnesty\u2019s claims.\n\n\u201cWe are neither torturing nor beating civilians,\u201d he said. \u201cThere might be some injuries done during capturing, but not after they ended up in captivity. We forward all prisoners to the SBU. Mostly we are capturing civilians from around Peski, who are saboteurs, gun layers, spotters.\u201d\n\nResponding to the accusation that Right Sector was holding separatist fighters for ransom, Skoropadskiy said: \u201cAs to the blame of money extortion, that sounds funny, since most of the civilians do not have money, thus they start working for Russia for small amounts.\u201d\n\nAmnesty International\u2019s allegations against the pro-Russian separatists were more wide-ranging, including summary executions of prisoners, according to eyewitness testimonies and media reports.\n\n\u201cAmnesty has also identified at least three recent incidents where separatist fighters summarily killed at least eight pro-Kiev fighters,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201c[\u2026] In an interview with a journalist, one separatist armed group leader openly admitted to killing captive Ukrainian soldiers, which is a war crime.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first allegation of human rights violations in the Ukraine conflict. In August 2014, Human Rights Watch said pro-Russian separatists were detaining and torturing civilians, and subjecting them to forced labor.\n\n\u201cPro-Russian insurgents are regularly committing horrendous crimes,\u201d said Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThere are solid grounds to be seriously concerned about the safety and well-being of anyone held by insurgent forces in eastern Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe fact that the separatist breakaway republics\u2014the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic (DNR) and Luhansk People\u2019s Republic (LNR)\u2014 are not internationally recognized states does not relieve them of their responsibilities to treat prisoners of war ethically, Krivosheev said.\n\n\u201cThe DNR and LNR are also responsible, according to international law, although they are not a recognized state \u2026 they are responsible to avert torture,\u201d Krivosheev said. \u201cAnd people who do this should be immediately relieved of their positions. They should send a clear cut message that such behavior is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nPrisoner exchanges have become a moneymaking venture for separatist forces, according to families of released Ukrainian soldiers who report having paid ransoms. Civilian volunteer organizations have been created to help facilitate ransom payments and communication between the families of captured Ukrainian soldiers and their separatist captors.\n\n\u201cIt was all pretty simple,\u201d said the brother-in-law of an Azov Regiment soldier who was released from captivity. He spoke on condition of anonymity due to security concerns. \u201cThey called us, said what we had to pay, and gave us the wire transfer instructions. As soon as the money was sent they let him go. It was all very matter of fact.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe official exchange process has stopped,\u201d Krivosheev said. \u201cThere is not one single body responsible for the exchange of prisoners. There are three separate entities on the Ukrainian side; one is a volunteer group dedicated to prisoner exchanges. It\u2019s more chaotic on the separatist side.\u201d\n\nAmnesty International pushed the UN to launch an investigation, but put the onus on Kyiv to do more to crack down on war crimes and prisoner abuse, calling on the government to launch investigations into violations on both sides.\n\n\u201cThe Ukrainian authorities must investigate all allegations of war crimes and other abuses, open files and collect evidence of abuses by separatist forces and bring to justice all those responsible for perpetrating such heinous acts,\u201d Dalhuisen said in a statement.\n\nThe report also dispelled some unfounded rumors of prisoner abuse, including a video allegedly showing members of the Ukrainian National Guard Azov Regiment burning alive a captured separatist.\n\n\u201cA video allegedly showing a separatist being burned alive by a Ukrainian volunteer battalion was not confirmed,\u201d said Krassimir Yankov, a researcher at Amnesty International Ukraine. \u201cThis is an information war. There are a lot of rumors of horrors on both sides of the front.\u201d\n\nThe ongoing U.S. training of the Ukrainian National Guard as part of exercise Fearless Guardian includes a course in the Geneva Conventions and the ethical treatment of prisoners.\n\nWhile the accounts of torture and abuse amounted to what Amnesty International called, \u201cserious war crimes,\u201d the scale of the problem has not yet matched that of other recent conflicts in which human rights abuses were rampant.\n\n\u201cThis conflict is nowhere near Yugoslavia,\u201d Krivosheev said.\n\nYankov said the sample size of 33 former prisoners was sufficient to make a sweeping analysis of human rights violations throughout the conflict, but he admitted interviews with former prisoners could be flawed due to the psychological trauma of detention and abuse and the resultant distortion of memories.\n\n\u201cThe testimony of people who were tortured is not always reliable,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Ukrainian media reports, which have not be independently verified, combined Russian-separatist forces may be holding as many as 400 to 700 Ukrainian soldiers prisoner.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Both sides in the Ukraine conflict are guilty of prisoner abuse, says an Amnesty International report.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Both sides in the Ukraine conflict are guilty of prisoner abuse, says an Amnesty International report.", "title": "Report: Widespread Prisoner Abuse, Torture in Ukraine Conflict", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/WarCrimesFeat.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1cbRvvJ"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Both sides in the Ukraine conflict are guilty of prisoner abuse, says an Amnesty International report.", "title": "Report: Widespread Prisoner Abuse, Torture in Ukraine Conflict", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/WarCrimesFeat.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Featured Topics", "tag": "europe", "published_time": "2015-05-23T17:26:27+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ukraine, cease-fire, Russia, Putin, NATO, prisoners, abuse, Amnesty International, POW"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe21a3\"", "article_summary": "The Security Service of Ukraine announced Friday that it would meet with Amnesty International to discuss the report.\nThe report \u201cprovides compelling evidence of frequent and widespread prisoner abuse by a broad range of captors on both sides of the conflict,\u201d according to a press release on Amnesty International\u2019s website.\n\u201cA video allegedly showing a separatist being burned alive by a Ukrainian volunteer battalion was not confirmed,\u201d said Krassimir Yankov, a researcher at Amnesty International Ukraine.\n\u201cThese are war crimes,\u201d said Denis Krivosheev, Europe and Central Asia Programme deputy director at Amnesty International, speaking to journalists in Kyiv on Friday.\nThe report\u2019s release comes days after the pro-Ukraine Aydar Battalion captured two Russian special forces soldiers during a firefight in eastern Ukraine."}
