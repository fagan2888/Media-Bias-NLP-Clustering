CANTON, Ohio

CANTON, Ohio (AP) - Backup quarterback Mike Kafka threw a touchdown pass and running back Joe Banyard ran for another score to help the Minnesota Vikings beat the Pittsburgh Steelers 14-3 on Sunday night in the Hall of Fame game.



Most of the regulars watched from the sidelines in the annual exhibition opener, including Adrian Peterson and Ben Roethlisberger.



Minnesota quarterback Teddy Bridgewater completed 5 of 6 passes for 44 yards in his one series of work. The reigning Rookie of the Year's night ended when the Steelers stopped the Vikings on fourth down midway through the first quarter.



There was a moment of silence before kickoff for Hall of Fame running back and longtime broadcaster Frank Gifford. The former New York Giants star died Sunday morning at age 84.
