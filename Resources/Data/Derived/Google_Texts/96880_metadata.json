The smiling Indian caricature, deemed racist by many, will remain on the caps and jersey sleeves of its home uniform.\n\nAlthough there\u2019s been no official statement from the organization, the trend toward de-emphasizing Wahoo is continuing. The logo on the caps has changed, the team reduced the logo\u2019s visibility at spring training, and they don\u2019t promote the Chief like they did during past publicity events.\n\nThe New Republic reports that Curtis Danberg, the Indians\u2019 senior director of communications, said that there is not any sudden move to ditch the chief and that their decision to phase out the logo is unrelated to anything in the news, in other words the \u201cRedskins\u201d debate. \u201cThere is no conspiracy theory,\u201d Danberg said.\n\nA few months ago, the team surveyed their fans\u2019 feelings about the logo. It was an effort, at least it appeared to be, to make a break toward sensitivity. At the time the team facilitated the survey, they said they had discussions with people of all races and understood that not everyone was keen on \u201cChief Wahoo.\u201d\n\nRELATED Cleveland Indians Do Self-Serving Survey About \u201cChief Wahoo\u201d\n\nSportslogs.net has been chronicling the changes since 2009. That year, they replaced Wahoo with a red C on batting helmets; in 2013, the team started wearing those batting helmets during home games. After winning a wildcard spot in the playoffs last year, there was no trace of the smiling logo on apparel, and perhaps most telling, in an official MLB graphic with all 30 teams displayed, the Indians were the only team not to use their primary logo, according to the New Republic.\n\nTravis Waldron, of Think Progress pointed out that the Indians \u201cmay give up the logo on the web site and on road uniforms and spring training outfits, but they\u2019re still going to use it at home, where they can hide behind the preferences of their fans.\u201d He said that the Indians are more receptive of change than the \u201cRedskins,\u201d for example, but they\u2019re in a pseudo tug-of war, balancing how to please their fans, with avoiding galloping into a PR nightmare.\n\nRegardless, the Cleveland Indians have made a change. Now let\u2019s see if the Washington football team follows suit.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Indians Logo Phase out Begins", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/01/09/cleveland-indians-slowly-phasing-out-chief-wahoo-153037", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/indians_logo.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Cleveland Indians Slowly Phasing out Chief Wahoo"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-01-09T13:32-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/01/09/cleveland-indians-slowly-phasing-out-chief-wahoo-153037", "dc": {"title": "Cleveland Indians Slowly Phasing out Chief Wahoo"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Cleveland Indians Slowly Phasing out Chief Wahoo"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd11f6\"", "article_summary": "The Cleveland Indians have slowly phased out its Chief Wahoo logo in favor of that big C, but the team hasn\u2019t eliminated the Chief completely.\nRegardless, the Cleveland Indians have made a change.\nAt the time the team facilitated the survey, they said they had discussions with people of all races and understood that not everyone was keen on \u201cChief Wahoo.\u201dRELATED Cleveland Indians Do Self-Serving Survey About \u201cChief Wahoo\u201dSportslogs.net has been chronicling the changes since 2009.\nThat year, they replaced Wahoo with a red C on batting helmets; in 2013, the team started wearing those batting helmets during home games.\nAlthough there\u2019s been no official statement from the organization, the trend toward de-emphasizing Wahoo is continuing."}
