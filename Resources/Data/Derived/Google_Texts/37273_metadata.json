The reorganization, completed last October, put a new focus on digital and cybersecurity efforts.\n\nAfter withdrawing its contentious proposal, the CIA needs to come up with a new plan for how to preserve or destroy officials' email records. That plan will have to be presented to the National Archives.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The proposal was condemned by lawmakers in both parties.", "description": "The proposal was condemned by lawmakers in both parties.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julian Hattem", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The proposal was condemned by lawmakers in both parties.", "title": "CIA withdraws plan to destroy emails", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/275076-cia-withdraws-plan-to-destroy-emails", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/cia_030305getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-04T12:06:16-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-04-04T12:06-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/275076-cia-withdraws-plan-to-destroy-emails", "dcterms.date": "2016-04-04T11:50-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Julian Hattem", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Central Intelligence Agency, National Archives and Records Administration,,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-04T11:50:56-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-04T12:06:16-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/275076-cia-withdraws-plan-to-destroy-emails", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The proposal was condemned by lawmakers in both parties.", "card": "summary", "title": "CIA withdraws plan to destroy emails"}, "dcterms.title": "CIA withdraws plan to destroy emails"}, "article_summary": "The CIA has formally withdrawn a controversial proposal to destroy the emails of all but 22 top-level officials after an employee leaves office.\nAfter withdrawing its contentious proposal, the CIA needs to come up with a new plan for how to preserve or destroy officials' email records.\nThe National Archives said it would \u201creassess\u201d the proposal following the congressional outrage, and it remained under review until the CIA formally killed it.\nThat plan will have to be presented to the National Archives.\nA representative for the National Archives confirmed to The Hill on Monday that the agency backtracked on its proposal last month, following efforts to reorganize its structure."}
