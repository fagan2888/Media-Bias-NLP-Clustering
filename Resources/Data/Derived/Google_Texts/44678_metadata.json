About 30 people attended the hearing, which is part of the department\u2019s review of Highmark\u2019s proposal to acquire Wilkes-Barre-based Blue Cross of NEPA.\n\nIf approved, the acquisition would push Highmark\u2019s membership to about 5 million across 62 of the state\u2019s 67 counties.\n\n\u201cFrom BC NEPA\u2019s perspective, with challenges on the cost side, they would have to ... close the operating loss primarily through sharp premium increases,\u201d Capps said.\n\nDespite carrying a surplus of about $348 million, Blue Cross of NEPA\u2019s long-term sustainability is threatened by industry changes and market shifts, a 2011 independent review found.\n\nBased on rising medical care costs and Affordable Care Act requirements, among other factors, the company projects negative operating returns in the coming years, President and CEO Denise Cesare said.\n\nA consultant recommended Blue Cross of NEPA seek a partner to provide between $40 and $150 million in capital support and help expand its footprint beyond the 13-county service area in order for the insurer to remain viable in the long-term.\n\n\u201cMerging with Highmark, a much larger company with significant capital and enhanced capabilities, provides the resources needed to offer a wider array of products and services for consumers, develop programs and tools to support the transformation to accountable care ... and make available significant IT investment,\u201d Cesare said.\n\nUnder the proposal, which Highmark submitted to the state Insurance Department in February, Highmark commits to \u201csubstantial continued employment\u201d in the region for at least four years. Blue Cross of NEPA has about 750 employees.\n\nState Insurance Commissioner Michael Consedine said regulators evaluate a number of factors, including the competitive impact and the affect on policyholders.\n\nHe said there is no timeline for a decision.\n\n\u201cThe hearing really starts the process of winding us to a conclusion,\u201d Consedine said. \u201cSo the next step will be to leave this public comment period open for an extended amount of time. We will also get very in-depth reports from our outside experts, which will talk about the competitive and financial aspects of the deal.\u201d\n\nTo comment, email cbybee@pa.gov.\n\nmiorfino@timesshamrock.com, @miorfinoTT", "article_metadata": {"author": "By Michael Iorfino", "title": "Blue Cross of NEPA, Highmark merger could lower premiums", "robots": "ACAP allow-index", "DC.creator": "By Michael Iorfino", "tout": {"article": {"id": "1.1787330"}}, "keywords": "Local", "DC.subject": "Local", "DC.title": "Blue Cross of NEPA, Highmark merger could lower premiums"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb68e\"", "article_summary": "Blue Cross of NEPA has about 750 employees.\nAbout 30 people attended the hearing, which is part of the department\u2019s review of Highmark\u2019s proposal to acquire Wilkes-Barre-based Blue Cross of NEPA.\nDespite carrying a surplus of about $348 million, Blue Cross of NEPA\u2019s long-term sustainability is threatened by industry changes and market shifts, a 2011 independent review found.\nBlue Cross of Northeastern Pennsylvania members likely will see lower premium increases and improved quality of care if the insurer joins health insurance giant Highmark Inc., an economist who analyzed the proposal said Wednesday.\nUnder the proposal, which Highmark submitted to the state Insurance Department in February, Highmark commits to \u201csubstantial continued employment\u201d in the region for at least four years."}
