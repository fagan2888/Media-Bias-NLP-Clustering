Bills targeting the ride-share service Uber, and the room share system Air B&B are moving. Craft Brewers are challenging major distributors for dominance and now some doctors are getting in the disruptive spirit by kicking traditional health insurance to the curb.\n\n\n\nPrimary care is considered the front-line of medicine. The idea is simple. Treat people before they get sick, keep them healthy, and out of emergency rooms. But the number of primary care doctors is shrinking. They make less than specialists and carry a greater workload. And according to a Kaiser Health News survey, the state needs more than 900 primary care doctors to meet current demands. And Dr. Garrison Bliss says primary care doctors are stressed.\n\n\"If you take a look as a medical student at your options, one of the things you\u2019ll discover is you can go into a number of specialties, and do very exotic and sexy work,\" he told the House Health Innovation Committee back in February. \"Or you can come into primary care, see 25-30 people a day, and at the end of the day go home and put your head on ice, and get paid a third as much as everybody else.\u201d\n\nBliss, a Seattle-based physician was talking about a concept he now uses in his practice--direct primary care. The idea behind it goes like this. A person plays a flat monthly fee, and gets to see the doctor when he or she needs to. It eliminates the insurance company\u2014and also gets rid of payments based on items like tests, labs and procedures. So far, Bliss says it\u2019s working out well for him.\n\n\u201cWe get paid once a month, and that\u2019s all we get paid. We don\u2019t need money from anyone else. We don\u2019t have to make our money by doing things to patients. We don\u2019t have to come up with exorbitant diagnosis and treatments in order to facilitate our work. We can work with a healthy person who wants to stay healthy, and get paid. And it\u2019s a pretty interesting way of doing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDirect primary care is a disruptive innovation that breaks the mold,\" said National Federation of Independent Business-Florida's Tim Nungesser.\n\nHe and other supporters say direct primary care challenges traditional health insurance, where doctors are paid a fee for services rendered. Direct Primary Care also results in more money for the doctor, because the middle man\u2014the insurance company, is out of the picture. Businesses like the concept because they see it as a cost savings. Nungesser notes a key caveat\u2014direct patient care does NOT replace the need for insurance, but can work with it.\n\n\u201cA direct primary care, coupled with a major medical policy, satisfied the employer mandate for ObamaCare,\" he testified before a recent Senate panel considering the issue.\n\nThe legislation makes clear direct primary care is not insurance\u2014both for patient disclosure purposes, and for state regulatory clarity. The House and Senate bills are nearly identical, and both include an unrelated effort to market Florida as a destination for Medical tourism. That\u2019s supported by Patty Holland, who represents the Medical Tourism Association.\n\n\u201cMedical tourism is five to tens times tourism alone. So the economic impact is greater.\u201d\n\nPlans to fund marketing efforts promoting medical tourism had been languishing, but are getting a boost due to their attachment to the direct primary care proposal.\n\nThe combined proposal is generating bipartisan support as they move through the legislative process.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "It\u2019s a year of disruption in Florida.
