A rare December tornado touched down around 5:20 Sunday evening five miles northeast of Harper.

There have been no reported damage or injuries, but several people who saw the tornado were surprised it happened this late in the year.

Kevin Kunz and his kids came outside to take a look at the storm clouds just after sunset when they saw their first tornado.

"You could definitely tell it was still spinning, you didn't see any debris being thrown up in the air which it usually common," said Kunz.

Photos sent in by viewers show the tornado from a distance. Dark clouds covered the sky and the tornado was clearly on the ground.

Sheila Drouhard was driving home when she saw it only a mile away.

"It was just like a wet dirt-devil, but you knew it was heavy because you knew it was moist out," said Drouhard. "It was raining, rain drops were hitting the windshield. It was scary."

December tornadoes are pretty rare in Kansas, but not unheard of. There have been 6 reported since records started being kept 58 years ago. Some people in Harper County didn't think tornadoes were possible in December.

"It was very surprising," said Drouhard.

"We usually see it during the summer months around here," Kunz said. "It's pretty common around this area, but yeah it was a pretty good size."

The last reported December tornado in the state was twelve years ago in southeast Kansas.
