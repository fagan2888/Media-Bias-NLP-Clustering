(Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP)\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court has spoken: Obamacare will survive, and same-sex marriage is the law of the land.\n\nHas the court under the leadership of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. lost its ideological marbles and, gasp, turned liberal? That\u2019s the billion-dollar question observers of the high tribunal are asking in the wake of the tumultuous October 2014 term.\n\nThe answer, though complicated, is that the court\u2019s drift to the left has been exaggerated by cheerleaders on both ends of the mainstream political spectrum. Here are five takeaways from the current term to help explain why:\n\nAdvertisement Square, Site wide\n\n1. John Roberts is no David Souter, much less Earl Warren.\n\nAccording to a detailed report published June 23 by The New York Times, two days before the ruling (King v. Burwell) on Obamacare was announced, the court was on track to conclude its most liberal term since the heydays of the Warren Court in the 1950s and \u201960s. The Times\u2019 article was based on the findings of the Supreme Court Database, an analytics-based research project that uses criteria developed by political scientists to evaluate and code the court\u2019s decisions.\n\nWith the release of Roberts\u2019 majority opinion in King and the opinion on same-sex marriage the next day, alarm bells were sounding on the American right, with the chief justice bearing the brunt of the opprobrium.\n\n\u201cRoberts = Souter,\u201d tweeted campaign consultant Matt Mackowiak, founder of the ultra-right Potomac Strategy Group, referring to former Supreme Court Justice David Souter, a Republican appointee who compiled a surprisingly moderate record during his tenure on the bench.\n\nRoberts \u201cis now just the water boy for the welfare state,\u201d tweeted the unremittingly hysterical Fox News host Andrea Tantaros, ratcheting up the heat another notch.\n\nExtending the metaphorical social-media lynching of Roberts still further, Fox Business Network anchor Charles Payne bloviated in his tweet of the day that the King ruling was \u201canother giant step toward Banana Republic.\u201d Although unspecified, Payne clearly had in mind the form of government at one time prevalent in Latin America, not the retail clothing chain.\n\nAnd not to be outdone, Presidential candidate Ted Cruz\u2014the Texas senator whom I have sometimes compared in my own Twitter account to the late Sen. Joseph McCarthy, R-Wis., in both physical appearance and vitriolic rhetoric\u2014called for a constitutional amendment that would subject Supreme Court justices to periodic judicial-retention elections in order to \u201crestore the rule of law.\u201d\n\nThe reality, of course, is that Roberts is neither the second coming of David Souter nor, even more so, Earl Warren. With few exceptions\u2014notably, the King decision and last year\u2019s unanimous ruling in Riley v. California that shielded arrestees from warrantless searches of their cellphones\u2014Roberts is what he has always been: a reliable conservative who nearly always votes in line with his backward-looking brethren Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. In fact, according to the statistics compiled by Scotusblog.com, Roberts voted in agreement with Scalia during the current term at an 83 percent clip, higher than his agreement rate with any other member of the panel.\n\nAny question as to Roberts\u2019 right-wing bona fides were laid to rest June 26 with his dissenting opinion in the court\u2019s landmark 5-4 ruling on gay marriage, Obergefell v. Hodges. Penning a dissent, Roberts channeled his own version of Ted Cruz, condemning the Obergefell majority\u2019s endorsement of same-sex marriage as an outrageous form of judicial activism, arguing:\n\n\u201cAs a result [of the majority ruling], the Court invalidates the marriage laws of more than half the States and orders the transformation of a social institution that has formed the basis of human society for millennia, for the Kalahari Bushmen and the Han Chinese, the Carthaginians and the Aztecs. Just who do we think we are?\u201d\n\nComing from the justice who just two years earlier had produced the majority opinion in Shelby County v. Holder that gutted the Voting Rights Act, such words rang hollow and hypocritical.\n\nTrue to his usual form, on June 29, the last decision day of the current term, Roberts concurred in two conservative 5-4 opinions: a death-penalty ruling (Glossip v. Gross) written by Alito that upheld Oklahoma\u2019s lethal injection procedure; and an environmental opinion (Michigan v. EPA) by Scalia that overturned restrictions placed on the emission of hazardous pollutants from coal-based power plants.\n\nRoberts also voted in the minority on the last day in a liberal 5-4 decision written by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg (Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission) that upheld the creation of a redistricting agency in Arizona.\n\nIn the future, there is no reason not to expect more of the same from the chief.\n\n2. Justice Anthony Kennedy remains the court\u2019s swing vote, but he is at best a moderate.\n\nLong recognized as the court\u2019s pivotal member in close high-profile cases, Kennedy wrote the majority opinion in Obergefell. Earning well-deserved praise for his opinion not just from the LGBT community but broadly from all those who believe the Constitution was designed to protect an evolving rather than fixed set of social values, Kennedy wrote that couples seeking to wed have a fundamental right to \u201cequal dignity in the eyes of the law\u201d that only marriage can bestow.\n\nAs historic as the Obergefell ruling is, however, it is also modest from a technical legal standpoint. In particular, Kennedy stopped short of holding that sexual orientation generally\u2014like race, national origin or religious affiliation\u2014is what is termed in constitutional law a \u201csuspect classification\u201d entitled the highest degree of judicial protection. To withstand court challenges, laws and governmental practices that discriminate against people who fall within such classifications must pass an exacting \u201cheightened scrutiny\u201d test, under which it must be shown that the laws and practices under review not only further a \u201ccompelling state interest\u201d but that they are narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.\n\nWriting in The Guardian last Friday, columnist Scott Lemieux contended that: \u201cThe refusal to define sexual orientation as subject to heightened scrutiny will lead to unnecessary confusion, and possibly permit federal and state judges to deny LBGT rights claims [in other contexts] that even Kennedy might think should be upheld.\u201d\n\nAs Lemieux notes, \u201cLGBT people face many other types of discrimination\u2014in public accommodations and in employment, for example\u2014that now may have to be fought out case by never-ending case in the lower courts.\u201d Although federal civil rights statutes dealing with accommodations and employment do not specifically refer to sexual orientation, a pronouncement from the Supreme Court conferring suspect classification status on sexual orientation would greatly assist those future legal struggles.\n\nKennedy\u2019s moderate and cautious stance was also evident in last week\u2019s other 5-4 liberal triumph on discrimination under the federal Fair Housing Act. Writing again for the majority, Kennedy held that claims of housing and mortgage-lending discrimination could be based on a showing that established policies had an adverse disparate impact on minorities and that discriminatory intent need not be shown. The court majority nonetheless placed new procedural limits on when and how disparate-impact claims may be brought.\n\nIt should also be remembered that Kennedy\u2019s penchant for swinging goes both ways. In 2010, Kennedy crafted the majority opinion in Citizens United. And in 2012, he wrote another important 5-4 majority conservative opinion (Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders) upholding routine strip searches of all persons detained and admitted to general jail populations, even those arrested on minor traffic violations who are not suspected of harboring contraband.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "affordable care act, anthony kennedy, bernie sanders, bill blum, chief justice john g. roberts, clarence thomas, gay marriage, gop, hillary clinton, jeb bush, lgbt, obama, obamacare, republicans, scalia, scotus, sotomayor, supreme court, ted cruz", "og": {"site_name": "Truthdig", "description": "The end of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s term has brought some big surprises for sure, but should either end of the political/social spectrum get excited about what the major decisions might mean?\n - 2015/06/29", "title": "SCOTUS Wraps Up: 5 Takeaways From the Supreme Court\u2019s Current Term: Bill Blum", "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/scotus_wrapup_5_takeaways_from_the_supreme_courts_current_term_20150629", "image": {"width": 361, "identifier": "http://www.truthdig.com/images/reportuploads/supreme_court_ap_360.jpg", "height": 254}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The end of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s term has brought some big surprises for sure, but should either end of the political/social spectrum get excited about what the major decisions might mean?", "title": "SCOTUS Wraps Up: 5 Takeaways From the Supreme Court\u2019s Current Term | Truthdig: Drilling Beneath the Headlines", "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/scotus_wrapup_5_takeaways_from_the_supreme_courts_current_term_20150629/", "image": {"width": 361, "identifier": "http://www.truthdig.com/images/reportuploads/supreme_court_ap_360.jpg", "height": 254}, "creator": "@truthdig", "site": "@truthdig"}, "fb": {"app_id": 319814091404244}, "keywords": "Truthdig, SCOTUS Wraps Up: 5 Takeaways From the Supreme Court\u2019s Current Term, affordable care act, anthony kennedy, bernie sanders, bill blum, chief justice john g. roberts, clarence thomas, gay marriage, gop, hillary clinton, jeb bush, lgbt, obama, obamacare, republicans, scalia, scotus, sotomayor, supreme court, ted cruz", "article": {"tag": "affordable care act, anthony kennedy, bernie sanders, bill blum, chief justice john g. roberts, clarence thomas, gay marriage, gop, hillary clinton, jeb bush, lgbt, obama, obamacare, republicans, scalia, scotus, sotomayor, supreme court, ted cruz", "published_time": "2015-06-29T11:26:43-08:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T14:57:44-08:00"}, "description": "The end of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s term has brought some big surprises for sure, but should either end of the political/social spectrum get excited about what the major decisions might mean?\n - 2015/06/29"}, "article_summary": "By Bill BlumThe justices pose for a group photo at the Supreme Court in Washington.\n(Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP)The Supreme Court has spoken: Obamacare will survive, and same-sex marriage is the law of the land.\nThe court majority nonetheless placed new procedural limits on when and how disparate-impact claims may be brought.\nLong recognized as the court\u2019s pivotal member in close high-profile cases, Kennedy wrote the majority opinion in Obergefell.\nThe Times\u2019 article was based on the findings of the Supreme Court Database, an analytics-based research project that uses criteria developed by political scientists to evaluate and code the court\u2019s decisions."}
