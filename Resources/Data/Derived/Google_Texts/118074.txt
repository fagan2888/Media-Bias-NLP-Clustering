President Obama’s failure to consider the optics of his actions after an Islamic State execution of a U.S. citizen has become a point of criticism again.

Face the Nation host Bob Schieffer expressed his displeasure with the president for not appearing to show strength after the Islamic State execution of Kayla Mueller. Schieffer grieved that just hours after another American hostage was confirmed killed under the captivity of the Islamic State, the president shot a lighthearted video with BuzzFeed then headed out west for a fundraiser charging $10,000 per plate.

“Here is the part that bothers me … after that Jordanian pilot was killed in that horrible way, here you saw the king put on his fatigues, he executes two prisoners that they were holding in Jordan and launched bombing raids,” Schieffer said.

“We have another American hostage killed and Congress and the president goes off to California to do a fundraiser and some other stuff and the Congress goes on vacation and they say, yeah, we will debate what to do about all of this, but we are going to do it as long as it fits into the schedule. There is no reason to do anything out of the ordinary,” Schieffer continued.

The president apologized for golfing just minutes after condemning the beheading of James Foley.
