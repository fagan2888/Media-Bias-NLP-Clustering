Johnson & Johnson announced Friday that the company is recalling 200,000 bottles of its most popular Motrin Infants formula — Motrin Infants Drops Original Berry Flavor — due to a risk that they may contain tiny plastic particles. Consumers have been asked to stop using the impacted items and call the company for a refund at 1-877-414-7709.

"From our perspective, during the manufacturing process at the third party supplier, that's when the particles got into the ibuprofen," McNeil Vice President Ed Kuffner told the Associated Press.

According to information obtained by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), tiny plastic particles (about the size of a poppy seed) were identified in a product lot before it was released to the market. The particles originated with a third party supplier of ibuprofen, which is the active ingredient in the Motrin infant drops. The company is taking every precaution to ensure that any lots that entered the market prior to the discovery of the plastic particles be recalled due to “the potential for adverse medical events.” However, the company does reiterate that the likelihood of a baby getting sick is very low. The recall is a voluntary, cautionary measure.

Half-ounce bottles of Motrin Infants Drops Original Berry Flavor are the subject of the recall. They can be identified by their lot numbers: DCB3T01, DDB4R01 and DDB4S01.
