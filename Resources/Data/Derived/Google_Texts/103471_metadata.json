It\u2019s so done, in fact, that Senate Republicans may not even bother to bring a resolution of disapproval up for a vote, as it wouldn\u2019t have the necessary votes to overcome a Democratic filibuster.\n\nBut Republican Congressman Louie Gohmert (R \u2013 Jade Helmistan) isn\u2019t giving up hope. He remains committed to standing in the way of President Obama\u2019s, in his words, \u201cdrastic move towards a nuclear holocaust\u201d that he is willing to stake his tenure in Congress on the matter, reportedly promising Glenn Beck in an email that he would quit if the deal eventually does take effect.\n\nSaid Beck:\n\nI just got an email from Louie Gohmert. He said, last week I announced to the world if the House and Senate will treat Iran \u2014 the Iran treaty as a treaty, I will not run for my congressional seat again. It\u2019s the only thing that I have left that our leadership wants beside my integrity. And after last week that I spent in Egypt, I feel so compelled to do absolutely everything I can to derail this president\u2019s drastic move towards a nuclear holocaust. I won\u2019t run again if the House voted on my attached resolution and the Senate voted on ratification.\n\nBye, Felicia!\n\nGohmert, a self-described man of integrity and principle, will no doubt gracefully step aside when the time comes \u2014 that time being very, very soon. And he will presumably return to Texas, dig a very deep hole, and stay there until after the coming nuclear holocaust \u2014 that time being not so soon, to say the least.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting here is that, for all of the hand-wringing about how the Republican leadership is to blame for the passage of the Iran Deal \u2014 in his segment, Beck later lamented that, for him, things are \u201cfar worse than it was when the Democrats had control\u201d \u2014 these guys seem to know very, very little about how Congress works.\n\nAs Brian Beutler wrote in The New Republic earlier today, this is a feature of the modern Republican Party, not a bug:\n\nTo remain in good standing, Republicans must support reducing taxes on the wealthiest Americans dramatically, repealing the Affordable Care Act, subjecting unauthorized immigrants to a police state, and tearing up a global powers agreement to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions. They must question or deny the existence of climate change, promise to vanquish all of the threats the Obama administration poses to the country, and in most instances reflexively refuse to join policymaking coalitions with Democrats. None of this is politically sustainable, but for the past several years, Republicans have used it as a basis for legislative strategy\u2014whipping up thin congressional majorities for indefensible legislation, as if priming members for a future moment when they can impose the party\u2019s agenda on the country all at once. After the 2014 midterm landslide, National Review warned Republicans not to fall into a \u201cgoverning trap,\u201d when their efforts could be better spent \u201cputting up legislation that Senate Democrats filibuster.\u201d This strategy has for the most part precluded compromise, but in so doing has showcased just how little Republicans have done to curb liberal ambitions.\n\nThe GOP establishment has buttered its bread on blanket denials of all manner of realities, many of which have to do with the basic machinations of government, making promises on which they had no chance of following through in light of Democratic vetos and filibusters. And for all of Donald Trump\u2019s racism and bombast, much of his staying power has to do with his legitimate critique of the GOP that when they made all of these promises, they absolutely knew they had no chance of following through.\n\nNot that Trump can, either. But at this point, these voters are willing to try anything.\n\nSo enter Gohmert, who, despite having been in Congress since 2005, somehow does not understand how bills become laws. It doesn\u2019t matter if President Obama has the votes in the Senate to protect the deal; he simply feels that John Boehner and Mitch McConnell can wave their magic leader wands and make it all go away.\n\nThat isn\u2019t how government works, but if Louie Gohmert thinking it is gets him to leave Congress, I\u2019ll take it.\n\n(h/t TalkingPointsMemo)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Louie Gohmert expects John Boehner to wave his magic speaker wand and make the Iran Deal go away.
