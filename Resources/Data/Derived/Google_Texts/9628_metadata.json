This year represents the first year insurers have data to help them price their plans and implement strategies to limit losses and increase profitability, according to a December report by Standard & Poor's Financial Services L.L.C.\n\n\u201cWe would expect to ideally see some of these levers work \u2026 and we would expect to see maybe a lesser decrease in profitability, but some improvement,\u201d Neal Freedman, New York-based insurance credit analyst for S&P, said in an interview.\n\nAccording to the S&P report, low enrollment in the exchange plans has weighed on insurer profits, and individuals that did enroll tended to be high-risk, heavy users of medical care, leading to higher costs for the insurers.\n\nAnd because of the novelty of the exchanges, health insurers lacked the historical data needed to accurately price policies, the report stated.\n\n\u201cLack of complete data not only impedes an insurer's ability to accurately price its products from the start, but also causes issues with repricing accuracy and the ability to obtain required rate increases,\u201d a December report by A.M. Best stated.\n\nFurthermore, one of the reform law's risk-sharing programs failed to provide the safety net it promised.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services announced in October that the risk corridor program, which is meant to provide protection for insurance companies during the first three years of the reform law by providing payments to insurers with excessive claims, would only pay 12.6% of the funds requested by insurers for 2014 losses.\n\nBut now, because 2016 represents the first full year of \u201cactual underwriting data\u201d from the exchange population, according to the S&P report, insurers may be able to implement strategies to limit losses.\n\n\u201cWe're coming into 2016 with the first year with data, and companies are looking at that data and they're saying what arrows do I have in my quiver?\u201d Mr. Freedman said. \u201cThis includes things like narrower networks, like not offering the more precious metals \u2014 your gold and platinum plans \u2014 eliminating certain products, (and) ramping up (their patients') medical management.\u201d\n\nIt also includes raising insurance premiums for consumers and excluding estimates of risk-corridor payments from pricing calculations, he said.\n\nPremiums on the rise\n\nIn fact, premiums are rising: CMS announced in October that insurance rates for benchmark silver plans for all counties in the 38 states that used the federal exchange would rise 7.5% in 2016. The majority of enrollees opt for the silver plan.\n\nAnalysts expect these strategies to help stem losses and eventually turn ACA business profitable for health insurers.\n\nAccording to Joseph Marinucci, New York-based S&P insurance credit analyst, the first three years of the public exchanges is a \u201cramp-up period.\u201d \u201cWe factor in an expectation for it to exert pressure on margins,\u201d he said.\n\nOf course, that period may prove to last longer, he said. The amount of capital an insurer has, as well as the portion of ACA business an insurer has in its book, will determine whether that insurer can ride out the storm, according to S&P analysts.\n\n\u201cWe're looking more closely at the period between the end of year three and year five ... where we are beginning to see more stability in the marketplace, more break-even performance, more marginal profitability in certain segments, where everything begins to right size and develop a \u2026 more sustainable market presence,\u201d Mr. Freedman said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Business Insurance", "description": "Federal health exchange plans have largely proved unprofitable for most health insurers, but new underwriting data could help reverse the trend, according to insurance credit analysts.Most health insurers who sold plans on the Affordable Care Act's health insurance exchange in the past two years...", "title": "Health insurers struggle on federal exchange, but new data could limit losses - Business Insurance", "url": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20160106/NEWS03/160109912", "image": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CB/20160106/NEWS03/160109912/AR/0/stephen-hemsley-unitedhealth-group-ceo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "title": "Health insurers struggle on federal exchange, but new data could limit losses - Business Insurance", "description": "Federal health exchange plans have largely proved unprofitable for most health insurers, but new underwriting data could help reverse the trend, according to insurance credit analysts.Most health insurers who sold plans on the Affordable Care Act's health insurance exchange in the past two years...", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "image_src": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/assets/rwd/bi-logo-footer.png"}, "article_summary": "Federal health exchange plans have largely proved unprofitable for most health insurers, but new underwriting data could help reverse the trend, according to insurance credit analysts.\nAnalysts expect these strategies to help stem losses and eventually turn ACA business profitable for health insurers.\nAnd because of the novelty of the exchanges, health insurers lacked the historical data needed to accurately price policies, the report stated.\nBut now, because 2016 represents the first full year of \u201cactual underwriting data\u201d from the exchange population, according to the S&P report, insurers may be able to implement strategies to limit losses.\nMost health insurers who sold plans on the Affordable Care Act's health insurance exchange in the past two years lost money; nearly half of the health insurance co-ops established by the reform law have folded due to losses; and Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Mexico pulled out of the state-run exchange in August."}
