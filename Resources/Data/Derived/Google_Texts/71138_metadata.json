Sign up for our morning blast HERE\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives erupted into chaos Thursday after Republican lawmakers narrowly defeated an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would have provided protections to members of the LGBT community.\n\nThe amendment, introduced by Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, a New York Democrat, appeared as though it would pass, 217-206, but in the remaining seconds GOP leaders persuaded party members to switch their votes.\n\nThe measure failed by one vote: 212-213.\n\nThe Huffington Post\u2019s Jennifer Bendery reported:\n\nHere\u2019s the before and after votes on striking anti-LGBT language from NDAA. They had it til some GOPers flipped. pic.twitter.com/yokSeFsyOO \u2014 Jennifer Bendery (@jbendery) May 19, 2016\n\nThe Hill reported:\n\nGOP leaders held the vote open as they pressured members to change sides. Infuriating Democrats, they let lawmakers switch their votes without walking to the well at the front of the chamber. Twenty-nine Republicans voted for Maloney\u2019s amendment to a spending bill for the Department of Veterans Affairs and military construction projects, along with all Democrats in the final roll call.\n\nThis prompted chants of \u201cShame! Shame! Shame!\u201d from Democrats as the numbers went from victory to defeat for the amendment.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the ugliest episodes I\u2019ve experienced in my three-plus years as a member of this House,\u201d Maloney, who is openly gay, said.\n\nHe should have been there when Democrats steamrolled in the Affordable Care Act without a single Republican House members\u2019 approval. That was truly ugly.\n\nSign up for our morning blast HERE\n\nC-SPAN video clip via The Hill.\n\nAs for the GOP defeating Maloney\u2019s amendment, reaction was mixed. There were these:\n\n@jbendery Yeah, the government should definitely intervene into businesses because of a word to \u2018protect\u2019 less than 2% of the population. \u2014 John Locke (@LockeJohn_) May 19, 2016\n\n@jbendery If these gasbags need help.,, If you have a penis, your a male, if not, you\u2019re a female.

Hill (@kylejhill) May 19, 2016\n\nStill others realized it wasn\u2019t entirely the Republicans\u2019 doing.\n\n@bwcorb @jbendery Yes, I\u2019m curious about that too. \u2014 Rocketsquirrel (@cristygodin23) May 19, 2016", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "\u201cShame!
