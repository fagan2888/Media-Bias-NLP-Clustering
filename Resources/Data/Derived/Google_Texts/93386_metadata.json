Yet it isn\u2019t Christians who are being told by teachers that they\u2019re stupid or that if they don\u2019t like evolution they should become atheists. No, that is what Christians are doing to non-Christians. Which is no surprise really, since however enlightened some Christians might be today, Christianity has a 2,000 year-old history of this type of behavior.\n\nAt Negreet High School in Sabine Parish, Louisiana, teacher Rita Roark told class of sixth graders that God made the universe 6,000 years ago, that evolution is impossible, and that the Bible is \u201c100 percent true.\u201d Obviously, none of those kids are going to grow up to become astrophysicists without some deprogramming.\n\nHer logic was that, \u201cif evolution was real, it would still be happening: Apes would be turning into humans today.\u201d\n\nApparently, Roark learned logic atthe same school as Ted Nugent.\n\nOne test question stated, \u201cISN\u2019T IT AMAZING WHAT THE _____________ HAS MADE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d\n\nStudents were expected to fill in the blank \u2013 with \u201cLord.\u201d I mean, who else in Louisiana, home of the Duck Dynasty?\n\nOne student, however, who is of Thai descent and who happens to be a Buddhist, declined to play that game and wrote in something else \u2013 \u201cLord Buddha.\u201d Roark chose to respond by publicly humiliating him in front of the class, saying \u201cYes! That is right! I had a student miss that on his test.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t remember that happening when I got a math question wrong. Or science. I don\u2019t remember my teachers feeling the need to have the whole class laugh at me.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t science or math. This is religion. Religion is being taught in our public schools. I thought it was bad enough when my son\u2019s own school snuck in \u201cGod Bless America\u201d at a Broadway musical show put on by the students by appealing to its status as a song from a Broadway play.\n\nBut this is beyond the pale. And it gets worse.\n\nWhen told that the student was Buddhist and did not believe in God, Roark\u2019s response was an outraged, \u201cyou\u2019re stupid if you don\u2019t believe in God.\u201d Sounding more like Nugent with every utterance, she also said Buddhism was itself \u201cstupid.\u201d\n\nWhen his parents complained to Sabine Parish Superintendent Sara Ebarb, Ebarb unhelpfully advised them that \u201cthis is the Bible belt\u201d and that they have to expect to \u201csee God here.\u201d Her solution was that the student change his religion.\n\nOr move to another school district where \u201cthere are more Asians.\u201d This is the option the family eventually took, moving their son to a school 25 miles away.\n\nThe ACLU has taken this case and filed suit. Both the Department of Education and the Department of Justice are investigating. But however it turns out, this is just one more example of how whatever the Religious Right says, the opposite is true. And however it turns out, the way in which it will be presented by the right wing media and by the Republican Party and Religious Right is that a Christian teacher is being persecuted for standing up for her beliefs. Fox News so far has brushed over the incident, without providing a link to the ACLU suit in question, or providing the ugly specifics in the case.\n\nNo mention will be made that the Constitution is being violated, and, in fact, they will; continue to pretend to be protecting the First Amendment of the Constitution.\n\nBecause there is no crime for those who have Christ. It was that way in the fifth century when the Egyptian monk Shenoute burned his Pagan neighbors house, and it is that way today in America, where laws are being formulated to forgive any crime on account of religious belief.\n\nIt is not Christians being persecuted in the United States, but non-Christians: atheists, Buddhists, Muslims, Pagans \u2013 anyone who declines to accept the \u201cLord Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\nAt least the Lord Jesus Christ the Religious Right insists upon. You can bet your bottom dollar Jesus himself would be driven out of these schools if he showed up today. After all, as Ann Coulter said on the Donny Deutsch show, \u201cWe just want Jews to be perfected\u201d and the big strike against Jesus of Nazareth in Evangelical eyes is that the poor guy \u2013 well, besides being poor and unemployed and an immigrant (Nothing good comes out of Galilee) \u2013 was an unperfected Jew.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Louisiana teacher's logic is that \"if evolution was real, it would still be happening: Apes would be turning into humans today.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Hrafnkell Haraldsson", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "The Louisiana teacher's logic is that \"if evolution was real, it would still be happening: Apes would be turning into humans today.\"", "title": "Buddhist Student Told to Change his Religion if he Doesn't Want to be Taught Creationism in School", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/01/25/buddhist-student-told-change-religion-taught-creationism-school.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/creationism.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-01-25T07:35:41+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Issues,Other News,Republican Party,america,Christianity,Christmas,Department of Education,department of justice,duck dynasty,Evolution,louisiana,Negreet High School,Rita Roark,Sara Ebarb,Shenoute,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Republican Party", "published_time": "2014-01-25T07:35:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-25T07:35:41+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "america, Christianity, Christmas, Department of Education, department of justice, duck dynasty, Evolution, louisiana, Negreet High School, Republican Party, Rita Roark, Sara Ebarb, Shenoute"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0cc8\"", "article_summary": "But however it turns out, this is just one more example of how whatever the Religious Right says, the opposite is true.\nI had a student miss that on his test.\u201dI don\u2019t remember that happening when I got a math question wrong.\nIt is not Christians being persecuted in the United States, but non-Christians: atheists, Buddhists, Muslims, Pagans \u2013 anyone who declines to accept the \u201cLord Jesus Christ.\u201dAt least the Lord Jesus Christ the Religious Right insists upon.\nYet it isn\u2019t Christians who are being told by teachers that they\u2019re stupid or that if they don\u2019t like evolution they should become atheists.\nYou can bet your bottom dollar Jesus himself would be driven out of these schools if he showed up today."}
