William Keating, second from right, helps CEO Peter Georgeopoulos, fourth from right cut the ribbon in front of the new center, as other speakers and officials hold the ribbon.\n\nWith the cut of a ribbon, access to healthcare was made easier for thousands of Wareham' residents Tuesday afternoon.\n\nIn anticipation of its official opening on Wednesday, Sept. 2., the Greater New Bedford Community Health Center held its ribbon cutting ceremony Tuesday.\n\nThe center is a private, nonprofit healthcare provider, funded by a $1.4 million grant for the first two years of its operation. Health Center CEO Peter Georgeopoulos said the rest of the operation is dependent on patient billing, through Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n\u201cThere are grants that are available,\u201d Georgeopoulos said. \u201cWe get by, we squeeze by.\u201d\n\nGeorgeopoulos said the center, located in the old Browne\u2019s Liquors building at 127 Marion Road, will provide primary care for all ages. He said the center will not just serve the homeless and underserved population.\n\n\u201cAnybody who comes in for services \u2013 we will see any and all,\u201d Georgeopoulos said. \u201cWe don\u2019t look at their ability to pay or not as an indicator. We look at them as needing services.\u201d\n\nThe center, staffed by 20 people, including one doctor and two nurse practitioners, has 12 adult exam rooms and four pediatric exam rooms.\n\n\u201cWe have nurses, lab techs \u2026 [and] a full-service laboratory,\u201d Georgeopoulos said.\n\nGeorgeopoulos said he expects 11,000 visits to the center before the end of 2015.\n\n\u201cI expect this to fly, because the people really are in need,\u201d Georgeopoulos said. \u201cI think the people are underserved, and really need it.\u201d\n\nJames W. Hunt, Jr., CEO of the Massachusetts League of Community Health Centers, sang the praises of community health centers, which he said were spearheaded in Massachusetts 50 years ago by Sen. Ted Kennedy.\n\n\u201cIt was at the early days of the start of health centers on the South Coast and Cape Cod, of which [there were] three,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cToday, we have about 15 practice sites and still growing.\u201d\n\nU.S. Rep. Bill Keating also spoke in support of the center, saying \u201cit is addressing one of the most basic needs, and one of the scarcest resources we have in the health care system, and that\u2019s the need for primary care.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you are trying to get a physician, and you don\u2019t have one at the time, and you are looking for your first appointment, it could be months away,\u201d Keating said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work that way in real life.\u201d\n\nKeating said he has used community health care centers himself, and said the center\u2019s opening will make life easier for Wareham\u2019s residents who need affordable health care.\n\n\u201cThe people in the Wareham area \u2026 were traveling to New Bedford for these services,\u201d Keating said. \u201cThis will provide those services right here in Wareham, making it accessible, making it easier so you\u2019re not losing time at work.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News", "google-site-verification": "Lxh-TQqnfjqDP3kBHi9EWBzFlV8uaDhicg3nJfqF3Jc", "description": "With the cut of a ribbon, access to healthcare was made easier for thousands of Wareham' residents Tuesday afternoon.\nIn anticipation of its official opening on Wednesday, Sept. 2., the Greater ...", "og": {"url": "http://wareham-ma.villagesoup.com/p/1405464", "image": "http://wareham-ma.villagesoup.com/media/Common/BeaverDam/2015/9/1/1597445/t600-Bick_HealthCenter-1.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "New Bedford Community Health Center opens its doors - By Carolyn Bick"}, "robots": "NOARCHIVE"}, "article_summary": "In anticipation of its official opening on Wednesday, Sept. 2., the Greater New Bedford Community Health Center held its ribbon cutting ceremony Tuesday.\n\u201cI think the people are underserved, and really need it.\u201dJames W.
