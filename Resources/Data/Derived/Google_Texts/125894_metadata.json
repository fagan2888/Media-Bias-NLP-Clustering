McGuigan | Oklahoma Watchdog\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 Seemingly inexhaustable at the age of 89, national conservative leader Phyllis Schlafly believes advocates of limited government will roll back both the Affordable Care Act \u2014 Barack Obama\u2018s signal achievement as president \u2014 and the bipartisan push for creation of national Common Core State Standards for curriculum and instruction in public schools.\n\nIn an interview during a recent visit to the Sooner State, Schlafly, a famed constitutional lawyer from St. Louis, told Oklahoma Watchdog that conservatives \u201clucked out\u201d in being blamed for the shutdown.\n\n\u201cNow the Obamacare issue is the number one story on television and on the Internet. Everything that is coming out is just proving that President Obama lied. He\u2019s taking tremendous heat, and of course he deserves it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a train wreck. His whole program is a train wreck,\u201d she said. It simply cannot work. The whole Obamacare scheme is predicated on young people signing up, but they\u2019re not signing up. If they don\u2019t sign up, it will collapse.\u201d\n\nThe effect could be felt in the midterm elections.\n\n\u201cThe consequence for the president is that his approval rating is plummeting,\u201d she said. \u201cI am hoping this translates into defeating a lot of Democrats next year.\n\nSchlafly, a veteran of every Republican National Convention since 1952, said she\u2019s excited to see the enthusiasm of grass roots opposition to Common Core.\n\n\u201cI must say I\u2019m amazed to see the hundreds of people showing up for meetings on how to organize to beat the Common Core,\u201d she said. \u201cI am seeing scores of meetings and hundreds of people attending, and I didn\u2019t even invite them to come! It\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\nShe thinks the push for the common core as a basis for testing and instructional curriculum \u2014 and in \u201cstrings\u201d for receipt of federal funding \u2014 is backfiring on advocates. Schafly believes the issue is finally getting people excited about public schools.\n\n\u201cThe American people want to control what their children learn, but the educational establishment also wants to control what our children learn,\u201d she said.\n\nSchafly noted that Common Core is only the latest in a number of educational proposals she\u2019s battled in recent years, from Race to the Top to No Child Left Behind.\n\n\u201cIn all of these, federal busybodies have tried to tell us what to do do, how to teach our children, and what they should think. It\u2019s time to put a stop to it.\u201d\n\nContact Pat at pmcguigan@watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Noted Missouri conservative Phyllis Schlafly believes limited government advocates will roll back Obamacare and Common Core standards.", "title": "Phyllis Schlafly hopes conservatives can stop Obamacare, Common Core - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/11/Jenni-Phyllis-Sara-Jo-042.jpeg", "updated_time": "2013-11-06T10:52:28+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/114823/phyllis-schlafly-hopes-conservatives-can-stop-obamacare-common-core/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Missouri", "tag": "Affordable Care Act,Arne Duncan,Barack Obama,Common Core,Education,Health Care,Jeb Bush,oklahoma watchdog,Phyllis Schlafly,Republican National Convention", "published_time": "2013-11-06T10:05:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-06T10:52:28+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Noted Missouri conservative Phyllis Schlafly believes limited government advocates will roll back Obamacare and Common Core standards.", "creator": "@watchdogorg", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/11/Jenni-Phyllis-Sara-Jo-042.jpeg"}, "title": "Phyllis Schlafly hopes conservatives can stop Obamacare, Common Core - Watchdog.org", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Noted Missouri conservative Phyllis Schlafly believes limited government advocates will roll back Obamacare and Common Core standards."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddf90\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI must say I\u2019m amazed to see the hundreds of people showing up for meetings on how to organize to beat the Common Core,\u201d she said.\nSchlafly, a veteran of every Republican National Convention since 1952, said she\u2019s excited to see the enthusiasm of grass roots opposition to Common Core.\nIt\u2019s exciting.\u201dShe thinks the push for the common core as a basis for testing and instructional curriculum \u2014 and in \u201cstrings\u201d for receipt of federal funding \u2014 is backfiring on advocates.\nHe\u2019s taking tremendous heat, and of course he deserves it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a train wreck.\nHis whole program is a train wreck,\u201d she said."}
