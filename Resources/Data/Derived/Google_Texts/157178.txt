Chelsea Clinton suggested this week that her mother and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton would use executive action to unilaterally keep health care costs down for those who have to pay “crushing” costs under Obamacare or who are still trying to buy insurance.

The clip can be found on the Weekly Standard’s website and shows Chelsea Clinton telling an audience that her mother thinks either working with Congress or executive action will help those burdened under Obamacare.

“ … cap out of pocket expenses. This was part of my mom’s original plan back in ‘93 and ‘94 as well as premium costs,” Clinton said. “We can either do that directly or through tax credits. And, kind of figuring out whether she can do that through executive action or she would need to do that through tax credits working with Congress. She thinks either of those will help solve the challenge of kind of the crushing costs that still exist for too many people who even are part of the Affordable Care Act and buying insurance.”

Hillary Clinton has touted on the campaign trail how she worked for universal health care as first lady and that Obamacare was first called Hillarycare.

She has defended the Affordable Care Act as an important step to universal coverage but has said that the landmark legislation turns full-time jobs into part-time jobs as employers try to keep their own costs down.

Clinton’s primary challenger, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt), a self-declared socialist, has criticized Clinton for not being aggressive enough in striving for universal health care.
