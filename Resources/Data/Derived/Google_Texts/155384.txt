The Bishop Carroll football team is coming off an undefeated regular season and nearly rode that momentum to a 5A State Title last year.

This year, they return eight starters on each side of the ball and a defense you don't want to mess with - a defense that gave up less than 12 points a game last season.

On Saturday Coach Alan Schuckman said this year's defensive unit should be even better than last years.

"We basically have one rule on defense and that's get 11 guys to the ball and be angry when you get there, and they'll take advantage of every opportunity. They're going create turnovers and give us a great chance to win every Friday night."

Bishop Carroll will kick the season off at Northwest on September 5th.
