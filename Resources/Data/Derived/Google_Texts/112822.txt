Three people were hospitalized Saturday afternoon after two separate car accidents on Interstate 820 in Fort Worth.

Fort Worth Fire Department officials said one adult and one child were in a Jeep Cherokee when it crashed into a pillar near Azle Avenue. Both were hospitalized in critical condition, according to paramedics.

Shortly after, a driver struck two cars, sending both into a ditch. One person was taken to John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth. Nine others were treated and released at the scene, a MedStar spokesman said.
