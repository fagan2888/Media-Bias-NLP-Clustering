Appearing on “Fox and Friends” Tuesday morning, host of the History Channel’s “Pawn Stars” Rich Harrison said that small businesses were hurting because of government interference, placing the blame on Obamacare in particular.

“Is government really hurting small businesses like you guys?” asked host Brian Kilmeade.

“Yeah, it’s really difficult to do business sometimes,” Harrison replied. “Just from my little pawn shop, the insurance from my employees went from $19,000 a month to thirty [thousand dollars].”

“I have 60-year-old women working for me that have to have pregnancy coverage now,” he said, blaming Obamacare. “I have some of the squarest ex-cops working for me that now need to have drug rehab.”
