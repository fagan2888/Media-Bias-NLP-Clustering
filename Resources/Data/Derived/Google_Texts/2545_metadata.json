I just don\u2019t see how he has that authority.\n\nOn a practical side, insurers are going to have an extremely difficult time pricing their insurance coverage because they priced it based on insurance pools being of a certain size and Obamacare going into effect.\n\nExaminer: If a lot of Americans choose to keep their current health plans, how would that effect the financial viability of the Obamacare exchanges?\n\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Grassley: Keep Google out of video programming Companies like Google have been eyeing the reams of consumer data that they could harvest from the boxes.\n\nCollins: The Affordable Care Act is based on having very large pools of largely healthy people to subsidize the ill. And the law has resulted in high-risk pools going away in most states, if not all states, so it\u2019s an entirely different approach. Now, with the delay of the employer mandate, with the fine for not signing up being only $95, which is a lot cheaper than insurance, and with the system in total chaos, and with choices being limited, I just don\u2019t see how the system can work.\n\nExaminer: What are the prospects that the cost of insurance developed for 2015 will rise significantly?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
