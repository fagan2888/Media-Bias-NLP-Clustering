(AP) \u2014 A 17-year-old girl being forced by state officials to undergo chemotherapy for her cancer says she understands she\u2019ll die if she stops treatment but it should be her decision.\n\nThe state Supreme Court ruled Thursday state officials aren\u2019t violating the rights of the girl, Cassandra C., who has Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nCassandra told The Associated Press in an exclusive text interview from her hospital that it disgusts her to have \u201csuch toxic harmful drugs\u201d in her body and she\u2019d like to explore alternative treatments.\n\nShe said she understands \u201cdeath is the outcome of refusing chemo\u201d but she believes in \u201cthe quality of my life, not the quantity.\u201d\n\nThe court ruled Cassandra\u2019s lawyers had the opportunity to prove she\u2019s mature enough to make that decision during a Juvenile Court hearing in December and failed to do so.\n\nCassandra will be free to make her own medical decisions when she turns 18 in September. She, with the support of her mother, had fought against the six-month course of chemotherapy.\n\nThe case centered on whether the girl is mature enough to determine how to treat her Hodgkin lymphoma, with which she was diagnosed in September. Several other states recognize the mature minor doctrine.\n\nCassandra was allowed to go home to undergo treatment in November but instead ran away for a week, according to court documents.\n\n\u201cCassandra either intentionally misrepresented her intentions to the trial court or she changed her mind on this issue of life and death,\u201d Chief Justice Chase T. Rogers said.\n\nCassandra is confined in a room at Connecticut Children\u2019s Medical Center in Hartford, where she is being forced to undergo chemotherapy, which doctors said would give her an 85 percent chance of survival. Without it, they said, there was a near-certainty of death within two years.\n\nThe teen\u2019s mother, Jackie Fortin, of Windsor Locks, said after the arguments Thursday that she wouldn\u2019t allow her daughter to die. The single mother said she and her daughter just want to seek alternative treatments that don\u2019t include putting the \u201cpoison\u201d of chemotherapy into her body.\n\n\u201cThis is her decision and her rights, which is what we are here fighting about,\u201d Fortin said. \u201cWe should have choices about what to do with our bodies.\u201d\n\nFortin and her lawyer said they are considering their next step after losing the case but expect to go back to the trial court in an attempt to more fully explore the mature minor argument.\n\nAfter Cassandra was diagnosed with high-risk Hodgkin lymphoma, she and her mother missed several appointments, prompting doctors at Connecticut Children\u2019s Medical Center to notify the state Department of Children and Families, court documents say.\n\nThe child welfare agency investigated and a trial court granted the agency temporary custody of Cassandra. Lawyers for Cassandra and her mother then sought an injunction prohibiting medical treatment but were unsuccessful.", "article_metadata": {"description": "HARTFORD, Conn.
