Schweitzer has clear presidential ambitions, and he\u2019s not just positioning himself as an alternative to Hillary Clinton, but he wants to run as a liberal repudiation of Obama. Here\u2019s more:\n\nA Schweitzer presidential candidacy would be a long shot by any measure. He has no national profile and a heterodox political persona that\u2019s served him well in rural, libertarian, and energy rich Montana but doesn\u2019t necessarily sync with the average Democratic primary voter. Clinton, while still undeclared, is such an overwhelming favorite that donors-in-waiting are already competing for territory.\n\nBut what Schweitzer does have is a message that\u2019s unique in the likely Democratic field. The former governor is gambling that Democrats won\u2019t just want an alternative to Clinton in 2016\u2013they\u2019ll want a complete and total rejection of the Obama presidency.\n\nSchweitzer is best described as a left-libertarian or \u201cliberaltarian\u201d; he\u2019s skeptical of the NSA, pro-single payer and pro-marriage equality, but he opposes strict gun control and denounces the Affordable Care Act as \u201ccorporatist,\u201d borrowing an attack that\u2019s popular on the Right. Indeed, he seems designed to bridge the oft-discussed \u201cwine track\u201d/\u201cbeer track\u201d divide in the Democratic Party, with positions that appeal to educated elites and working-class whites.\n\nBut the Democratic divide has as much to do with race as it does with class, and that\u2019s where Schweitzer runs into problems. I think the \u201cwine track\u201d/\u201cbeer track\u201d divide in the Democratic Party is overstated, but insofar that it exists, it turns on the allegiance of working-class African Americans. Sizable support from black voters is key to winning a Democratic presidential primary, and if there\u2019s a long-standing weakness to left or left-leading candidates, it\u2019s that they\u2019ve never had that appeal.\n\nWhat made Barack Obama unique, after all, was his ability to combine heavy African American support with \u201cwine track\u201d constituencies to form a majority coalition, whereas\u2014previous contests\u2014blacks were more likely to support the establishment choice.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jbouie"}, "keywords": "U.S. Politics", "publicationDate": 201401151808, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/voxbox/jamelle-bouie", "description": "Positioning yourself against President Obama is a good way to alienate the most important constituency in the Democratic Party.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Why Brian Schweitzer Has Already Lost", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Why Brian Schweitzer Has Already Lost\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/01/15/why-brian-schweitzer-has-already-lost-2016.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/01/15/why-brian-schweitzer-has-already-lost-2016/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46659241.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/01/15/why-brian-schweitzer-has-already-lost-2016\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-01-15T18:08:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"\",\"author\":\"Jamelle Bouie\",\"tags\":[\"u_s_politics0\"]}", "news_keywords": "US Politics", "tags": "u_s_politics0", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Jamelle Bouie", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-15T18:08:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/jamelle-bouiehtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/01/15/why-brian-schweitzer-has-already-lost-2016", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Positioning yourself against President Obama is a good way to alienate the most important constituency in the Democratic Party.", "title": "Why Brian Schweitzer Has Already Lost", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/01/15/why-brian-schweitzer-has-already-lost-2016.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/01/15/why-brian-schweitzer-has-already-lost-2016/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1399777256386.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/j/jamelle-bouie", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbf42\"", "article_summary": "Over at MSNBC, Benjy Sarlin has a profile of former Montana governor Brian Schweitzer that\u2019s worth a read.\nHere\u2019s more:A Schweitzer presidential candidacy would be a long shot by any measure.\nBut the Democratic divide has as much to do with race as it does with class, and that\u2019s where Schweitzer runs into problems.\nBut what Schweitzer does have is a message that\u2019s unique in the likely Democratic field.\nSchweitzer has clear presidential ambitions, and he\u2019s not just positioning himself as an alternative to Hillary Clinton, but he wants to run as a liberal repudiation of Obama."}
