And definitely mention that US corporate tax rates are the highest in the OECD.\n\nWhen conservative guests justify the war in Iraq, liberals should remind them that a whole generation of college students could have been educated with what was spent.\n\nCembalest goes on. The whole thing is here.\n\nBut before you even need to get to any of these, Cembalest's quick, easy strategy for smoothly navigating the waters of contentious topics with friends and family is all about music:\n\nIf dinner table discussions become too contentious, put on some music that progressives and conservatives enjoy equally, according to Facebook's Data Sciences group. Instead of the polarizing sounds of Beyonc\u00e9, Bob Marley and Neil Young on one side, and George Strait, Hank Williams Jr and the Zac Brown Band on the other, here are some artists that both groups like: Metallica, Taylor Swift, Aerosmith and Elvis.\n\nWe're not sure that everyone loves Metallica, or in what ways Bob Marley has ripped America apart. It's also not clear that the music you like is in any way connected to your political affiliation.\n\nEither way.\n\nHappy holidays!", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Akin Oyedele", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "This made us cringe.", "creator": "AkinOyedele", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/jp-morgans-tips-for-holiday-family-dinner-2015-12", "image": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/5667302684307626008b86e7-506-253/jpmorgan-heres-some-ammunition-for-your-next-dinner-party.jpg", "title": "JPMORGAN: Here's some 'ammunition' for your next dinner party", "site": "themoneygame", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "moneygame,clusterstock,politics", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "JP Morgan, Holidays, Christmas, Akin Oyedele", "description": "This made us cringe.", "author": "Akin Oyedele", "sailthru.date": "2015-12-12", "sailthru.title": "JPMORGAN: Here's some 'ammunition' for your next dinner party", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/56672ff2c28144be008b86b9-50-50/jpmorgan-heres-some-ammunition-for-your-next-dinner-party.jpg", "news_keywords": "JP Morgan, Holidays, Christmas, Akin Oyedele", "tbi-image": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/56672ff2c28144be008b86b9/jpmorgan-heres-some-ammunition-for-your-next-dinner-party.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2015-12-12", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/akin-oyedele"}, "sailthru.description": "This made us cringe.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "This made us cringe.", "title": "JPMORGAN: Here's some 'ammunition' for your next dinner party", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/jp-morgans-tips-for-holiday-family-dinner-2015-12", "image": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/5667302684307626008b86e7-1190-625/jpmorgan-heres-some-ammunition-for-your-next-dinner-party.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "JPMORGAN: Here's some 'ammunition' for your next dinner party", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/56672ff2c28144be008b86b9/jpmorgan-heres-some-ammunition-for-your-next-dinner-party.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "moneygame"}, "article_summary": "Like everyone else, Wall Street strategists let their hair down around this time of year, which is when JPMorgan Asset Management puts out its slightly offbeat note to clients.\nIt's also not clear that the music you like is in any way connected to your political affiliation.\nWe're not sure that everyone loves Metallica, or in what ways Bob Marley has ripped America apart.\nOr, when a debate about higher personal taxes starts, argue that the US tax code is the most progressive it has been since 1955.\nAnd definitely mention that US corporate tax rates are the highest in the OECD."}
