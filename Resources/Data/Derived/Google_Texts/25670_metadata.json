This weekend\u2019s \u201cStarTalk\u201d was between Neil deGrasse Tyson and Ann Druyan, \u201cCosmos\u201d creator, executive producer and co-writer, who just won a Creative Arts Emmy.\n\nThe lovely conversation covers how Druyan met Carl Sagan \u2014 whom she was married to \u2014 creating the original \u201cCosmos\u201d series, writing to keep people hooked during commercials, the \u201cCosmos\u201d reboot and everything in-between.\n\n\u201cCosmos is that intersection where your brain, your heart, your eye, your ear, your soul can all be operating at full tilt,\u201d Druyan explains. \u201cIt is not any one important human component at the expense of the other. So, in other words, no fantasy, which breaks the laws of science. No science that is demoted of its awe-inspiring impact. You\u2019re allowed to feel. You\u2019re not allowed to lie, you\u2019re not allowed to distort, or deceive yourself or others. No, you\u2019ve got to be straight about how the universe is put together. You\u2019ve got to be honest. But to me it\u2019s the greatest source of that soaring feeling there is.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a recent \"StarTalk\" broadcast, Tyson talks to \"Cosmos\" co-writer and executive producer Ann Druyan VIDEO", "author": "Sarah Gray", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In a recent \"StarTalk\" broadcast, Tyson talks to \"Cosmos\" co-writer and executive producer Ann Druyan VIDEO", "title": "Go behind the scenes of \u201cCosmos\u201d with Neil deGrasse Tyson and creator Ann Druyan", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/18/go_behind_the_scenes_of_cosmos_with_neil_degrasse_tyson_and_creator_ann_druyan/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/Cosmos-Neil-deGrasse-Tyson-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In a recent \"StarTalk\" broadcast, Tyson talks to \"Cosmos\" co-writer and executive producer Ann Druyan VIDEO", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/Cosmos-Neil-deGrasse-Tyson-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Go behind the scenes of \u201cCosmos\u201d with Neil deGrasse Tyson and creator Ann Druyan", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Go behind the scenes of \u201cCosmos\u201d with Neil deGrasse Tyson and creator Ann Druyan", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Ann Druyan, Carl Sagan, Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, Neil degrasse Tyson, Science, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb17e\"", "article_summary": "This weekend\u2019s \u201cStarTalk\u201d was between Neil deGrasse Tyson and Ann Druyan, \u201cCosmos\u201d creator, executive producer and co-writer, who just won a Creative Arts Emmy.\nTopics: Ann Druyan, Carl Sagan, Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, Neil degrasse Tyson, Science, Video, Innovation News, Life NewsIf you\u2019ve been aching for more brilliance from \u201cCosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey,\u201d or if you just need something uplifting during this bleak summer news cycle, look no further.\nYou\u2019re allowed to feel.\nYou\u2019re not allowed to lie, you\u2019re not allowed to distort, or deceive yourself or others.\n\u201cCosmos is that intersection where your brain, your heart, your eye, your ear, your soul can all be operating at full tilt,\u201d Druyan explains."}
