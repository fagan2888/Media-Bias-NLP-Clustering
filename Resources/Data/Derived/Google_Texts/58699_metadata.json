Mr. Kellen couldn\u2019t imagine such software coming from Microsoft a year ago, before it began its strategy developing for rival operating systems. But since Satya Nadella was named CEO in 2014, the company has prioritized mobile and cloud software with an emphasis on cross-platform support. It has publically embraced Linux for Azure and developed a number of applications for various mobile platforms, including an Office productivity suite for the iPad.\n\nSimon Dawson/Bloomberg A logo sits on display outside the Microsoft Corp. pavilion at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, on Wednesday, March 4, 2015.\n\nCIOs say Microsoft\u2019s actions are restoring their confidence in a company they had come to view as proprietary, technologically stagnant, and tone deaf to their requirements. \u201cThey aren\u2019t assuming that Windows is the center for everything anymore,\u201d Mr. Kellen said.\n\nThe philosophy is trickling down to Microsoft\u2019s sales representatives who are no longer simply pitching the monolithic twin towers of Office and Windows, which comprised roughly $40 billion of the company\u2019s $86.83 billion in revenue for fiscal year 2014, ended June 30.\n\nMichael Sajor, CIO of Apollo Education Group, stopped meeting with Microsoft sales executives a few years ago because they tried to sell him software without bothering to learn about it would help him run his business. \u201cThey were, all-around, just a pretty ugly company to deal with,\u201d Mr. Sajor said.\n\nBut Mr. Sajor said the company is showing \u201csigns of life\u201d improving its focus under Mr. Nadella. Now Microsoft representatives ask how they can better support the 250,000 University of Phoenix students for whom Mr. Sajor provides technology. Two months ago, Apollo converted from the on-premises Office software to Microsoft\u2019s Office 365 productivity software, which includes the version of Office for iPad. He said the company still has some work to do to solidify customers\u2019 trust in the company, but he\u2019s optimistic in his experience with the company under Mr. Nadella. \u201cIf they stay on track, they\u2019ll win our hearts and minds like other companies have done by becoming real partners,\u201d Mr. Sajor said.\n\nOver the past few years, Chico\u2019s FAS Inc. had shifted spending from Microsoft to Google and iOS applications and development tools, says CIO Eric Singleton. He said Mr. Nadella\u2019s \u201cengineering focus\u201d has him rethinking his position as software licenses come up for renewal and the company explores new technology areas. \u201cThe desire to invite Microsoft into our tent a little bit further is more pronounced at our company than it would have been three years ago,\u201d Mr. Singleton said.\n\nAnalysts have also noticed a shift. Customers think Microsoft has \u201cturned around and is heading in the right direction,\u201d said David Smith, a Gartner Inc. analyst who spoke to about three dozen clients about Microsoft over the past year. Although it\u2019s too early to say whether CIOs are increasing their spending with Microsoft, customers are generally receiving Microsoft\u2019s cross-platform support well, he said.\n\nAt the University of Kentucky, Mr. Kellen plans to boost his spend with Microsoft, which currently runs between $1 million and $2 million a year. He says he\u2019s moving to Office 365 by the end of the year. He plans also to increase his use of Microsoft\u2019s.NET development software and broaden use of Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud software from testing to production as he shift\u2019s more of the school\u2019s resources to the cloud.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in 15 years, I feel like they\u2019re innovative again,\u201d Mr. Kellen said. \u201cMicrosoft is getting its groove back.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "CIOs say Microsoft's multiplatform approach is restoring their confidence in a company they had come to view as proprietary, technologically stagnant, and tone deaf to their requirements. \"They aren't assuming that Windows is the center for everything anymore,\" says Vince Kellen, the CIO of the University of Kentucky.", "title": "Microsoft Has Its \u2018Groove Back,\u2019 Say Some CIOs", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2015/03/09/microsoft-has-its-groove-back-say-some-cios/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HH812_0309_c_P_20150309125803.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "CSuite", "article.headline": "Microsoft Has Its \u2018Groove Back,\u2019 Say Some CIOs", "description": "CIOs say Microsoft's multiplatform approach is restoring their confidence in a company they had come to view as proprietary, technologically stagnant, and tone deaf to their requirements. \"They aren't assuming that Windows is the center for everything anymore,\" says Vince Kellen, the CIO of the University of Kentucky.", "article_section": "CSuite", "author": "Clint Boulton", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "CIO Journal.
