Based on how those polled said they would allocate preferences, it was even more dire for the Liberals: 59-41 to Labor. Most disturbing for Napthine, however, was that one in three said their voting intention was influenced by Abbott\u2019s budget.\n\nThe obvious explanation for this state being so bad for Abbott is simple enough: Victoria is the least conservative state in a country being led by one of the most conservative prime ministers in memory.\n\nScott Morrison\u2019s proud boast this week, when he told Parliament that \u2018\u2018stopping the boats is just the start for this government; we are just getting warmed up\u2019\u2019, may resonate in western Sydney, but it worries many with small-l liberal values, especially in the leafy suburbs of Melbourne.\n\nVictoria is also the country\u2019s best exemplar of multiculturalism, with the second-biggest population of Chinese-born voters and biggest population of Indian-born voters. Many are unnerved by Abbott\u2019s determination to wind back protections against racial discrimination by repealing section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act in order to enhance free speech.\n\nThere is also growing anger within these communities at one of the federal budget\u2019s lesser-known nasties: changes to family reunion laws that mean the only option for those wishing to bring their parents to Australia is to pay more than $100,000 for the necessary visas.\n\nAs the president of the Federation of Chinese Associations, Vincent Chow, sees it, both issues have damaged the Abbott government\u2019s standing and \u2013 by association \u2013 hurt Napthine\u2019s prospects.\n\nAnother ingredient is the lack of Victorian faces at the upper levels of Abbott\u2019s cabinet. Kevin Andrews, Andrew Robb, Greg Hunt and Bruce Billson are all capable ministers, but are hardly household names and none are leadership contenders.\n\nThe Liberal brand has also been tarnished by the state party\u2019s handling of the challenge posed by anti-abortion independent Geoff Shaw and, most recently, by the determination of some to trash the standing of Baillieu, whose decency is respected across the political spectrum.\n\nThe circulation to Liberal Party members of the recording of a private conversation between Baillieu and Sunday Age state political editor Farrah Tomazin prompted some awkward questions for all, but none more awkward than what motivated those behind the exercise.\n\nIf the aim was to force Baillieu out of Parliament, it won\u2019t succeed. Those usually not prone to conspiracy theories fear something altogether more sinister: an attempted takeover of the party by hardline conservative forces. Either way, the effect has been to turn the political spotlight on the Liberal Party\u2019s own deep divisions and deflected it from Napthine\u2019s attempts to sell a solid pre-election budget.\n\nThe investigation is also pointing towards an awkward conclusion, with a senior staffer in the office of a Victorian federal minister suspected of playing a key role in the skulduggery. No wonder voters have trouble differentiating between federal and state.\n\nIt all adds up to what one insider dubbed a perfect storm, with no easy recovery path in either sphere. Rooting out the saboteurs is the job of state director Damien Mantach; restoring the faith with the middle ground is the bigger challenge for Abbott and Napthine.\n\nNapthine craves clear air, but is thwarted by his own side; Abbott needs to remove the distractions that suggest ideology is driving him. The best outcome on 18C, assuming he will not retreat, would see a watered-down change defeated in the Senate.\n\nPrudence would also suggest that the Prime Minister keeps his distance from his \u2018\u2018second home\u2019\u2019, at least until Victorians have delivered their verdict in the November state election, and concentrate on reconnecting next year.\n\nMichael Gordon is political editor of The Age.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Comment", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Tony Abbott&rsquo;s strategy to win last year&rsquo;s election involved visiting Victoria, on average, once a fortnight, claiming Melbourne as his &lsquo;&lsquo;second home&rsquo;&rsquo; and forging a working relationship with the man who led the Liberals back into power at a state level, Ted Baillieu.", "title": "Abbott is no jewel in the Liberal crown as the Victorian election nears", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/comment/abbott-is-no-jewel-in-the-liberal-crown-as-the-victorian-election-nears-20140627-zsoh9.html", "image": "http://images.smh.com.au/2014/02/12/5155383/FAIRFAX-logo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://images.smh.com.au/2014/02/12/5155383/FAIRFAX-logo.jpg"}, "title": "Abbott is no jewel in the Liberal crown as the Victorian election nears", "description": "Tony Abbott\u2019s strategy to win last year\u2019s election involved visiting Victoria, on average, once a fortnight, claiming Melbourne as his \u2018\u2018second home\u2019\u2019 and forging a working relationship with the man who led the Liberals back into power at a state level, Ted Baillieu.", "card": "summary", "site": "@smh"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "Tony Abbott\u2019s strategy to win last year\u2019s election involved visiting Victoria, on average, once a fortnight, claiming Melbourne as his ..."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9db9\"", "article_summary": "Prudence would also suggest that the Prime Minister keeps his distance from his \u2018\u2018second home\u2019\u2019, at least until Victorians have delivered their verdict in the November state election, and concentrate on reconnecting next year.\nNapthine craves clear air, but is thwarted by his own side; Abbott needs to remove the distractions that suggest ideology is driving him.\nBased on preferences at the last election, the poll had Labor in front on two-party terms, 56-44.\nAdvertisementFast-forward to this week and it is hard to comprehend how far the Liberal Party has fallen, at a state and federal level, in the state that produced its founder and most towering figure, Sir Robert Menzies.\nVoters generally distinguish between state and federal governments and issues, but the extent of the Liberal malaise was highlighted in a separate Age-Nielsen poll of state voting intentions."}
