Lena Dunham fired back at the National Review and a right-wing news site called Truth Revolt on Saturday after they quoted sections of her memoir “Not That Kind of Girl” and alleged that she had committed “sexual abuse ” of her younger sister.

The anecdote in question involves a story Dunham tells in the book from when she was seven years old and, while playing in the family driveway, checked to see if her one-year-old sister’s vagina looked the same as hers.

The National Review piece described scenes from the book as “some very disturbing behavior that would be considered child abuse in many jurisdictions” and “the sort of thing that gets children taken away from non-millionaire families without Andover pedigrees and Manhattanite social connections.”

Here’s how Dunham responded:

The right wing news story that I molested my little sister isn't just LOL- it's really fucking upsetting and disgusting. — Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) November 1, 2014

And by the way, if you were a little kid and never looked at another little kid's vagina, well, congrats to you. — Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) November 1, 2014

Usually this is stuff I can ignore but don't demean sufferers, don't twist my words, back the fuck up bros. — Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) November 1, 2014

I told a story about being a weird 7 year old. I bet you have some too, old men, that I'd rather not hear. And yes, this is a rage spiral. — Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) November 1, 2014
