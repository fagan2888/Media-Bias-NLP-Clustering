The latter is what Kardashian decided to do recently as part of being Glamour\u2019s July cover girl.\n\nSharing her letter to future Kim of 2025, Kim Kardashian wrote during a video for Glamour, that she hopes that the future 44-year-old Kim will be \u201ckind\u201d and \u201cpatient\u201d with her tween, Nori West.\n\nShe starts the letter off by typing, and narrating, \u201cDear Kim, When you read this you\u2019ll be ten years older in the year 2025. I hope this is where you are.\u201d\n\nFrom there she goes into discussing the importance of body maintenance. That must be at the forefront of her mind seeing as she\u2019s currently expecting her second child with husband and rapper Kanye West. \u201cWhen it comes to how you feel about your body, remember to be kind to yourself and enjoy how you look now, because you\u2019re not getting any younger.\u201d\n\nKardashian also noted that her daughter, Nori \u201cNorth\u201d West, will be a pre-teen, and by her own thoughts, it seems like she\u2019s expecting those years to be a little tough.\n\n\u201cMay you continue to feel blessed and grateful. Since North is now 12, I hope you remember that pre-teens are going through a lot. I know junior high is really tough, so remember to have a lot of patience.\u201d\n\nThat said, Kim Kardashian, who can come off as narcissistic, doesn\u2019t always make it about herself. In her letter, she stated that she does have wishes for her family members.\n\nFor Khloe, who has been through her own set of struggles, Kim said, \u201cI hope Khloe finds her happily ever after and falls madly in love because she really deserves it.\u201d\n\nFor Kourtney Kardashian, she said, \u201cI hope Kourtney is maybe done with having babies. She has a lot on her plate and I know she doesn\u2019t want to stop anytime soon.\u201d\n\nAs for sister Kendall Jenner, Kim wrote, \u201cI hope Kendall will continue modeling and do whatever she loves to do.\u201d\n\nLastly, there\u2019s sister Kylie Jenner, who Kim hopes she continues to do whatever she wants, \u201cbecause she\u2019s not usually one to take any direction.\u201d\n\nThe only sibling she left out was her brother Robert Kardashian, who she isn\u2019t on the best of terms with.\n\nKardashian didn\u2019t end it on an obvious sour note, but instead she took the letter back around to herself again. \u201cI trust that you will still be the queen of contouring. May science invent a mysterious and delicious green juice to keep you tan forever.\u201d\n\nShe continued, addressing her haters, \u201cWe both know that there are always so many haters out there, and I just hope you continue to ignore them and focus on everything positive.\u201d\n\nOf course, Kim has real world questions for 2025 Kim.\n\n\u201cAre you still filming Keeping Up with The Kardashian?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre selfies still a thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre the terms bae and on fleek so 2015?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf not, am I still on fleek?\u201d\n\nAlso, her one wish is to break the 100 billion mark on Instagram.\n\nCheck out the video here.\n\n[Photo by Rick Diamond / Getty Images]", "article_metadata": {"description": "When you're Kim Kardashian, you can spend your days taking selfies, publishing a selfie book, and even writing a letter to your future self.
