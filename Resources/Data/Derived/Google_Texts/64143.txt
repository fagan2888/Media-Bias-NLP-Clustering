WARRENS, Wis. (AP) - Ocean Spray is shooting its signature cranberry commercial in central Wisconsin for the first time.

Production crews, actors and Ocean Spray employees have been working to shoot a year’s worth of commercials at Beltz Cranberry Co. in Warrens. The Massachusetts-based company only has a small timeframe to create all of the footage it will need since cranberries are harvested in the fall.

Ocean Spray has been airing ads that feature two cranberry farmers standing in a bog for 10 years. Its longstanding TV campaign was traditionally shot in the same small cranberry bog in Carver, Massachusetts.

The commercial needed a “little freshening up,” Courtney Nunley, who was involved in the shoot as the vice president and marketing director at Arnold Worldwide, told Daily Tribune Media (http://wrtnews.co/1pHTTuJ ). Ocean Spray chose to shoot it in Wisconsin because it produces more cranberries than any other state, she said.

“We had a desire to shake the campaign up a little bit,” Nunley said.

The actors will remain the same, but the new backdrop gives the commercial the boost that it needed, according to the advertising agency official.

“The sky is so much bigger, and the landscape gives us totally different angles,” Nunley said.

The Wisconsin cranberry marsh is much bigger and flatter than the one that’s appeared in Ocean Spray commercials for years.

“We were just excited to capture it in a way we hadn’t before,” Nunley said about the campaign.

The commercials are expected to debut next year.
