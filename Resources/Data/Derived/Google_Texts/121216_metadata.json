Abrams revealed to Jimmy Fallon that he and Lin-Manuel Miranda have written brand-new music for the film\u2019s upcoming \u201cCantina\u201d scene.\n\nTony-winning actor-composer-lyricist-rapper Miranda is the brains behind the runaway Broadway hit \u2014 he wrote the musical and stars as Alexander Hamilton.\n\nAs Abrams told the story while visiting \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d Miranda had come up to him during intermission the night the director had gone to see \u201cHamilton\u201d \u2014 Miranda wasn\u2019t performing that evening \u2014 and joked, \u201cHey, if you need music for the Cantina, I\u2019ll write it!\u201d\n\nBut what Miranda didn\u2019t realize was that Abrams did indeed have an updated Cantina scene for the new movie: \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Does he know?\u2019\u201d And as luck would have it, Abrams further revealed that \u201cStar Wars\u201d and original Cantina theme composer John Williams had respectfully requested that he not write new music for the scene in question so he could focus on the score. The best part of this anecdote is learning that Williams calls Abrams \u201cJ.J. baby.\u201d\n\nSo Abrams e-mailed Miranda, and asked if he would write the new Cantina music for real.\n\nMiranda\u2019s response? \u201cI\u2019ll drop everything!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never discussed this before,\u201d said Abrams. \u201cHe might kill me for revealing this.\u201d\n\nJudging from Miranda\u2019s confirmation tweet, it\u2019s safe to say Abrams will live long enough to see the film\u2019s premiere on Dec. 18.\n\nWe did. Worked on it between 6pm & 7:30 on 2 show days for the past 2 months. JJ is the best.
