Bloomberg News\n\nIran is creeping back onto the radars of Western businesses and investors, but not without controversy.\n\nLondon\u2019s plush Marriott Hotel is this week playing host to the first Europe-Iran Forum. The gathering, which ends on Thursday, has been organized by Brussels-based business newspaper and events company the European Voice. Its aim is to capitalize on growing interest in the Iranian market following last year\u2019s interim agreement with leading world powers over the Islamic Republic\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nStaff from several high-profile companies have attended, including representatives from U.S. firms such as telecoms equipment giant Cisco Systems and Citigroup, according to a list distributed at the conference. France\u2019s oil giant Total and cosmetics maker L\u2019Or\u00e9al, along with European aerospace company Airbus Group and Swedish automaker Scania Group were at the event.\n\nMohammad Nahavandian, the chief of staff of Iran\u2019s president Hassan Rouhani sent a message of support for the forum in an official letter.\n\nBut even though the event was packed, some attendees still seemed in two minds about dealing with Iran. That\u2019s hardly surprising given the legal and reputational difficulties that remain. Despite exemptions on goods such as food, medicine or sales of car and aircraft parts to Iran, the most stifling sanctions on its banking and oil sectors remain in place.\n\nAhead of the conference, the U.S. Treasury warned participants not to breach continuing economic sanctions against the Islamic Republic. A group of Israeli protesters filmed attendees at the entrance of the hotel.\n\nEven the forum\u2019s most high-profile business speaker on Wednesday, Martin Sorrell, the head of advertising giant WPP, appeared conflicted about his involvement. \u201cI have mixed emotions about being here\u201d Mr. Sorrell said in his speech. At a personal level, he said, he would be against dealing with Iran until it \u201crecognizes the legitimacy of Israel.\u201d Most countries in the Middle East don\u2019t recognize Israel.\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s Zionist Federation had asked Mr. Sorrell to reconsider his attendance in a letter sent on Monday.\n\nStill, Mr. Sorrell said, the opportunities in Iran are \u201cimmense.\u201d He cited Iran\u2019s huge oil and gas reserves and its highly educated, young population. \u201cApart from Mars and the Moon\u201d there are not many untapped opportunities left of that scale, he said.\n\nAside from WPP, very few U.K. companies turned up to the conference. The reasons for their absence were unclear, but British firms frequently complain that the U.K. government has been among the most cautious in allowing any renewed trade with Iran.\n\nWrite to Beno\u00eet Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.com.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Attendees at a London conference on doing business in Iran displayed mixed feelings about investing in the country.", "title": "London Conference Highlights Cautious Optimism Toward Iran", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/10/15/london-conference-highlights-business-ambivalence-toward-iran/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FA508_fronti_P_20141015153102.jpg"}, "site": "frontiermarkets", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "London Conference Highlights Cautious Optimism Toward Iran", "description": "Attendees at a London conference on doing business in Iran displayed mixed feelings about investing in the country.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Benoit Faucon", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Frontier Markets Blog", "page.subsection": "Frontier Markets", "article.summary": "Attendees at a London conference on doing business in Iran displayed mixed feelings about investing in the country.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-10-15T20:09:23-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-157", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/10/15/london-conference-highlights-business-ambivalence-toward-iran/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-265B-1262", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Attendees at a London conference on doing business in Iran displayed mixed feelings about investing in the country.", "title": "London Conference Highlights Cautious Optimism Toward Iran", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/10/15/london-conference-highlights-business-ambivalence-toward-iran/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FA508_fronti_P_20141015153102.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Frontier Markets", "article.id": "BL-265B-1262", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-10-17T17:50:38-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9d7e\"", "article_summary": "The U.K.\u2019s Zionist Federation had asked Mr. Sorrell to reconsider his attendance in a letter sent on Monday.\n\u201cI have mixed emotions about being here\u201d Mr. Sorrell said in his speech.\nStill, Mr. Sorrell said, the opportunities in Iran are \u201cimmense.\u201d He cited Iran\u2019s huge oil and gas reserves and its highly educated, young population.\nMixed messages: Even the day\u2019s highest-profile speaker, Martin Sorrell, was in two minds about investing in Iran.\nFrance\u2019s oil giant Total and cosmetics maker L\u2019Or\u00e9al, along with European aerospace company Airbus Group and Swedish automaker Scania Group were at the event."}
