Nick Lehr/The Conversation\n\nThough Shakespeare\u2019s death didn\u2019t attract much attention in 1616, it\u2019s big news today.\n\nTo mark its 400th anniversary, there has been no end of events, whether it\u2019s the Folger Library\u2019s First Folio Tour to all 50 states or a production of \u201cHamlet\u201d that, to date, has been performed in 196 countries. As far away as Tehran, performances and exhibits have been organized. Closer to home, in New Orleans, two full-blown \u201cjazz funerals\u201d will commemorate the occasion.\n\nWhen thinking about the reasons for Shakespeare\u2019s enduring popularity, you could point to his facility with language, his ability to deliver moments that possess both poetic complexity and heartrending simplicity.\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that his plays are ripe for adaptation, which has allowed \u201cTimon of Athens\u201d to be set during the Occupy movement and \u201cOthello\u201d to be adapted to contemporary India for a Bollywood film.\n\nBut many feel most attracted to Shakespeare\u2019s characters, who seem to have lives that transcend the stage.\n\nAt the time, Shakespeare was crafting portraits of psychological depth \u2013 full of doubt, hypocrisy and mystery \u2013 in ways that none of his contemporaries were. His characters hold up so well that we continue to see Shakespeare\u2019s imprint on today\u2019s most popular television shows and films.\n\nCrafting a psychological landscape\n\nMost of us know what it is to feel heartsick, jealous, blinded by ambition or disappointed by ingratitude. Romeo, Othello, Macbeth, and King Lear \u2013 all seem to have anticipated and expressed our own emotional experiences better than we could. Our mistrusted politicians are so many Julius Caesars and Lady Macbeths, our ill-fated lovers Romeos and Juliets, our ingenious heroines Rosalinds and Portias.\n\nShakespeare\u2019s men and women are both archetypal and still so modern partly because, like no others before them, they grapple with inner conflicts. Soliloquies and dialogue become not only sources of information for the audience but also lead to action; in other words, whereas the plots of earlier plays depended on what the characters did, Shakespeare\u2019s plays seemed to progress and develop because of what the characters thought.\n\nTake Hamlet, who grapples with fear and doubt about avenging his father\u2019s murder; he\u2019s disturbed by the potential injustice of the act, and the prospect of risking his sanity, or even his soul, if he follows through.\n\nCharacters before Shakespeare\u2019s time may have feared the act of revenge, but more due to the potential consequences of failure than out of the spiritual and psychological anguish that might accompany success.\n\nIn his characters, the allure of the unknown\n\nStaging these internal conflicts within the plays helps make the characters feel relevant today, and may account for why the best television and film characters are sometimes called Shakespearean.\n\nThe lead figures of HBO\u2019s \u201cTrue Detective,\u201d PBS\u2019s \u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d and the Netflix documentary \u201cMaking a Murderer\u201d all struggle to resolve internal unrest, some of which is mysterious to us \u2013 and even to them.\n\nIn \u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d Lady Mary Crawley\u2019s interest in her suitors often waxes or wanes without incident or explanation; her coldness to Edith is sometimes retributive, but sometimes a random attack \u2013 not unlike Hamlet\u2019s spontaneous railing at Ophelia.\n\nIn the documentary \u201cMaking a Murderer,\u201d mystery is, of course, central. But our sense of mystery is intensified because we cannot even be sure if Brendan Dassey knows whether he is guilty of a crime or not.\n\nShakespeare didn\u2019t simply create characters who possess inner turmoil. He also constructed the characters in ways that were likely to stir up doubt among readers and spectators. For many of his characters, key details are omitted; we don\u2019t know what to think \u2013 and this can create an illusion of psychological depth.\n\nTake Hamlet. He\u2019s not mad: he tells his companions plainly that he will feign madness to avoid suspicion while carrying out his plan for revenge. But Shakespeare allows him to go too far, causing audiences to wonder whether he has actually gone mad.\n\nNor do we understand why Hamlet wavers, why Lear so rashly disowns his loyal daughter, why Iago is so embittered against Othello. Likewise, programs like \u201cTrue Detective\u201d leave critical information out. It\u2019s difficult to tell whether Rustin Cohle\u2019s daughter\u2019s death, his failed marriage and former drug use are worthy of blame, sympathy or both. We see the current struggle and must guess at and fear the details and motives that underlie it.\n\nNot fully good, nor entirely evil\n\nShakespeare was also adept at blurring the lines between good and evil.\n\nOthello and Macbeth commit murders, but other characters seem at least as responsible as they are. So when Othello says at the end of the play that he \u201cloved not wisely, but too well,\u201d an audience can believe him, despite staring at the wife he strangled. Macbeth must be shamed into regicide by a wife who mocks his manhood, suggesting that he is \u201ctoo full o\u2019the milk of human kindness.\u201d Ironically, only loyalty to her can move him to treason.\n\nIt is this \u201ckindness,\u201d in its root sense, that is a major source of energy and interest for characters like Macbeth and Othello. We grasp their humanity because their moral inconsistencies make them more like the people we meet (and the people we are); depending on the day or point of comparison they \u2013 like us \u2013 can be friendly or indifferent, generous or spiteful, loyal or faithless.\n\nWhen Vince Gilligan sat down to write \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d he sought to transform television by making a protagonist that evolved into an antagonist, a character that would both attract and repel the audience. Walter White enlists audiences to support him \u2013 he is a teacher, he is dying, he cares about his family \u2013 and to continue that support even as he becomes loathsome.\n\nAs viewers, we\u2019re generically inclined to support the cops over the criminals; at the same time, we cannot resist becoming attracted to, and even siding with, a drug dealer like D\u2019Angelo Barksdale (\u201cThe Wire\u201d), whose blend of swagger and diffidence, intelligence and good humor render him more human than some of the brutal officers out to imprison him.\n\nThe last two decades have been called a golden age for television. Shows like \u201cThe Wire,\u201d \u201cMad Men,\u201d and \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d have attained the status of high art, and they\u2019ve deservedly been praised for their innovations. But it\u2019s worth considering that they have resurrected the type of moral complexity and ambiguity Shakespeare was able to achieve.\n\nSuch internal conflicts are not always pleasant for audiences. But they make it difficult to look away. Because of Shakespeare, they\u2019ve been at the center of some of the most successful popular entertainment for over 400 years.\n\nBrett Gamboa, Assistant Professor of English, Dartmouth College\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2016/04/23/in-todays-most-popular-shows-shakespeares-iconic-characters-live-on/", "article_author_name": "Brett Gamboa", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/image-20160421-27007-7bgrfn.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "anniversary, birthday, characters, death, hamlet, iconic, pop culture, references, television, william shakespeare"}, "description": "Though Shakespeare\u2019s death didn\u2019t attract much attention in 1616, it\u2019s big news today.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/image-20160421-27007-7bgrfn.jpg"}, "keywords": "hamlet,william shakespeare,birthday,death,anniversary,television,pop culture,references,iconic,characters", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In today\u2019s most popular shows, Shakespeare\u2019s iconic characters live onPrinted from: http://newbostonpost.com/2016/04/23/in-todays-most-popular-shows-shakespeares-iconic-characters-live-on/Both Hamlet and \u2018True Detective\u2019\u2019s Rust Cohle make audiences wonder whether they\u2019re deserving of sympathy or blame.\nBut many feel most attracted to Shakespeare\u2019s characters, who seem to have lives that transcend the stage.\nHis characters hold up so well that we continue to see Shakespeare\u2019s imprint on today\u2019s most popular television shows and films.\nRomeo, Othello, Macbeth, and King Lear \u2013 all seem to have anticipated and expressed our own emotional experiences better than we could.\nIt is this \u201ckindness,\u201d in its root sense, that is a major source of energy and interest for characters like Macbeth and Othello."}
