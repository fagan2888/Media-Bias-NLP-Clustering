It increases spending $112 billion over the next two years, busting the spending caps. It does nothing to defund Planned Parenthood. It reinstates the Wind Production Tax Credit. It funds Obamacare. It quardruples H2-B visas for low-skilled workers at the expense of American workers. It fails use the power of the purse to rein in a single one of Obama\u2019s economy crippling regulations. It funds the Department of Housing and Urban Development racial and income zoning quotas being imposed on 1,200 counties and cities that accept any portion of $3 billion of annual community development block grants.\n\n\u201cThe omnibus does not advance Republican priorities, or even the American people\u2019s priorities, it advances the priorities of the power elite in Washington, D.C. that continues to operate within a vacuum.\u201d\n\nHow did your federal representatives vote? You can find the House vote here, and the Senate vote here.\n\nOf the presidential candidates in the Senate, Senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul predictably voted \u201cNay\u201d on this bad bill; Senator Marco Rubio did not vote. Senator Lindsey Graham-nesty voted \u201cYea.\u201d\n\nSo how did \u201cSouth Dakota common sense and conservative values\u201d in Washington D.C. do today? Not so good.\n\nSenator John Thune amazed us and voted \u201cNay\u201d on the Obama agenda in both the cloture vote and the final vote. Could there be hope to reverse the drift to the Left of the man who defeated Tom Daschle in 2004?\n\nOle \u201cSouth Dakota common sense and conservative values\u201d FHA-endorsed Senator Mike Rounds voted for it. I\u2019m sure glad conservatives got a \u201cRepublican\u201d in that Senate seat last year; if we hadn\u2019t, that seat might have a score even lower than Mike Rounds\u2019 20% rating (since this vote hasn\u2019t been scored by Conservative Review yet, it won\u2019t be as high as 20% for long). After all, Democrats are about the only ones with lower ratings than ole \u201cSouth Dakota common sense and conservative values\u201d Mike Rounds.\n\nAnd Rep. Kristi Noem predictably went along with the RINO House leadership and voted to fund the Obama agenda.\n\nYou know, I could have sworn\u2013sworn\u2013that Republicans told me last year that if we elected them, they\u2019d stop the Obama agenda for us.\n\nWhat happened to that? Did they leave their guts in their home states? Their principles, too?\n\nI don\u2019t see much stopped\u2026except Republican principles, and the traditional limited government values that used to make this nation great.\n\nWith Republicans who\u2019ll ensure a Leftist \u201cfundamentally transforming America\u201d agenda gets funded, who needs Democrats?\n\n\n\nThis article is printed with the permission of the author(s).
