In Zubik v. Burwell, a group of religious nonprofits is challenging the government\u2019s accommodation for employers who don\u2019t want to have anything to do with providing birth control to their workers. Dahlia speaks with former U.S. Solicitor General Paul Clement, who argued the case for the plaintiffs, and to former acting U.S. Solicitor General Walter Dellinger, who supports the government\u2019s position.\n\nThis week\u2019s excerpts from the Supreme Court\u2019s public sessions were provided by Oyez, a free law project at the Chicago-Kent College of Law, part of the Illinois Institute of Technology.\n\nTranscripts of Amicus are available to Slate Plus members.
