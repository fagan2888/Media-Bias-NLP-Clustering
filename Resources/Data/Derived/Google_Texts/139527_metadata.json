He took a nap after a night of partying and never woke up.\n\nTucker's parents had no idea he had even tried the drug. But authorities say it wasn't his first time.\n\n\u201cBilly's not the only one using this,\u201d said his father, Steve Tucker. \u201cA 10-year-old can buy this stuff. That's what's scary.\u201d\n\nSynthetic marijuana is readily available online \u2014 so much so that the brand and seller options are overwhelming. Authorities don't know where Tucker bought his, but a search of his phone showed that he had been looking for it online, mostly using social media.\n\nA handful of Omaha businesses questioned by The World-Herald said they don't carry synthetic marijuana. Most forms are illegal to sell and use in Nebraska and Iowa, but newer versions with a different chemical makeup are being legally sold in some areas.\n\nLike its herbal counterpart, synthetic marijuana \u2014 or K2, as it's sometimes called \u2014 promises a high.\n\nBut it also can cause seizures, high blood pressure and, in cases like Tucker's, death.\n\nNebraska and Iowa lawmakers, health care workers and law enforcement officials are scrambling to get out the warning.\n\n\u201cIt's high school kids, college kids using this,\u201d said Dr. Ron Kirschner, a toxicologist at the Nebraska Poison Control Center. \u201cIt's easy to get ... and sold on the Internet. They usually say they don't contain banned illegal substances or are not for human consumption.\u201d\n\nToxicology reports released last week showed that Billy Tucker overdosed on Scooby Snax Potpourri. Steve Tucker said his son bought the drug before a party.\n\nLancaster County Chief Deputy Jeff Bliemeister said the death investigation revealed that others at the party were smoking marijuana.\n\nJoanie Huss, clinical manager of Journeys, a Catholic Charities facility in Omaha that treats teens with substance abuse problems, said most of her clients have used heavier, illegal drugs but start using synthetic marijuana as a second choice because it goes undetected in the drug screenings used by treatment facilities and authorities.\n\n\u201cThey switch to K2 because of the detection piece,\u201d she said, \u201cnot because it's that great of a high. They'd rather have the real thing.\u201d\n\nBliemeister said Tucker bought the legal version because a previous infraction required that him to submit to court-ordered drug tests.\n\nToxicology reports found K2 in his system, but the investigation into his death has been complicated by a lack of knowledge about lethal levels of synthetic marijuana. The ingredients differ in the various forms of the drug, and the products affect individual users differently.\n\n\u201cThese drugs aren't tested,\u201d Kirschner said. \u201cThey're just produced, and people are saying 'Let's just see what happens' without having any idea of the effect on the body.\u201d\n\nTeenagers \u201care the guinea pigs,\u201d said Christine Gabig, a forensic scientist for the Douglas County crime lab.\n\nThe synthetic versions of marijuana can cause anxiety and hallucinations similar to the effects of LSD.\n\nAnd there's nothing natural about it. Various chemicals are turned into powder form. The powder is dissolved in nail polish remover and then sprayed on a plant substance. K2 is smoked using a pipe or rolled in cigarette paper.\n\nIn 2009, 15 kinds of synthetic marijuana were on the market. Two years later, that number had risen to nearly 3,000, according to the U.S. Justice Department.\n\n\u201cThe drug scene is changing,\u201d Gabig said. \u201cPeople are making their own high to fit chemically into the receptors of their brains.\u201d\n\nGabig also has seen more sinister forms of K2 hit the market.\n\n\u201cA person doesn't know what they're getting in each packet,\u201d she said. \u201cThat's kind of a recipe for disaster.\u201d\n\nState Sen. Beau McCoy of Omaha wants any and all versions of synthetic marijuana banned in Nebraska.\n\n\u201cWe've gone a long ways toward where we need to go, but certainly there's going to be an enterprising organization ... that's creating something new,\u201d said McCoy, whose legislation outlawed older forms of the drug. \u201cWhat's really scary is that these get more and more dangerous each successive generation of these synthetic drugs.\u201d\n\nBliemeister, the chief deputy, said his department is working with schools to educate people on the dangers of K2.\n\n\u201cWe really want parents, kids and school administrators to know that stuff is not without extreme danger,\u201d he said, \u201cand that using it is bad.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "Like its namesake mountain peak, K2 offers a legal but sometimes fatal high, one victim's parents say.", "title": "'A 10-year-old can buy' synthetic marijuana", "url": "http://www.omaha.com/news/a--year-old-can-buy-synthetic-marijuana/article_c972a404-bbd8-5ca0-bcf4-e41fbe33a0b0.html", "image": {"width": 760, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/cd/bcd22d13-ad7c-5485-afc5-0fad95483950/5332e85eeb77a.image.jpg?resize=760%2C504", "height": 504}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@OWHnews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Like its namesake mountain peak, K2 offers a legal but sometimes fatal high, one victim's parents say.", "fb": {"app_id": 117714391577072}, "keywords": "news", "google-site-verification": "gE-kSjgMAF16OyUU3QCB0Ap0PQnFlh5oPdueJO6D2cQ", "news_keywords": "news"}, "article_summary": "Beau McCoy of Omaha wants any and all versions of synthetic marijuana banned in Nebraska.\nA handful of Omaha businesses questioned by The World-Herald said they don't carry synthetic marijuana.\nBilly Tucker, 18, of Greenwood is the first Nebraskan known to have died from an overdose of synthetic marijuana.\nIn 2009, 15 kinds of synthetic marijuana were on the market.\nLike its herbal counterpart, synthetic marijuana \u2014 or K2, as it's sometimes called \u2014 promises a high."}
