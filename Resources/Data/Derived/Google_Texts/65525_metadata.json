NFL Network reported on Saturday that Griffin will remain on the team and serve as the backup, but that Colt McCoy would carry that duty in Week 1 until Griffin is cleared.\n\nAs the team approached Saturday\u2019s 4 p.m. deadline to finalize the 53-man roster, the uncertainty of Griffin\u2019s status posed an interesting series of questions.\n\nWould the Redskins cut him as they trimmed the 53-man roster? Would it be worth it for the team to keep him as a backup, despite the fact that they would be on the hook for over $16 million in 2016 if he got injured and did not pass his exit physical? And most importantly, would it create a distraction keeping Griffin if he wasn\u2019t starting?\n\n\u201cThe only distractions, like I said, are made out here,\u201d Gruden said Sunday, alluding to the media. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel like he\u2019s a distraction at all. We feel like he\u2019s a quarterback that\u2019s young and talented and done some great things.\n\n\u201cYou can never have too many quarterbacks in your building. It\u2019s very important. We learned that the hard way last year. You never want to use three, but it\u2019s a violent game and quarterbacks are at risk back there, so it\u2019s important to have three good quarterbacks. When you have three, you want to hold onto them.\u201d\n\nGruden also dismissed the notion of any trade rumors involving Griffin.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything of that sort. All I know is we made decisions on our 53-man roster. He\u2019s one of our 53. That\u2019s all we\u2019re going by now. We\u2019re going to get all our guys ready to play.\u201d\n\nLast Monday, Gruden announced that Cousins will be the starter for the regular season. Cousins was the team\u2019s most efficient quarterback in the preseason, completing 40 of 53 passes for 435 yards, including two touchdowns and an interception.\n\nThe confusion surrounding Griffin\u2019s status began after Week 2 of the preseason when he sustained a concussion against the Lions. Griffin was initially cleared for the Week 3 game against the Ravens \u2014 the game in which starters get the most reps as a final rehearsal ahead of the regular season.\n\nSoon after, independent neurologist Robert N. Kurtzke ruled that Griffin was in fact not ready for game action, forcing the Redskins to start Cousins against Baltimore.\n\nCousins was 20-for-27 with 190 yards, a touchdown and an interception in the first half before McCoy took over, as the Redskins took a 31-13 victory.\n\nIt appeared McCoy was going to serve as Cousins\u2018 backup after a strong preseason showing. With Griffin unavailable, McCoy played all of Thursday\u2019s final preseason game against Jacksonville, completing 22 of 33 passes for 208 yards and a touchdown.\n\nGruden gave McCoy strong reviews ahead of the final preseason game, noting that the six-year veteran didn\u2019t have to do anything to prove himself to the Redskins\u2018 staff.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s done everything we have asked him to do,\u201d Gruden said before Thursday\u2019s preseason game. \u201cHe\u2019s a tough, competitive guy and I think he\u2019s going to go out and compete like he always does. I just know he\u2019s a great competitor and we\u2019re happy to have him on our team.\u201d\n\nYet despite the strong play of McCoy, it should come as no surprise that Griffin is expected to serve as Cousins\u2018 backup once he clears the concussion protocol.\n\nThis season, Griffin is guaranteed more than $3 million, a hefty price tag for a third-string quarterback.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Griffin met with a neurologist Friday but has yet to pass concussion protocol.
