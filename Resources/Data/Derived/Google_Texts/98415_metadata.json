But for some maybe traumas will come back.\u201d\n\nIn violence that had seemed unfathomable in peaceful Norway, Breivik detonated a car bomb in Oslo\u2019s government district before opening fire on a left-wing youth camp on Utoya on July 22, 2011.\n\nEight people were killed in the bombing and 69, mostly teenagers, died in the shooting massacre. Some were shot at point blank as they pleaded for mercy; others drowned in a chilly lake as they fled the island in panic.\n\nDescribing himself as a patriot and militant nationalist, Breivik showed no remorse in his 2012 trial, where he dismissed the victims as traitors for supporting immigration.\n\nHe didn\u2019t appeal his sentence, which can be extended for as long as he\u2019s considered a danger to society. But he soon started complaining about the restrictions he was facing in prison as the sole inmate of a high-security unit, where he has three cells at his disposal.\n\nIn letters to media, including The Associated Press, Breivik accused prison officials of \u201clow-intensity torture\u201d for frequent strip searches and for keeping in him in isolation and preventing him from establishing contacts with other right-wing extremists.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As Norway killer sues for human rights, survivors stay away", "title": "As Norway killer sues for human rights, survivors stay away", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "As Norway killer sues for human rights, survivors stay away", "title": "As Norway killer sues for human rights, survivors stay away", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/12/as_norway_killer_sues_for_human_rights_survivors_stay_away/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/belgium-terror-attacks.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As Norway killer sues for human rights, survivors stay away", "title": "As Norway killer sues for human rights, survivors stay away", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/belgium-terror-attacks.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Karl Ritter", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Eight people were killed in the bombing and 69, mostly teenagers, died in the shooting massacre.\n\u201cI won\u2019t read newspapers that week,\u201d said Dag Andre Anderssen, who survived Breivik\u2019s shooting massacre on Utoya island and is the deputy leader of a support group for survivors and the bereaved.\nSome survivors will try to ignore the four-day trial starting Tuesday in a gym-turned-courtroom inside Skien prison, where Breivik is serving a 21-year sentence for terrorism and mass murder.\nGone from the public eye for four years, Norway\u2019s worst mass killer is suing the government over his solitary confinement, which he says is inhumane.\nHe didn\u2019t appeal his sentence, which can be extended for as long as he\u2019s considered a danger to society."}
