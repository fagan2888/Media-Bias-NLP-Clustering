Elections: Off-year elections can be revealing, and 2015’s was no different. In local contests nationwide, voters gave a big thumbs-down to candidates and causes favored by the Democratic Party’s far left.

Are Americans tired of the proliferating nanny-state intrusions in their lives? Sure looks that way. From East Coast to West Coast, North to South, local voters on Tuesday mostly said “no” to activist government and radical social changes.

ObamaCare, pot legalization, the minimum wage and a host of other liberal initiatives went down in flames, while moderate to conservative candidates — and even a Tea Partyer or two — made gains. A few key results:

 Kentucky: The state embraced ObamaCare, built its own exchange, expanded Medicaid and set up a nonprofit insurance co-op. Now, after its health co-op failed, voters elected anti-ObamaCare Republican Matt Bevin as governor by 53% to 44%. Newly elected Lt. Gov. Jenean Hampton is a Tea Party member and the first black to hold statewide office ever.

 Virginia: The GOP kept its 21-19 edge in the Senate and 2-1 majority in the House of Delegates, repudiating Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who sought to expand Medicaid and enact harsh gun-control laws.

 Texas: The so-called Houston Equal Rights Ordinance to guarantee gays, lesbians, transgender and 13 other classes of people “equal rights” was routed 61% to 39%. Foes successfully argued it would have let men dressed as women use women’s bathrooms.

 Washington: Tacoma rejected an immediate rise in the city’s minimum wage to $15 an hour. Across the country in Maine, 58% of voters in Portland, the largest city, also rejected a $15/hour minimum.

 Oregon: The liberal state knocked down a spate of proposed local tax hikes on sales and gasoline, and in Coos County enacted a powerful new gun rights law.

 Ohio: A move to legalize marijuana for recreational use was nixed by 65% of voters. Even many libertarian supporters didn’t like the proposal, which would have created a monopoly to control pot sales.

 California: Ultraliberal San Francisco voters rejected Prop. F, a measure to curb Airbnb, an Uber-like app for short-term home rentals. Voters also fired Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi after an illegal alien he let out of jail murdered tourist Kate Steinle last July.

Tuesday’s losses were so bad that even the White House took note, issuing a statement disavowing any responsibility by President Obama for the debacle.

“We’d be reluctant to draw significant conclusions,” said White House spokesman Josh Earnest. Not so reluctant was the liberal Washington Post: “President Obama is toxic, even in nonfederal elections,” it said.

Based on Tuesday’s results, the progressive strain of Obamaism that has so damaged our nation’s economy and civic life seems to have crested and crashed. We hope more electoral change is on the way.
