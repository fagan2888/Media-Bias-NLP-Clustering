Illinois could become one of the three, with the state Senate already approving it and the House possibly taking it up in November.\n\nThe amendment is not without its opponents, however. The Illinois Family Institute claims the ERA would force women into military combat, invalidate privacy protections for bathrooms and locker rooms, undermine child support judgments and jeopardize social payments to widows, according to the Associated Press (AP).\n\nIf the congressional measure for the \u201cthree-state strategy\u201d doesn\u2019t pass, supporters would start the process over again in Congress and then try to win approval from 38 states from scratch. Either approach would appear to be hobbled by the Republican majority in the House.\n\nA sponsor of the legislation is U.S. Representative Jackie Speier (D-California), who told the AP that recent legal rulings make it imperative to adopt the ERA.\n\n\u201cRecent Supreme Court decisions have sent women\u2019s rights back to the Stone Age,\u201d Speier said, referencing the Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby ruling that allowed certain private businesses to opt out of the Obamacare mandate regarding contraception coverage. Co-sponsor Carolyn Maloney (D-New York) agreed. \u201cThey could not have made the Hobby Lobby ruling with an ERA,\u201d she said.\n\nThe states besides Illinois that have not ratified the amendment are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Utah and Virginia. Those states are mostly controlled by conservatives who\u2019ve shown little interest in resurrecting the ERA.\n\n-Noel Brinkerhoff, Steve Straehley\n\nTo Learn More:\n\nDespite Decades of Setbacks, Supporters of Equal Rights Amendment Persevere (by David Crary, Associated Press)\n\nThe History Behind the Equal Rights Amendment (by Roberta W.
