The owner said Obamacare and the high cost of doing business in Vermont contributed to the closing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very expensive all the way around,\u201d Wanda Robar, owner of Benways Taxi, told Vermont Watchdog regarding the cost of doing business in Vermont.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget we have Obamacare coming, too. And for my staff, I knew it wasn\u2019t possible. They didn\u2019t make enough money to really pay what the Vermont health care exchange items are going to cost \u2014 and do cost right now.\u201d\n\nRobar, who took the reins of the company after her late husband, Paul Robar, died in 2011, said neither the family-owned business nor her workers could afford the costs associated with health care.\n\n\u201cI knew that they couldn\u2019t get the subsidies that they could in this year for (the years) coming up. And I knew there was no way I could facilitate that either and make it go over,\u201d she said.\n\nThe decision to close marks an end to a transportation service that holds 34 of the 225 taxi licenses issued by Burlington. Benways, which operates Yellow Cab, Airport Taxi, Apollo Limousine service and Morf Transit, will lay off approximately 70 employees.\n\nAccording to a letter Robar provided to the media, Benways sought buyers among larger transportation firms that could absorb the higher insurance costs. Robar said no firm wanted to assume the risks.\n\nAsked if other companies similarly would be pressured to fold, Robar said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have more. I went because I know what\u2019s to come.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why competing taxi companies hadn\u2019t yet closed, she said, \u201cWell, they weren\u2019t as big\u2026as they get bigger, and they get into a different level, they too will feel the effects of what happens the larger you become.\u201d\n\nPrior to his death in 2011, Paul Robar \u2014 affectionately known to Burlingtonians as \u201cThe Cab King\u201d \u2014 threatened to take Benways out of Burlington as the City Council moved to pass new regulations. As council members pushed for mandatory taximeters to replace the city\u2019s long-standing zone pricing system, Robar threatened to take \u201cevery legal action known to mankind to fight them.\u201d\n\nThe City Council passed the new cabbie regulations July 11, 2011. Robar died five weeks later of a brain aneurysm.\n\nAsked if Burlington regulations contributed to the closing of Benways, Wanda Robar said, \u201cIt\u2019s not as if they just pick on me. It\u2019s everybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe guy next door, he has different regs. But he pays, too.\u201d\n\nThe announcement to close the company drew employees together one last time. When Robar informed employees late Monday, she asked everyone to stick with her through the July 4 holiday weekend.\n\n\u201cI asked them in the room to please show me a show of hands, and it was unanimous that they would finish this with me.\u201d\n\nRobar offered gratitude to her employees, approximately 98 percent of whom were also present at her husband\u2019s funeral three years ago.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful for the staff. I\u2019m honored that they hung tough with me. We did a good job. We\u2019re just at the end of the rainbow.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in honor of her late husband, she said, \u201cThe era is over. He\u2019s gone. He\u2019s not coming back. We will never be the Cab King he was.\u201d\n\nContact Bruce Parker at bparker@watchdog.org", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The owner of Burlington\u2019s largest taxi company says Obamacare and other state and local regulations contributed to the firm's unexpected closing.", "title": "Burlington taxi owner blames Obamacare, regs for closing - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/06/yellowcab-banner2.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-06-19T06:17:11+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/155300/obamacare-shutters-taxi-company/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "News", "published_time": "2014-06-19T04:00:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-19T06:17:11+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The owner of Burlington\u2019s largest taxi company says Obamacare and other state and local regulations contributed to the firm's unexpected closing.", "title": "Burlington taxi owner blames Obamacare, regs for closing - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/06/yellowcab-banner2.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "The owner of Burlington\u2019s largest taxi company says Obamacare and other state and local regulations contributed to the firm's unexpected closing."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdca12\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s very expensive all the way around,\u201d Wanda Robar, owner of Benways Taxi, told Vermont Watchdog regarding the cost of doing business in Vermont.\nThe owner said Obamacare and the high cost of doing business in Vermont contributed to the closing.\nWhen Robar informed employees late Monday, she asked everyone to stick with her through the July 4 holiday weekend.\nAsked if Burlington regulations contributed to the closing of Benways, Wanda Robar said, \u201cIt\u2019s not as if they just pick on me.\nThe decision to close marks an end to a transportation service that holds 34 of the 225 taxi licenses issued by Burlington."}
