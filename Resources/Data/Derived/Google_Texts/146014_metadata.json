The couple turned to Connecticut\u2019s ObamaCare-mandated health exchange to look for a new policy, only to find that every plan offered included a mandatory surcharge that can only be used to fund elective abortions.\n\nWhile federal law forbids taxpayer subsidies for elective abortions, ObamaCare gets around that by requiring every health care exchange plan that provides abortion coverage to charge a dedicated fee to be used exclusively to pay for abortions. Many people don\u2019t know about this fee, however, because ObamaCare bars health care providers from disclosing the information.\n\n\u201cAmericans should not have to pay a special fee for other people\u2019s abortions in order to take care of their own family\u2019s health,\u201d said Casey Mattox, senior counsel for Alliance Defending Freedom, the legal aid organization that represented the Bracys during their lawsuit.\n\nClick \"like\" if you are PRO-LIFE!\n\n\u201cThe Bracy family has experienced first-hand the kind of deception that was used to pass and that continues to pervade this law,\u201d Mattox said. \u201cWhile we are pleased that Connecticut families will now have a choice to avoid paying this abortion surcharge, it is a shame that other families won\u2019t have that choice, and that most Americans don\u2019t even know that they must pay this secret fee.\u201d\n\nAccording to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, people seeking healthcare coverage on ObamaCare exchanges in Hawaii, New Jersey, Vermont, and Rhode Island are currently unable to purchase plans that do not include the abortion surcharge.\n\nMeanwhile, millions of Americans remain unaware that they are funding abortion with their healthcare premiums, due to the ObamaCare requirement that the surcharge be hidden from consumers.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "description": "'Americans should not have to pay a special fee for other people\u2019s abortions in order to take care of their own family\u2019s health.'", "title": "Connecticut couple wins: State will offer ObamaCare plan without abortion coverage", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/lifesite/shutterstock_166155479.jpg", "url": "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/connecticut-couple-wins-state-will-offer-obamacare-plan-without-abortion-co", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "'Americans should not have to pay a special fee for other people\u2019s abortions in order to take care of their own family\u2019s health.'"}, "description": "'Americans should not have to pay a special fee for other people\u2019s abortions in order to take care of their own family\u2019s health.'", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 132010293551131, "pages": 112623813202}}, "article_summary": "Many people don\u2019t know about this fee, however, because ObamaCare bars health care providers from disclosing the information.\nNewsAbortion, Politics - U.S.A pro-life Connecticut couple who sued federal and state officials over the state\u2019s failure to offer health insurance options that don\u2019t force subscribers to subsidize abortions has withdrawn their lawsuit after officials agreed to offer a conscience-friendly health plan that does not include abortion coverage.\nWhile federal law forbids taxpayer subsidies for elective abortions, ObamaCare gets around that by requiring every health care exchange plan that provides abortion coverage to charge a dedicated fee to be used exclusively to pay for abortions.\nMeanwhile, millions of Americans remain unaware that they are funding abortion with their healthcare premiums, due to the ObamaCare requirement that the surcharge be hidden from consumers.\nThe couple turned to Connecticut\u2019s ObamaCare-mandated health exchange to look for a new policy, only to find that every plan offered included a mandatory surcharge that can only be used to fund elective abortions."}
