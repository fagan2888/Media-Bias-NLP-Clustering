(CNN) - Vice President Joe Biden will campaign for the Democratic nominee in a heated House special election in Florida that's widely considered a bellwether race for the 2014 midterms.

Biden will appear at a fundraising event for Democrat Alex Sink, Florida's former chief financial officer, next week, according to an invitation obtained by CNN.

The reception will be held Wednesday at the home of Judy and Michael Adler, two major Democratic donors, in Coral Gables, Florida. Coral Gables is not located in the 13th Congressional District, where Sink is running.

Tickets range from $1,000 to $5,000.

Sink is campaigning against Republican nominee David Jolly, who's seen a bevy of outside Republican groups spend money on his behalf.

The winner will fill the remainder of the late Republican Rep. Bill Young's term, who died in October. Young, who was first elected to Congress in 1970, was the longest serving Republican in the House.

The 13th district covers most of Pinellas County and parts of St. Petersburg. While Young captured 58% of the vote in his 2012 re-election, President Barack Obama narrowly carried the district. Obama also won it 2008, grabbing 51% support.
