(CBSNewYork/AP) \u2014 As the period to enroll for new federal health care insurance nears, many American will be able to receive information and sign up for a plan at a Rite Aid drug store.\n\nU.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius announced Monday at a Rite Aid in Hoboken that independent insurance agents will be placed at 2,000 of the pharmacy chain\u2019s stores nationwide starting in October, WCBS 880\u2019s Monica Miller reported.\n\nWhen the enrollment period for uninsured Americans opens Oct. 1, about 900,000 residents in New Jersey and about two million in New York will become eligible for benefits, Sebelius said.\n\nThe health secretary said that providing information at a drug store makes sense because pharmacists are on the front lines of health care.\n\n\u201cEven as more of our friends go online for information about health care, many still like a face-to-face conversation,\u201d she said.\n\nRite Aid chairman John Standley said the agents don\u2019t work for any of the insurers who offer policies under the new law but will earn a commission for policies they sell.\n\nNew Jersey Republican Steve Lonegan, a U.S. Senate candidate, held a news conference across from the Hoboken Rite Aid calling for an end to the plan\u2019s mandate that Americans purchase health care or pay a penalthy.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t force consumers to buy iPhones, and they sell,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t force consumers to buy Viagra, do we? But Rite Aid sells it, quite profitably. Let them sell their own products. We must delay the individual mandate.\u201d\n\nYou May Also Be Interested In These Stories\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2013 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
