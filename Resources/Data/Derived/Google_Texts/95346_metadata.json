It came just days after Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) said that he would continue his push for expansion despite elections last week that left the GOP in control of Virginia\u2019s House and Senate.\n\nAdministration officials did not dispute the findings but said they were working to fix flaws in the system, some of them exacerbated by a huge spike in applications triggered by the rollout of the Affordable Care Act two years ago.\n\n[McAuliffe says he has a no-cost way to expand Medicaid]\n\nMoments after the report was presented, Republican House leaders held a news conference outside the conference room where the commission was meeting.\n\n\u201cThis report reinforces where we, in the House, have been for the last several years,\u201d said Del. John M. O\u2019Bannon III (R-Henrico), a physician. \u201cThe Medicaid program is not efficient. It\u2019s not lean and clean and mean. There need to be many reforms made.\u201d\n\nDemocrats said some of the flaws were the fault of the Republican-controlled General Assembly because it did not provide Medicaid administrators with more funding for staff and technology. They noted that the legislature rejected a measure that would have required banks to provide applicants\u2019 financial information, making it optional instead.\n\n\u201cThe governor is confident that we can work in a bipartisan way to make some of the changes that legislators have rejected in the past to address these issues,\u201d said Brian Coy, McAuliffe\u2019s spokesman. \u201cIn the meantime, there is no excuse for leaving billions of Virginia taxpayers\u2019 dollars on the table that could be used to expand health care for hundreds of thousands of our friends and neighbors.\u201d\n\nThe audit found problems across the Medicaid system, with delays for people entering and exiting the program. On the front end, 25 percent of applications submitted in the first quarter of this year were approved late, delaying care for more than 11,000 Virginians. On the back end, belated processing for renewals left at least 29,000 recipients on the rolls after they no longer qualified, costing the state at least $21 million in fiscal 2014.\n\nVirginia spent $7.9 billion on Medicaid benefits in 2014.\n\nThe audit also exposed quirks in the system, such as the practice of verifying the income for applicants who claim earnings of $1 or more but taking the word of those who say they have no earnings.\n\n\u201cThe policy around not verifying zero income was a holdover from the days when we had to rely on pay stubs . . . to verify income; there is no paper to verify zero,\u201d said Linda Nablo, chief deputy director of the Department of Medical Assistance Services.\n\n\u201cBut that is no longer the case in the advent of electronic sources, and we should and will be maximizing their use and treat zero-income reporters the same as we treat people who report $1 of income.\u201d\n\nNablo said the agency has gotten more adept in recent years of searching electronic records, examining Internal Revenue Service, Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security data to determine eligibility based on income, citizenship and immigration status.\n\nBut she said, \u201cThere are some areas where we lag behind.\u201d\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, states that allow more people onto their Medicaid rolls can pass most of the cost to the federal government. Once the law is fully implemented in 2020, states are supposed to pay 10 percent. McAuliffe made expansion the centerpiece of his 2013 campaign, saying that it would create 30,000 health-care jobs and provide health-care coverage to needy Virginians.\n\nRepublicans have objected to expanding a program that they say is badly in need of reform.\n\n\u201cWe fought very hard to get his study,\u201d House Majority Leader M. Kirkland Cox (R-Colonial Heights) said. \u201cRemember all the people that said Medicaid has been studied over and over and over again and you\u2019d find nothing new. I think they were wrong.\u201d\n\nSen. Janet D. Howell (D-Fairfax), who favors expansion, said the findings suggests that the state needs to beef up staff and training so it has the resources to verify eligibility and repayment, when appropriate, from the estates of deceased Medicaid recipients.\n\nAfter certain Medicaid recipient die, the state is required under federal law to seek recovery for long-term care expenses, and Virginia also may seek recovery for other Medicaid services. But Virginia does not proactively identify those recipients, the report found, instead relying on heirs or estate attorneys to volunteer the information.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re all in agreement that we need to be more aggressive,\u201d Howell said. \u201cNot only is it wrong, but we can\u2019t afford it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "va politics, vapolitics, virginia politics, virginia medicaid expansion, audit virginia medicaid program,", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Republicans seize on the findings as they fight Gov.
