(AP) - David Greer, a doctor who co-founded a group that won the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize for working to prevent nuclear war and who helped transform the medical school at Brown University, has died. He was 89.\n\nGreer was a founding director of the Nobel-winning International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War. He had heart disease and died Tuesday at his home in Fall River, Massachusetts, said his daughter, Linda Greer.\n\nIn awarding Greer\u2019s Boston-based organization the peace prize, the Norwegian Nobel Committee said it had \u201cperformed a considerable service to mankind by spreading authoritative information and by creating an awareness of the catastrophic consequences of atomic warfare.\u201d\n\nLinda Greer said Thursday that her father was a \u201cvery modest man\u201d and was reluctant to take any personal credit for the award.\n\nColleagues from Brown said Greer was a \u201cvisionary\u201d who taught students about social responsibility. He was Brown\u2019s dean of medicine from 1981 to 1992.\n\n\u201cHis mantra was that medical students had to be science savvy but socially responsible physicians, and his own career in Fall River and Rhode Island were exemplary of that,\u201d said Dr. David Lewis, who worked with Greer to establish a center for alcohol and addiction studies at Brown.\n\nGreer moved to Fall River nearly 60 years ago to practice medicine in a community that didn\u2019t have enough physicians, then went to Brown to train the next generation of primary care physicians, Linda Greer said.\n\nGreer continued to volunteer with local organizations as he advanced at Brown. Bristol Community College President Jack Sbrega said Greer made tremendous contributions as a member of its board of trustees and worked to improve the quality of the educational experience.\n\n\u201cIt was very important to us to have the wisdom he brings to the table,\u201d he said.\n\nAt Brown, Greer founded and led departments for family medicine and community health and a gerontology center.\n\n\u201cHe was a visionary in terms of seeing paths for bringing folks together in ways that often were not the standard or normal approach,\u201d said Vince Mor, a Brown professor and longtime friend of Greer.\n\nGreer was born in New York City\u2019s Brooklyn borough and went to community college before enlisting in the armed forces during World War II. He enrolled at the University of Notre Dame after the war. He studied medicine at the University of Chicago and did his residency at Yale University.\n\nAfter retiring from Brown, Greer served as the medical director for a health care center in Fall River until 1998.\n\nGreer recently helped with a fundraiser for the local YMCA and was planning on doing more volunteer work to keep busy since Marion, his wife of 64 years, died seven weeks ago, Linda Greer said.\n\n\u201cHe stayed very rooted in where he came from and the importance of community,\u201d she said. \u201cEven as his stage became this very giant world stage, that\u2019s how I think about him.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "David Greer, a doctor who co-founded a group that won the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize for working to prevent nuclear war and who helped transform the medical school at Brown University, has died.
