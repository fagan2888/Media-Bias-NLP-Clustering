At least 1,700 youth and young adults ages 12 to 24 are homeless or unstably housed in Colorado. Here in Boulder County, there are as many as 150 youth without a safe place for the night and statistics show that within 48 hours of running away, 30 percent of homeless youth are recruited for sex and other forms of human trafficking and approximately 50 percent have not graduated from high school. Research finds that 40 to 60 percent of all homeless youth have experienced physical abuse.\n\nWith children making up 27 percent of the U.S. homeless population (and the fastest growing segment). the time is now to start factoring teens into our local conversation of homelessness. Living amidst our privileged and beautiful community is a hidden population of unaccompanied youth who are alone, afraid, without family and safe shelter.\n\nThe root causes of teen homelessness are many: poverty, abuse and neglect, LGBTQ rejection, family conflict, child welfare involvement, mental illness and substance abuse. Since 2010, Attention Homes has been tackling Boulder's runaway and homeless youth problem and is the only youth shelter in Boulder County. Providing a continuum of care that includes street outreach, a day drop in center, and overnight emergency shelter, Attention Homes seeks to provide safe housing and access to education, substance abuse support, counseling, family reunification, employment and long-term supportive housing options. We expect to serve over 800 teens in day and overnight shelter by the end of 2014.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll this month, Attention Homes has a campaign of events Sleep Out-Dine Out-Shout Out to educate our community about the harsh realities facing homeless youth and what you can do locally to help. Learn more about this important issue and get involved at AttentionHomes.org.\n\nClaire Clurman\n\nExecutive director Attention Homes", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/letters/ci_26901004/claire-clurman-youth-face-homeless-challenges", "modificationDate": "2014-11-09T18:24:15-0700", "sailthru.section": "Opinion: Letters to the editor", "endDate": "2015-11-09T18:23:49-0700", "description": "November is Colorado Homeless and Runaway Youth Awareness Month.
