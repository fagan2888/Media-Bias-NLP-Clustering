He served on the Council of Economic Advisers and the National Economic Council during the Clinton Administration and has advised the Presidential campaigns of Bill Bradley, John Kerry, and Barack Obama as well as being Senior Health Care Advisor for the Obama Presidential Campaign, where he played a key role in the design of what became the Affordable Care Act.\n\nI caught up with him last week for a Curbside Consult, in which we discussed his new book, The Quality Cure, about the American health care system. In Part 1 of our three-part interview, we talked about what it might take to reduce waste in the U.S. healthcare system and what types of incentives might improve healthcare delivery. In Part 2, we talked about the fact that health care consumers are actually \u201cprice-responsive.\u201d (The problem is getting consumers the cost and quality information they need to compare their options.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s Part 3:\n\nBelow is a transcript of our conversation. It\u2019s been edited to make the translation between spoken and written English.\n\nTranscript of Part 3 (of 3):\n\nRight people, wrong skills?\n\nHarold Pollack: We\u2019ve had such a nice conversation that I have to bring it around to a few icky subjects before I let you go. Why was the rollout of healthcare.gov so unbelievably screwed up?\n\nDavid Cutler: It was really screwed up. It was terrible. It\u2019s something for which all of us supporters took grief, and deservedly so. There were some external reasons and then some reasons internal to the administration.\n\nThe external reasons arose from the fact that Republicans were so universally opposed to it. So it was very difficult going. It was hard to manage things in advance, and so on.\n\nThese problems were dwarfed by the internal reasons. The administration never really thought about management as an area. That is, it never really said: We\u2019re running a big new startup, and we should have someone who knows how to run a startup business doing it.\n\nInstead, they kept the people who were there when the thing was passed and who understandably had an interest in hanging around and helping out. The administration said: why don\u2019t you be in charge of it? There are different skills in life. The skill set of the people who were in charge was not centered in knowing how to run things.\n\nNewspaper and magazine stories have chronicled the mistakes. If you read any management literature, many of these were of the sort that are not supposed to happen when you run a company. You\u2019ve got to figure these things out. You have to know that these problems are occurring, and act to avoid them.\n\nThat was a real mistake, throughout the administration, in not recognizing that this was a very serious challenge that they had to face up to.\n\nHow to run complicated things\n\nHarold Pollack: For those of us who teach in public policy schools, what lessons should we take from this about the craft of public management to minimize the chances that such bad implementation mistakes don\u2019t happen again\u2026? Are there ways that we should be teaching our students differently?\n\nDavid Cutler: I have thought about this. As you know, I wrote a memo about this issue in 2010. It got me a little bit of notoriety [when it was leaked last year] which I would have preferred not to have had. We don\u2019t teach our public policy students enough about how to run complicated things.\n\nIf you think about the skill sets that are needed for something complicated, you clearly need to know the substance like how do you think about designing healthcare policy? It helps to know the politics. That is, someone has to know enough about the politics and the political situation to figure out how to work things.\n\nBut then, the under-done part of the trinity is the management. That is, how to actually make it work. It\u2019s often assumed that once you passed the law, you\u2019ve done all the hard work. All along, I thought that healthcare reform was 30 percent legislation and 70 percent implementation. Newspapers and so on focus on the 30 percent that\u2019s legislation, and they don\u2019t really know how to deal with the 70 percent implementation, but that\u2019s the job of a smart thinking administration, to really focus on that. I don\u2019t know where along the way they fell off.\n\nAlso, I think we almost certainly don\u2019t do enough of that in our public policy or medical or even undergraduate training to try and say: \u201cLook, here\u2019s what we know about the substance of the issues or the politics of the issues and here\u2019s what we know about how to actually do complicated things.\u201d That is just an incredibly under-taught skill.\n\nPoisoned political environment\n\nHarold Pollack: I do believe that the poisoned political environment makes this especially challenging. One way it made it challenging was that Republicans were always trying to sabotage the implementation of the new law. They are still trying to do that in very concrete ways, particularly in underfunding key pieces of the implementation effort.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to solve a really complicated set of challenges like the ACA, you really have to do that in a very pragmatic and transparent way that is very focused on how to identify and solve practical problems. If you\u2019re always looking over your shoulder at a set of adversaries who are trying to shoot down what you\u2019re doing, that\u2019s just really hard to do.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to be in the right mindset to do that because you\u2019re always thinking about how every piece of information that you might publicly discuss might become ammunition for people trying to destroy the legislation.\n\nDavid Cutler: The president made an interesting comment regarding his choice of nominees to replace Kathleen Sebelius as Secretary of Health and Human Services. He said, \u201cI need someone who knows what they\u2019re doing but someone who wasn\u2019t involved in the passage of healthcare, because I need a fresh set of eyes here.\u201d\n\nI wonder if he would have been well served by doing that with regards to implementation a couple of years ago. He might have said: Clearly I need the people who are here because they know things about it. But I also need people who are not embittered or scarred too much by this process who can think outside the box and bring people together as a team with many other folks.\n\nThey might bring in technology people and say: \u201cLook, I don\u2019t need you to learn about politics. I need you to figure out how to do the technology and to work as part of a team on this.\u201d\n\nHarold Pollack: I think that\u2019s wise. There\u2019s another aspect of this, too. I need a group of people who can work well with the insurance companies who are political opponents in some ways, but who are also partners and actually executing much of what has to get done in this new law.\n\nDavid Cutler: Correct. Having people who know the industries well, who know how to run businesses, it struck me at the time that that\u2019s what should be done. I know they had some internal discussion about it. I don\u2019t know why they never did that.\n\nHow to move forward\n\nHarold Pollack: How are you feeling about ACA\u2019s implementation as of May 2014?\n\nDavid Cutler: It\u2019s obviously better. The broken website was huge, and fixing the website is a very big deal. I would still like to see them go further. If you look at what the ACA is, it\u2019s two laws put together in one.\n\nOne is to be able to cover people and set up insurance exchanges and regulate insurance and do the subsidies and all of that. Second is to be able to transform the delivery of healthcare into something that\u2019s cheaper and better. Those are two in essence divisions of the company which is the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIf I were giving recommendations, I would say if you have two divisions, you should have two specific leaders, one in charge of each division. There should be one person whose sole job it is to figure out how we\u2019re going to do all this coverage stuff, be in charge of the website, be in charge of the insurance relations and so on, someone who knows business, by the way.\n\nSimilarly, I need someone who can be in charge of transforming or at least helping, as the government does, to transform the healthcare system because that\u2019s a really important thing to do too \u2026\n\nI think they\u2019ve gone a little bit of the way there in terms of putting someone in charge of the website, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve gone far enough yet.\n\nDealing with politics\n\nHarold Pollack: I wonder if some of the toughest challenges really reflect the depth of our political polarization, we really won\u2019t be able to attack until President Obama leaves office because it\u2019s such a centerpiece of his presidency.\n\nDavid Cutler: I think that\u2019s right. Although, what\u2019s interesting is the movement of Republican governors into the Medicaid expansion is actually fairly impressive. You just had another one the other day, Governor Pence of Indiana.\n\nOnce you get out of Washington, going back a little bit, at the state level, they have to do stuff. Maybe they don\u2019t want to help people, but if it turns out that it\u2019s good to cover and you can convince them of that then maybe they\u2019ll move along. I hope it\u2019s going to be something where Washington is behind the times rather than ahead of the times.\n\nHarold Pollack: Behind the times in the sense that there\u2019s a lot of positive action that\u2019s happening within state governments, within private healthcare organizations that\u2019s really making a better and more humane healthcare system despite the disfigured environment of partisanship in Washington.\n\nDavid Cutler: You see the same thing actually with the ACA itself. People have given up on the repeal. There are very few people who want Congress to take more votes on repealing the ACA. Some people like it. Some people don\u2019t like it. What they want to do is figure out how to fix it. Get it, fix it. Let\u2019s move on.\n\nIt\u2019s a little bit the same way at the state levels. Many of them are saying: \u201cLook, we\u2019re just sick of this. If it\u2019s the right thing to do, let\u2019s figure out a way that it works for us and let\u2019s do it and stop the endless parade of garbage.\n\nFeeling optimistic\n\nHarold Pollack: One final topic before we stop. (There\u2019s much in your book that we didn\u2019t get a chance to talk about, and I\u2019m sorry that we could go a whole other conversation talking about many aspects, comparing the US to Canada, for example,).\n\nA sort of optimism really comes through in your book. A bunch of feasible things are actually being done to really improve our health care system. These are proliferating and becoming best-practice, becoming part of the culture of healthcare. I finished the book thinking that we face big challenges but we are going to have a much better healthcare system 10 years from now than we have today.\n\nIf we\u2019re lucky, our health care system may even become more economical, at least one in which dramatic increases in costs that we\u2019ve gotten so used to over the past couple of decades has abated some.\n\nDavid Cutler: I am optimistic. I\u2019m hopeful they don\u2019t throw me out of the dismal society club. I am optimistic about what we can accomplish at the end of this. I started off with all these questions. At the end of this, I\u2019m comfortable that we can do much better. Whether we will or not, I don\u2019t know, but we can do much better, and that\u2019s always a good thing to feel.\n\nHarold Pollack: I should end by noting that you and I have known each other a pretty long time. I\u2019ve worked with you in a minor way on some of the things that we\u2019ve talked about today. When I see the tens of millions of people who have health insurance because of ACA, I hope that you feel good about the role that you\u2019ve played not only in the quality area, but also in getting that critical 30 percent of the legislation done so that we move closer to universal coverage. I think you should be very proud of that.\n\nDavid Cutler: As a human being, it feels great when you see stories about people who can finally get covered, who don\u2019t have to worry anymore, who have a family member who may not die as a result. You feel like you\u2019re doing something good for society. As a country, maybe we\u2019ll get to a point where we feel that we\u2019ve really done something good for society.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"People have given up on the repeal.
