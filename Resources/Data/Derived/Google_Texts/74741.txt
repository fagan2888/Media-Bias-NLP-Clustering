Prepare to get really drunk if you play the Republican Primary Debate drinking game.

Tonight is the first Republican Primary Debate of the election cycle, and it’s going to be one of the most entertaining few hours on television. The likes of Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush and so many others are descending up on Cleveland to give their first public debate in what can only be described as a wet dream come true for political fans everywhere.

If you’re a liberal, you’re excited because tonight is going to arm you with so much ammo. If you’re a conservative, you’re excited because you think this conglomerate makes up a good batch of presidential hopefuls and if you just love seeing things crash and burn then you’re going to be glued to the television for the entertainment value.

What’s a gathering of insane people without ritualistically drinking ourselves half to death in the process? After all, in the off chance that one of these window lickers actually wins the election, we’ll be one foot in the grave for our own good.

Here it is, the official Republican Primary Debate Drinking Game — good for use when any of the candidates gets up to a podium and speaks, so make sure you get good use out of it.

Take one drink if any of the following things happen:

Donald Trump talks about himself

Someone brings up God

Obamacare is brought up

Someone says Obama is doing a bad job

Benghazi is mentioned

Someone says ‘Real America’

The Iran deal is brought up negatively

Someone says ‘Personal Responsibility’

Ted Cruz tries to explain how the government works

Someone quotes Ronald Reagan

Jeb Bush says a big word with more than five letters in it

Someone flat out makes something up about Obama

Marco Rubio gets thirsty

Take two drinks if any the following happens:

Hilary Clinton’s emails are mentioned

Someone talks about the constitution but don’t know what the hell they’re talking about

Defunding Planned Parenthood comes up

Anyone brings up martial law (drink three times if its Ted Cruz)

Jeb Bush distances himself from his brother

Someone finger bangs Ronald Reagan’s memory for their own benefit

Donald Trump gets passive aggressive about Mexicans

Marco Rubio tries to act hip to appeal to the young audience not watching

Chris Christie mentions Bon Jovi or Bruce Springsteen

Someone compares themselves to Ronald Reagan

The ‘mainstream’, ‘lame stream’ or ‘liberal’ media is brought up

Someone mentions how many guns they have

Marco Rubio makes an absolutely awful analogy (Drink three times if it makes sense, which is might because you’re drunk )

The ‘free market’ is mentioned

Scott Walker says something that offends women everywhere but he has no idea

Mike Huckabee skirts anywhere near mentioning ‘militant homosexuals’

Finish your drink and crack open another one with the barrel of your revolver if this happens:

Donald Trump says something you nod your head at

Ben Carson is able to say anything during the debate

John Kasich actually shows up and is recognized

Have fun and stay safe, America.
