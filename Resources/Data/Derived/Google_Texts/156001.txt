LINCOLNVILLE, Maine — An elderly couple died late Saturday night after a fire engulfed their Lincolnville home, according to state public safety officials.

Virginia Dyer, 79, and her 81-year-old husband, Eugene Dyer, died in spite of efforts by passers-by, neighbors and emergency crews to save them, Maine Department of Public Safety spokesman Stephen McCausland confirmed Sunday afternoon.

The fire appears to have started in a storage area connected to the back of the home at 2 Virginia Drive, McCausland said. A team of fire investigators worked through the night to find the source of the fire, but has yet to confirm the cause.

Virginia Dyer’s brother, Danny Pendleton, 78, was at the scene of the fire Sunday afternoon, along with several other family members and neighbors. He said he believed the fire resulted from an electrical problem, based on an earlier conversation he had with investigators.

Pendleton said a woman from Camden passing by the home shortly before 11 p.m. Saturday night spotted the fire from the road and called 911. Pendleton said the woman was able to free the couple’s dogs from the house.

Firefighters arrived soon after and were able to get the couple out of the building and performed CPR in an effort to resuscitate them, but were unsuccessful, according to McCausland.

The flames also destroyed a truck parked in the driveway.

Pendleton said he would like to find the passer-by from Camden to thank her. He also wished to thank first responders for their efforts to save his sister and brother-in-law.

The state Medical Examiner’s Office will examine the Dyers’ bodies on Monday to determine the cause of death. More information is expected to be released Monday.
