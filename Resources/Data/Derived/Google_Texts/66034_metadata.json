With no incumbent on which to fixate, lots of competition and a litany of policy issues to discuss, the contenders have scrambled to stake out unique political ground \u2014 many on the right \u2014 with mixed results.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s surprising. We\u2019re less than a week away and I still run into multiple people every day who don\u2019t really know who\u2019s running,\u201d said Will Kendrick, the chairman of the Upson County Republican Party. \u201cPeople want somebody who\u2019s going to go in there and really get things going for the district.\u201d\n\nThe sheer number of Republican contenders virtually guarantees a runoff on July 26, so the goal for candidates Tuesday will be placing in the top two. The winner of the Republican nomination is highly favored to win the seat in November in this deep-red congressional district, which voted 2-to-1 for Mitt Romney in 2012.\n\nIf there is one unifying theme in this race, it\u2019s the same that\u2019s percolated throughout the presidential contest and many of Georgia\u2019s other congressional primaries: dissatisfaction with the status quo in Washington.\n\n+ JOHN SPINK / JSPINK@AJC.COM \u00d7\n\nBut in this economically diverse district, which stretches from Peachtree City to the northern suburbs of Columbus and north along the Alabama border, the frustration does not appear to be as uniform as it does in other parts of Georgia.\n\nTop contenders\n\nThe localized divides that exist between the Atlanta exurbs and the former textile towns in the west, for example, could be some of the biggest defining factors in the 3rd District race. And the three contenders who appear to have the most money, momentum and name recognition \u2014 Newnan-based state Sen. Mike Crane, Peachtree City businessman Jim Pace and West Point dentist Drew Ferguson \u2014 reflect those regional distinctions.\n\nUndoubtedly, the candidate with the highest name recognition is Crane.\n\nHe currently represents a portion of the 3rd District in the state Senate, where he made a name for himself as a conservative firebrand cut from the same cloth as Texas U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz. He most recently called on the Legislature to convene a special session to override Gov. Nathan Deal\u2019s veto of \u201creligious liberty\u201d legislation, and he\u2019s carved out the political ground the furthest to the right in this race.\n\n\u201cI think people are finally beginning to recognize that if one liberty can be compromised by government, then what\u2019s to stop the next one?\u201d Crane said during a recent interview in his Newnan campaign headquarters, an old Sears storefront decked out in red, white and blue. During a Thursday afternoon it was occupied by nearly a dozen volunteers calling voters while children played in a back room.\n\nThe scene reflected Crane\u2019s core constituency: socially conservative grass-roots groups and evangelicals. He\u2019s racked up endorsements from groups respected by the right such as the National Rifle Association, Georgia Right to Life and the Club for Growth, and Crane frames himself as the kind of lawmaker who would not bend on his campaign promises should he be elected to Washington.\n\n\u201cWhat differentiates me is that I\u2019m in that 10 percent (of candidates) that does exactly what they say,\u201d he said.\n\nCrane\u2019s rabble-rousing personality, however, has earned him enemies in the past. He also angered a key constituency, the law enforcement community, with comments earlier this year about no-knock warrants.\n\nCrane\u2019s fundraising has also lagged behind Pace\u2019s and Ferguson\u2019s.\n\nFerguson, in particular, surprised many when he posted the best fundraising numbers in the race, money he\u2019s funneled into building name recognition elsewhere in the district.\n\nThe charismatic former West Point mayor has used the uplifting story of his hometown\u2019s economic turnaround as a main tenet of his campaign. (Ferguson came on board as mayor in 2008, shortly after the ink had dried on a massive deal with Kia that brought thousands of jobs to the area.)\n\n\u201cWe reunited the community, we reloaded, we rebuilt, and if we can do that here at the local level \u2026. we can take those same leadership skills to Washington,\u201d Ferguson said in a recent interview a short walk from his former office in City Hall. One of his biggest challenges lies in expanding his name recognition beyond the small, 4,000-person enclave that knows him well.\n\nThat is less of a problem for Pace, a longtime resident of Peachtree City. His ties in Fayette County run deep, ones he helped bolster by bringing Pinewood Studios to the region in 2013.\n\nOn the surface, Pace appears to be cut from a similar mold as Donald Trump \u2014 a wealthy businessman and political outsider who loaned himself $250,000 to get his campaign off the ground. Pace, however, is not nearly as bombastic and lacks that same type of flair, instead quoting stories from the Bible in a recent interview.\n\nPolitical civility in Congress is a chief concern to him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a CEO for 27 years, so the business background and the experience that I have I think is a clear delineator,\u201d Pace said. \u201cI also think the biggest delineator is to hear this heart, the tone, the willingness to not polarize the situation but to try and find common ground.\u201d\n\nLike U.S. Sen. David Perdue, another political rookie with a corporate background, Pace has advocated for term limits for members of Congress.\n\nOther candidates\n\nAlso in the race is Richard Mix, a film producer and owner of a vintage toy store in Newnan who was the race\u2019s first Trump supporter. All seven GOP candidates have now vowed to back the billionaire for president.\n\nThere\u2019s also Sam Anders, a U.S. Air Force master sergeant raised in England; Chip Flanegan, a small business owner; and Arnall \u201cRod\u201d Thomas, a former educator and master gardener who mulled running as a Democrat.\n\nOn the Democratic side of the ballot, Tamarkus Cook, a Newnan pastor who also works at his family\u2019s funeral home, and Angela Pendley, a Grantville volunteer with a background in the health care field, are vying for their party\u2019s nomination.\n\nUltimately, which Republican wins a slot in a potential runoff may depend on turnout Tuesday.\n\nFor starters, awareness of the race does not appear to be high. Many other likely GOP voters say they\u2019re undecided.\n\n\u201cI would like to see someone who\u2019s first judgment when any issue comes up is not \u2018how will this affect my re-election?\u2019 That\u2019s the business they\u2019re in,\u201d said Republican Hamilton Arnall, an undecided Newnan retiree who said he was pleased overall with Westmoreland.\n\nAnn George, a teacher from LaGrange who\u2019s also undecided, said Republicans in Congress have yielded too much political ground to Democrats.\n\n\u201cWe wanted them to repeal Obamacare and all that. I feel like they\u2019ve caved into his agenda too much,\u201d she said of President Barack Obama. \u201cI want somebody that\u2019s going to stand up for us. It\u2019s our government \u2014 we elected them. It\u2019s not theirs.\u201d\n\nCoweta County GOP Chairman Brant Frost, an aide to Crane in the state Senate, said early voting numbers so far show a relatively low turnout in the district.\n\n\u201cAt the rate they\u2019re going, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you saw about 80,000 votes cast. \u2026 I would think that should favor Mike Crane because he\u2019s favored by the very active conservative voters who vote all the time,\u201d he said.\n\nFrost says the candidate who can best demonstrate he will not change his tune should he ultimately be elected has the best shot of winning in the 3rd.\n\n\u201cI think a candidate who can connect with voters, who can give the greatest assurance that he\u2019s not just blowing smoke in their face like so many others have in the past, I think that candidate will probably have a good chance of making the runoff and winning the runoff,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Seven Republicans and two Democrats on primary ballot to replace Georgia\u2019s Lynn Westmoreland.", "author": "By Tamar Hallerman - The Atlanta Journal-Constitution", "og": {"url": "http://www.myajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/open-congressional-seat-draws-crowded-field-in-pri/nrQ5D/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2016/05/20/d1/2d/primary-voting.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Seven Republicans and two Democrats on primary ballot to replace Georgia\u2019s Lynn Westmoreland.", "title": "Open seat in Congress means lots of names on ballot in Georgia"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2016/05/20/d1/2d/primary-voting.jpg", "description": "The race to win Georgia\u2019s only open congressional seat is a crowded one: seven Republican candidates and two Democrats will be on the ballot Tuesday in the 3rd District.", "card": "summary", "title": "Open congressional seat draws crowded field in primary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "myajc", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.myajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/open-congressional-seat-draws-crowded-field-in-pri/nrQ5D/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/3350820/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/open-congressional-seat-draws-crowded-field-in-pri/nrQ5D/", "keywords": "Elections,georgia news,state government,ajctopstate,politics,facebook-politics-ajc,politics_ajc,ga-government.ajc,georgia-news.ajc", "viewport": "shrink-to-fit=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Ann George, a teacher from LaGrange who\u2019s also undecided, said Republicans in Congress have yielded too much political ground to Democrats.\n\u2026 I would think that should favor Mike Crane because he\u2019s favored by the very active conservative voters who vote all the time,\u201d he said.\nNathan Deal\u2019s veto of \u201creligious liberty\u201d legislation, and he\u2019s carved out the political ground the furthest to the right in this race.\n\u201cWhat differentiates me is that I\u2019m in that 10 percent (of candidates) that does exactly what they say,\u201d he said.\nDuring a Thursday afternoon it was occupied by nearly a dozen volunteers calling voters while children played in a back room."}
