It should first be considered, however, that we have millions of people already mired in dire poverty in our inner cities, rural townships and places such as Appalachia who would certainly appreciate a helping hand before we extend one to foreigners. The same principle is seen when you board an airplane and hear the announcement, \"In case of an emergency, oxygen masks will drop from the ceiling. Put yours on first, and then administer help to those around you.\" There are many around us already in need of help.\n\nAccording to President Obama, only those five million or so illegals who have been in America for five years or more will benefit from his largesse. He indicates that they will not be eligible for health care and other benefits. Obviously, this fits right into the same category as his promise: \"If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.\"\n\nOnce illegals have legal status, it will be difficult to deny them any of the multitudinous entitlements that are freely distributed throughout our society. Also, we must remember that illegals who have been here for less than five years only have to claim that they have been here longer than that in order to collect goodies. In effect, instead of helping five million people, we probably will be aiding at least twice that many.\n\nEven this would not be a problem if we had plenty of money. The sad fact is our national debt is approaching $18 trillion. If you paid that back at a rate of $1 billion per day, it would take nearly 50 years. Many powerful nations before us have met their fate through fiscal irresponsibility. What makes our leaders think we are immune from the destructive forces of a shaky financial foundation?\n\nThe founders of our nation feared that the time would arise when an individual or group of individuals in our government would become intoxicated with their power and attempt to impose their will upon the entire society through dictatorial decrees rather than through the legal process established by our Constitution. For this reason, they established three separate but equal branches of government, dividing the powers. This ingenious method of power division worked beautifully until recently, but hopefully, we are about to experience a demonstration of how the separation of powers preserves the integrity of our system. It will require that the legislative and judicial branches of government manifest the necessary courage to stand up for the people they represent.\n\nThe American people should not be manipulated into believing that they are heartless simply because they want to preserve the rule of law in our nation and look after their own before they take in others. We also have to consider the millions of people who have immigrated here legally, as well as those who are in the queue. It is incredibly unfair to them to grant amnesty to those who have jumped ahead of them in line illegally. I hope all of our government officials will recall the words of the Pledge of Allegiance, with particular emphasis on the part that says: \"with liberty and justice for all.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Like millions of other Americans, I appreciate the plight of billions of people throughout the world who would like nothing more than to find themselves in the United States, where they could enjoy a much higher standard of living and wonderful opportunities for advancement..05/25/2016 21:31:06PM EST.", "author": "Dr. Ben Carson", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Like millions of other Americans, I appreciate the plight of billions of people throughout the world who would like nothing more than to find themselves in the United States, where they could enjoy a much higher standard of living and wonderful opportunities for advancement.", "title": "Dr. Ben Carson - Illegal Executive Orders Reward Illegal Immigration", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/drbencarson/2014/11/26/illegal-executive-orders-reward-illegal-immigration-n1923959", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2012/341/2012-12-06T163727Z_1_CBRE8B51A7800_RTROPTP_3_GREECE-IMMIGRANTS-RIGHTS.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Like millions of other Americans, I appreciate the plight of billions of people throughout the world who would like nothing more than to find themselves in the United States, where they could enjoy a much higher standard of living and wonderful opportunities for advancement.", "title": "Dr. Ben Carson - Illegal Executive Orders Reward Illegal Immigration", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/drbencarson/2014/11/26/illegal-executive-orders-reward-illegal-immigration-n1923959", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2012/341/2012-12-06T163727Z_1_CBRE8B51A7800_RTROPTP_3_GREECE-IMMIGRANTS-RIGHTS.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Illegal Executive Orders Reward Illegal Immigration, Dr. Ben Carson, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1715\"", "article_summary": "It certainly seems like a compassionate thing to offer them legal status in America and the opportunity to pursue their dreams.\nOnce illegals have legal status, it will be difficult to deny them any of the multitudinous entitlements that are freely distributed throughout our society.\nIn effect, instead of helping five million people, we probably will be aiding at least twice that many.\nIt is incredibly unfair to them to grant amnesty to those who have jumped ahead of them in line illegally.\nWe also have to consider the millions of people who have immigrated here legally, as well as those who are in the queue."}
