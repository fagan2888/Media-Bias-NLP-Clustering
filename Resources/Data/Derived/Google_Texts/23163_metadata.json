It was very scary,\u201d Mirabal said.\n\nSoon, doctors told the couple their boys would have a good chance of surviving separation surgery; Connor and Carter shared organs that can be separated.\n\nThe boys shared a liver, bile ducts and part of their small intestine. If they shared a heart or brain, fewer options were available, said Dr. Daniel Robie, chief of pediatric general surgery for Nemours Children\u2019s Specialty Care at Wolfson Children\u2019s Hospital in Jacksonville.\n\n\u201cWe separate them and then reconstruct them so that they each have organs that are going to function normally,\u201d Robie said.\n\nStill, there were obstacles. The doctors worried about too much blood loss while separating the liver, Robie said.\n\nSo the surgeons and their teams spent months preparing. They went through dry runs and created medical illustrations of the conjoined areas for study.\n\nThe twins were in critical but stable condition Monday, according to the hospital. They\u2019ll be in the hospital for at least another month.\n\nWeary but in good spirits, Brantley and Mirabal say they\u2019re starting to think about all the routine things new parents do. They say the ordeal brought them closer together and they are now engaged to be married.\n\n\u201cWe are starting to change around the house, getting cribs set up,\u201d said Mirabal, 26, who works as a house painter. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t started setting anything up because of what we were told could happen (in surgery).\u201d\n\nBrantley said they are going to celebrate birthdays and have a party each year to honor the date of the boys\u2019 separation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m keeping some of the conjoined clothes people have made them so I can show it to them when they\u2019re older,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "For the first time in their 5-month-old lives, conjoined twins Carter and Conner squirmed in separate cribs.
