However, they can sign up for Medicaid 30 days before they are released so they will be covered when they get out.\n\nOklahoma is among 20 states that have not expanded their Medicaid programs under the new federal health care law. Expansion would add coverage options to low-income adults in addition to disabled Oklahoma residents, including those who are blind and deaf.\n\nBut state officials claim Oklahoma could not afford the expansion regardless of how much money the federal government provided.\n\nThe state Corrections Department spent $84.7 million on inmate medical costs last year and data suggests that a large percentage of offenders enter the prison system sick, injured or otherwise unhealthy after years of hard living and poor lifestyle choices.\n\nAn aging prison population is also a problem for Oklahoma\u2019s prison system. More than 5,000 of Oklahoma\u2019s prison inmates are at least 50 years old, Corrections Department data indicates.\n\nIn 2014, the agency spent $84.4 million on inmate health care costs. Expenses had remained relatively stagnant during the previous decade, ranging from $60 million to $71 million from 2005 through 2013.\n\nThe Oklahoma Health Care Authority, which administers Medicaid in the state, does not have an agreement with the Corrections Department in which applications can be filled out early pending an inmate\u2019s release, said Jennie Melendez, spokeswoman for the Health Care Authority.\n\n\u201cFor most cases, we do have real-time enrollment, so there is not a lag time when a potential member applies online,\u201d Melendez said. \u201cWe have been ahead of other states in this regard.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Oklahoman, http://www.newsok.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Oklahoma does not participate in a program that allows soon-to-be-released inmates to sign up for Medicaid health insurance before release.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/28/oklahoma-not-participating-in-prison-inmate-medica/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Oklahoma does not participate in a program that allows soon-to-be-released inmates to sign up for Medicaid health insurance before release.", "title": "Oklahoma not participating in prison inmate Medicaid program"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "Oklahoma does not participate in a program that allows soon-to-be-released inmates to sign up for Medicaid health insurance before release.", "card": "summary", "title": "Oklahoma not participating in prison inmate Medicaid program"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - Oklahoma does not participate in a program that allows soon-to-be-released inmates to sign up for Medicaid health insurance before release.\nOklahoma is among 20 states that have not expanded their Medicaid programs under the new federal health care law.\nUnder federal rules, inmates cannot access federal health care benefits while they are incarcerated.\nMore than 5,000 of Oklahoma\u2019s prison inmates are at least 50 years old, Corrections Department data indicates.\nIn 2014, the agency spent $84.4 million on inmate health care costs."}
