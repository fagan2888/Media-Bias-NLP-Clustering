Jon Voight — Academy Award-winning actor, outspoken republican and father of Angelina Jolie — issued a call to arms Sunday on YouTube, urging people to realize that President Obama does not love Israel.

In the video, Voight declares his support for Israel and its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu right out of the gate. Opening the video he says: “I love Israel. I want to see Israel survive and not be overtaken by the mad men of this world.”

“President Obama does not love Israel,” he continued. “His whole agenda is to control Israel. And this way he can be friends with all of Israel’s enemies. America has not been the same since his presidency.”
