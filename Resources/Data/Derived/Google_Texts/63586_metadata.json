Polling in mid-October showed Obama holding an 85 percent approval rating among blacks, compared to 34 percent with whites. He won 93 percent of the black vote in 2012, down from 95 percent in 2008; though clearly his popularity with this core group has suffered, African-Americans still support him by a wide margin.\n\nHis first campaign event of this election cycle was on October 19, just two weeks before Election Day. He stumped in Illinois, trying to rally black support for incumbent Governor Quinn, and in Maryland for Lt. Governor Anthony Brown, running to be the state\u2019s first African-American governor. In both states he addressed largely black audiences, looking to boost participation by a group that historically is under-represented in midterm races.\n\nRelated: Why Millennials (Shocker!) Now Prefer a GOP Congress\n\nThen there he was on Al Sharpton\u2019s radio station, promising that he \u201cwill be responsible for making sure that our voters turn out.\u201d Our voters? Then Obama was on Rickey Smiley\u2019s radio hour, lamenting, \"I'll bet there are whole bunch of folks listening to your show who may not even know that there's an election going on. I need everybody to go vote.\" The Crist campaign quietly ran a new radio spot yesterday in Florida targeting black voters, featuring the president, as did Kay Hagan in North Carolina.\n\nWhat a sad comedown for our first African American president \u2013 a man who promised to bring the country together, and who was expected to be the first post-racial leader. As an editorial in the LA Times gushed in 2008, \u201cDoes his victory mean that America is now officially beyond racism?\u201d It asked, \u201cCan the good Revs. Jackson and Sharpton now safely retire to the seashore?\u201d\n\nMore poignantly, the editorial asks, \u201cWon't an Obama presidency at last lead us across a centuries-old gulf of alienation into the recognition that America really is our country? Might this milestone not infuse black America with a new American nationalism?\u201d Remember those days?\n\n\n\nSadly, the divisions in the country appear as sharp as ever \u2013 or even sharper. Among blacks, according to a recent Rasmussen survey, 87 percent think that those who oppose President Obama do so because of racism. In contrast, more than two-thirds of whites and well over half of other minorities think that policy differences account for opposition to the president. Almost one third of the electorate considers racism Obama\u2019s big stumbling block. Astonishingly, that\u2019s up from 18 percent in 2011. Under President Obama, we have indeed been traveling in the wrong direction.\n\nRelated: While Obama Skulks Around, Hillary Rides a Wave of Popularity\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that the black vote remains key for Democrats, especially as President Obama\u2019s popularity has taken a bigger hit with other segments of the coalition that elected him in 2008 and 2012. Millennials and Hispanics still support the president, but with markedly less enthusiasm than in earlier elections. No group tilts so strongly for Democrats than blacks and no group was courted so heavily in recent weeks.\n\nPollster Cornell Belcher wrote in a confidential memo published by The New York Times, \"African-American surge voters came out in force in 2008 and 2012, but they are not well positioned to do so again in 2014.\" He added ominously, \"In fact, over half aren't even sure when the midterm elections are taking place.\" Belcher prophesied that weak turnout among blacks would result in \u201ccrushing Democratic losses across the country.\u201d\n\nSome black voices have pointed out the uncomfortable truth that African-Americans have not prospered under President Obama. Alveda King, niece of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and thorn in the side of Al Sharpton, points out on her website Restore the Dream 2014 that unemployment among blacks is 11.5 percent compared to 5.9 percent for the country overall. She adds that the poverty rate among blacks has increased from 12 percent in 2008 to 16.1 percent under President Obama.\n\nKing also cites the lamentable fact that only 52 percent of black males graduate high school and that blacks earn on average $21,000 less than the national average. King is a pro-life activist who says that if the African American community was better educated on the issues, they might not be such reliable Democrat voters.\n\nRelated: Democrats Just Lost the Phony War on Women\n\nTrue or not, it is discouraging to see that blacks are driven more by racial issues than by policy considerations. Nearly four in five Americans think that politicians play the \u201crace card\u201d simply to get votes. Only 9 percent think that politicians raise racial issues to address \u201creal problems\u201d according to Rasmussen. While only 41 percent of all voters say that race is at least somewhat important to their vote, nearly 80 percent of blacks say it is important. That surely does not sound like progress.\n\nIt\u2019s not only President Obama who has been playing the \u201crace card.\u201d Michelle Nunn, who ran for the Senate in Georgia, has refused to condemn ads run on her behalf by the Democratic operatives in her state. One evokes the emotional recent events in Ferguson, showing two children holding \u201cDon\u2019t Shoot\u201d signs, which say, \u201cIf you want to prevent another Ferguson in their future\u2026vote. It\u2019s up to you to make change happen.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Dismal Performance Is His Personal Failure\n\nMary Landrieu, Senator from Louisiana, in a tight race to keep her seat, also pitched race, saying to NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd, \u201cTo be very, very honest with you, the South has not always been the friendliest place for African-Americans.\u201d She went on, \u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult time for the president to present himself in a very positive light as a leader.\u201d\n\nImagine. President Obama has not failed because he saddled a fragile economy with a huge, complicated healthcare bill that stalled hiring, added to the country\u2019s uncertainty, and remains unpopular to this day. He hasn\u2019t failed because he was woefully na\u00efve about foreign policy or because he surrounded himself with ideologically sympathetic apparatchiks with little capability, and has managed the government poorly. He has failed because the country that elected him twice is racist.\n\nThe saddest pitch comes from a flier distributed in Georgia that pleads with black voters: \u201cIt\u2019s up to us to vote to protect President Obama and his legacy as the first African-American president\u2026. His name isn\u2019t on the ballot. But his presidency is on the line.\u201d\n\nYes, it is. And race has nothing to do with it.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "At the end, President Obama campaigned almost exclusively to turn out black voters.", "title": "Obama and the Dems\u2019 Racial Politics\u2014a Desperate Election Play", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/11/05/Obama-and-Dems-Racial-Politics-Desperate-Election-Play", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/07172014_Obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/11/05/Obama-and-Dems-Racial-Politics-Desperate-Election-Play", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/07172014_Obama.jpg", "creator": "@lizpeek", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "At the end, President Obama campaigned almost exclusively to turn out black voters.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe31dc\"", "article_summary": "At the end, President Obama campaigned almost exclusively to turn out black voters.\nUnder President Obama, we have indeed been traveling in the wrong direction.\nShe adds that the poverty rate among blacks has increased from 12 percent in 2008 to 16.1 percent under President Obama.\nAmong blacks, according to a recent Rasmussen survey, 87 percent think that those who oppose President Obama do so because of racism.\nPresident Obama has not failed because he saddled a fragile economy with a huge, complicated healthcare bill that stalled hiring, added to the country\u2019s uncertainty, and remains unpopular to this day."}
