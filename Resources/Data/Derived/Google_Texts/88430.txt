MSNBC’s Morning Joe panel roundly criticized Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s (D., Nev.) remarks that the Koch brothers were “un-American” and Republicans “were addicted to Koch” Thursday.

Reid, fighting for the Senate Democrats to keep their majority, has made the billionaire philanthropists a frequent target of his barbed tongue on the Senate floor, in pro-Democratic ad campaigns and on Twitter. He’s raged against their wealth and contributions to Republicans while simultaneously attending a fundraiser at the home of liberal billionaire Tom Steyer.

“You do understand in 2008 and 2012, Barack Obama received more big money from Wall Street than any candidate in the history of American politics,” said host Joe Scarborough. “You understand that it’s a misleading ad campaign, and to call them un-American is despicable. To say Republicans are addicted to Koch is despicable.”

Co-host Willie Geist called the remarks “a little beneath the office,” and Scarborough added Reid’s screeds were the definition of McCarthyism. Even contributor Harold Ford, a former Democratic congressman, said it was out of line.

“There’s no need for that kind of vitriol,” he said.

“To call then un-American is incorrect,” said liberal contributor Donny Deutsch.

Reid also raised eyebrows on both sides of the aisle when he said all the “horror stories” about Obamacare around the country were lies.
