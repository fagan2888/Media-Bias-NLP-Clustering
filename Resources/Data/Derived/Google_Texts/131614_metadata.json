And my co-worker was like \u2018This is $50,000.\u2019 I was like 'oh, wow!'\u201d she said.\n\nImmediately, she knew what she wanted to do with it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had my heart set to donate,\u201d Bui said. \u201cI always read about these charities and I always want to be able to help.\u201d\n\nAnd now, she can.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a God send,\u201d said Tom Brown, president of the Lawton Humane Society.\n\nBui is donating some of her winnings to the Lawton Humane Society.\n\nBrown said they are currently struggling to help all the abandoned animals, many which require veterinary care.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say we\u2019re broke, but we are in the red and it\u2019s medical expenses,\u201d Brown said.\n\nBui, a veteran, is also donating to Mission 22, an organization that uses jiu-jitsu to end veteran and soldier suicide.\n\n\u201cNow, it\u2019s time to do something to take care of the veterans and soldiers and give them a good, stable environment where they can call or come and talk and come train,\u201d said Virgil Allen, who has benefited from the service.\n\nBui doesn't want News 9 to say exactly how much she's donating but it's a large portion of her winnings. She only wanted to share her story to encourage others to do the same.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that I can inspire other people to go out and donate some of their time or some of their money if they can to these organizations,\u201d she said.\n\nBui is also donating to the Bully Breed Humane Society .\n\nClick here for more information about the Lawton Humane Society .", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Instead of keeping it all for herself, she is donating it to several charities all around Lawton.", "author": "Dana Hertneky", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/31014173/lawton-woman-donates-50k-powerball-winnings-to-charities", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9690812_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Instead of keeping it all for herself, she is donating it to several charities all around Lawton.", "title": "Lawton Woman Donates Powerball Winnings To Charity"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9690812_G.jpg", "description": "Instead of keeping it all for herself, she is donating it to several charities all around Lawton.", "card": "summary", "title": "Lawton Woman Donates Powerball Winnings To Charity"}, "wnreadableurl": "lawton-woman-donates-50k-powerball-winnings-to-charities", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2016/01/20", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv, Powerball, Lottery, winnings", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS24", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv, Powerball, Lottery, winnings"}, "article_summary": "Click here for more information about the Lawton Humane Society .\n\u201cIt\u2019s a God send,\u201d said Tom Brown, president of the Lawton Humane Society.\nBui is donating some of her winnings to the Lawton Humane Society.\nBui doesn't want News 9 to say exactly how much she's donating but it's a large portion of her winnings.\nShe didn't get the $1 billion but an Oklahoma woman did win big during last week's record Powerball drawing."}
