The first lady and Peng Liyuan will visit the Panda House on Friday to “commemorate over four decades of scientific collaboration between the United States and China around giant panda conservation,” according to the White House.

Peng is accompanying her husband, Chinese President Xi Jinping, on their first state visit to Washington this week.

The zoo was the site of the birth of a pair of panda twins last month, born to Mei Xiang. One of the cubs died four days after it was born. The surviving cub, who has not yet been named, is “doing very well,” zoo officials said last week.

Getting a sneak peek at the pandas appears to be a first family perk. While the National Zoo’s “Giant Panda Cam” offers 24/7 access to images of the newest panda family member, the Panda House exhibit is closed to the public until the cub is about four months old.
