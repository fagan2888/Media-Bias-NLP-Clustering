Let\u2019s take a look back at some of the more perplexing recipes that the network has suggested we make room for on the holiday table.\n\n1. Pumpkin Pie Smoothie\n\nEver reach the point when you are so strung out on tryptophan that you don\u2019t have the energy required to lift a forkful of pie to your mouth? No fear \u2014 Ree Drummond (aka \u201cThe Pioneer Woman\u201d) has the perfect solution. Just toss the pie in a blender with milk and yogurt and pulse until it can be sucked through a straw.\n\n2. Turkey and Cranberry Ravioli\n\nI\u2019m all for fusion cuisine, but I never thought I\u2019d hear the instructions: \u201cDrain the ravioli into the gravy and stir to coat.\u201d Giada\u2019s take on the holiday meal seems more like the day after the day after Thanksgiving when you make a sad grab for whatever leftovers are still good and combine them with the pre-Turkey Day remnants stashed in the back in the fridge. It tastes fine, but then you decide to stop kidding yourself and smother it all with gravy because you know you\u2019ve already sized out of your jeans and there\u2019s no way to stop the cycle now. In short, Giada\u2019s Turkey and Cranberry Ravioli recipe is self-loathing on a plate. To make it even more depressing, this is for her special \u201cThanksgiving for Two\u201d episode; but I suppose that just means there\u2019s more gravy to go around.\n\n3. Marbled Mashed Sweet Potatoes\n\nFor the holiday table that could use a little tye-dyed flair, simply take two of the most common potato side dishes \u2014 mashed and sweet \u2014 and swirl them in a bowl. The result is simultaneously noncommittal and underwhelming (just what your parents say about your partner, right?) and it\u2019s the antithesis of Bobby\u2019s labor-intensive potatoes below.\n\n4. Grilled Hassleback Sweet Potatoes with Molasses-Nutmeg Butter\n\nNow, don\u2019t get me wrong. These potatoes look beautiful, and they taste delicious as well, but only Bobby Flay would suggest a sweet potato side dish that has to be boiled, charcoal grilled and flamb\u00e9 finished, all wrapped with the suggestion to \u201cserve immediately,\u201d as if sweet potatoes are your only holiday meal responsibility.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, though. If you spend too much time ensuring that you don\u2019t singe the potatoes (and your eyebrows) and end up turkey-less, Food Network Magazine has you covered. One of their tips for decor includes a $12 inflatable bird complete with this calming sentiment: \u201cNo matter how your Thanksgiving dinner turns out, you\u2019re guaranteed to get \u2018oohs\u2019 and \u2018aahs\u2019 when you walk out of the kitchen with this 16-inch, golden inflatable turkey. Everyone can have a laugh \u2014 and play toss with the imposter \u2014 while you [hopefully] carve the real thing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Never accept a Thanksgiving invitation from a chef who serves cheese soup, liquid pie or a \"Turketta\"", "title": "Crimes against Thanksgiving: The Food Network\u2019s 10 biggest holiday atrocities", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Never accept a Thanksgiving invitation from a chef who serves cheese soup, liquid pie or a \"Turketta\"", "title": "Crimes against Thanksgiving: The Food Network\u2019s 10 biggest holiday atrocities", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/26/crimes_against_thanksgiving_the_food_networks_10_biggest_holiday_atrocities/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/guy_fieri2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Never accept a Thanksgiving invitation from a chef who serves cheese soup, liquid pie or a \"Turketta\"", "title": "Crimes against Thanksgiving: The Food Network\u2019s 10 biggest holiday atrocities", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/guy_fieri2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Ashlie D.
