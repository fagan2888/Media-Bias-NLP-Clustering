SUFFIELD, Conn.â€”A New Jersey boy has died two days after he was pulled from the swimming school of an independent secondary school in Connecticut.

Suffield Academy Headmaster Charlie Cahn said on Saturday that 14-year-old Iheanyichukwu Anyanwu was from Irvingston, N.J. The ninth grader died Friday at Baystate Medical Center in the western Massachusetts city of Springfield.

Cahn says the boy, of Nigerian descent, was in the pool very briefly but needed to be rescued. An athletic trainer who was also on the pool deck immediately performed CPR. Paramedics who responded to the scene delivered emergency care and took the boy to hospital.

Cahn says the community is in shock and devastated "at the loss of this exceptional young man." The school is trying to figure out what circumstances might have led to the tragedy.
