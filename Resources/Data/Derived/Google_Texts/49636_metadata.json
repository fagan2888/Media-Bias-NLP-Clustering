Determined to remain agile and connected to a fit and fun lifestyle, they\u2019ve made bocce ball one of their favorite activities.\n\nThe group meets Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 9:30 am to approximately 11 am, playing indoors and outdoors.\n\nMarcy Young, 83, an Arbor Glen resident for 12 years, said that the activity originated on 28-acre campus of the facility in the fall of 2006 when resident Ed Malone, who passed away a year ago, was practicing his golf swings on a grassy area in front of the campus gazebo.\n\n\u201cHe thought it would be a good place to have bocce ball games,\u201d she said.\n\nThe number of players advanced from four to eight to the current steady crop of 12 residents, according to Young. She said that they use Malone\u2019s bocce ball set, as well as one that was purchased in May 2007.\n\nAt the beginning of 2009, a gravel court was installed because the number of players was growing.\n\nIn the spring of 2010, Don Pruess, 76, who has been an Arbor Glen resident for five years, began to take over duties of preparing the playing area for his fellow seniors, setting up the court and freeing it of leaves, keeping it smoothed out, free of rake marks and rolled it out when fresh gravel was added.\n\nHe also acquired three benches for players\u2019 seating as well as a storage bin for bocce ball supplies.\n\nAlthough diabetes has limited him as he advances in age, Pruess shared that he hopes to keep committed to his responsibilities which were originally held by Malone. When not enjoying bocce ball, Pruess attends various meetings on campus about activities and operations at Arbor Glen.\n\nYoung recalled how, as the bocce ball group was beginning to flourish, resident Al Polizzi, who lived to be 100 before dying in May of 2010, lent his expertise and enthusiasm to the game.\n\n\u201cHe was a sweet man. I\u2019m told he had a barbershop for at least 50 years in Westfield,\u201d said Young of Polizzi, who was often known to don a soft brownish tan beret-type cap with brown tweed sports jacket.\n\nBuy Photo A participant picks up her balls as residents of Arbor Glen in Bridgewater play bocce.

I\u2019m not sure how he did it, but he maneuvered beautifully with his cane \u2013 out to the court and over the side board into the court to toss the ball, still supported by the cane,\u201d reported Young.\n\n\u201cHe was quite a character, we loved him,\u201d she said, adding that the bocce group has, over the years, built a strong sense of camaraderie among its members.\n\n\u201cBocce ball has even become part of our exercise program,\u201d she added, with many of the bocce ball moves used to help the residents in our entire community.\u201d\n\nFreddie Oakley, 85, a seven-year resident of Arbor Glen, said that bocce ball has captured the interest of many of the seniors who prefer to play indoors instead of outdoors due to inclement weather.\n\n\u201cWe bought an indoor bocce ball set and sometimes we have more players than we can handle,\u201d chuckled Oakley, adding that the seniors catch sight of the bocce ball games on their way to the dining room or auditorium and are eager to join in.\n\nPVC pipe and brightly-colored ribbon have added to the construction of the indoor setting with two temporary indoor courts to make for an equally entertaining backdrop for the seniors\u2019 favorite game.\n\nBuy Photo Residents of Arbor Glen in Bridgewater play bocce three times a week. (Photo: Kathy Johnson, Kathy Johnson/Staff Photographer)\n\n\u201cWe have lots of laughs,\u201d said Oakley when asked about what sets the activity apart from the various others offered at Arbor Glen. When not playing bocce ball, she can often be found enjoying a game of bridge.\n\nAccording to Young, Arbor Glen residents do not employ a formal social director; rather, activities are generated and executed by residents, even those off-campus day trips and arts and entertainment programs.\n\n\u201cBocce ball keeps us moving and keeps us social,\u201d added Young, who also takes continuing education classes at Rutgers University and Raritan Valley Community College. \u201cWhile we haven\u2019t competed in any tournaments we are competitive but gather really just for fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to move your whole body for bocce ball and have to pick up the balls,\u201d added Pruess.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t pick up the balls, you shouldn\u2019t be playing,\u201d advised Young, who helps recruit new members to the group as they become residents of Arbor Glen.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t use it, you lose it,\u201d she concluded.\n\nAbout Arbor Glen\n\nArbon Glen is a Friends organization, founded in Somerset County in 1990 as a CCRC (continuing care retirement community) committed to the expression of Quaker regard for dignity, equality and ethical business practices.
