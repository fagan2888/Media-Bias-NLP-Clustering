The meetings have included advocates from more than two dozen organizations, firms and industry groups, according to an analysis of records by The Hill.\n\nHeavy hitters such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; the Financial Services Roundtable; the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association; the Investment Company Institute; the American Council of Life Insurers (ACLI); and the Spark Institute, an industry group for the retirement plan industry, have all attended White House meetings the last two months.\n\n\u201cThis is a topic of interest to virtually everyone in the [financial services] industry,\u201d said Michael Hadley, a partner at Davis & Harman, who has been in recent meetings. \u201cIt seemed like [officials] were genuinely interested in the points we made.\u201d\n\nThe Save Our Retirement Coalition has also aired its views to the administration. The coalition includes public interest and watchdog organizations supportive of the Labor Department\u2019s efforts, including the AARP, Better Markets, Consumers Union, the Main Street Alliance and the Center for American Progress\n\n\u201cFrom a process perspective, the rule has been in the making now for six years; there\u2019s been a ton of back and forth,\u201d said David Certner, the legislative counsel and legislative policy director for government affairs at the AARP.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m expecting them \u2026 to be open to changes in a number of areas to make the rule work better,\u201d Certner said. \u201cBut we were generally pleased with the framework they had.\u201d\n\nIn the meetings, organized by the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), administration officials hold the details of the regulation being reviewed close to the vest. Generally, they listen to the presentations and only ask questions when they need a point clarified.\n\nProponents of the fiduciary proposal such as President Obama and Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth WarrenClinton urged to go liberal with vice presidential pick The Trail 2016: Hell breaks loose Minority lawmakers bash Trump over housing crisis MORE (D-Mass.) say it is needed to protect individuals from unscrupulous retirement advisers who generate large profits for themselves at the expense of workers and retirees.\n\nAlthough many of the opposing groups agree with the intent of the rule, the financial services industry has said that the 121-page proposal would ultimately hurt the investors it aims to protect, largely by making retirement advice more expensive and harder to obtain.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce is among the fiercest critics of the rule and has vowed to use any method at its disposal to fight it, including litigation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had very strong conversations with people in the Labor Department and in the White House [about] what has to happen to that rule for it to be acceptable and not destructive to the retirement system of small companies and others,\u201d Thomas Donohue, the Chamber\u2019s president and CEO, told reporters in January.\n\nThe business giant has had three meetings at the White House since 2015, according to records. It has said that the Labor Department, which has also faced criticism from the Securities and Exchange Commission for its proposal, did not conduct an adequate analysis of costs and benefits.\n\n\u201cIf [the finalized rule] looks appropriate, we won\u2019t have to sue,\u201d Donohue said. \u201cIf it\u2019s not appropriate, it\u2019s not just suing; we now have, in the Senate and in the House, much better systems to use the appropriations and other parts of the committee process to work on this deal, and we will.\u201d\n\nThe ACLI, which represents life insurance businesses, also pointed to legislative fixes when asking regulators to make changes.\n\nAspects of two pieces of legislation introduced on Capitol Hill \u2014 the Affordable Retirement Advice Protection Act and the Strengthening Access to Valuable Education and Retirement Support Act \u2014 should act as a \u201cNorth Star\u201d as the White House and the Labor Department finalize the rule, said ACLI spokesman Jack Dolan.\n\nThe bills, which have gained some bipartisan support, should be \u201ca guide to follow so that a regulation that would be in the best interest of all Americans can be issued,\u201d he said.\n\nThe two bills would create new standards for investment advisers, allowing them to sell proprietary products as long as that is disclosed to clients. Language included in both bills says advisers would have to disclose that \u201cthe same or similar investments may be available at a different costs (greater or lesser) from other sources.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday morning, additional meetings from last week appeared on OIRA's public disclosure portal. Five meetings were held on Thursday and Friday alone -- with representatives from the National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors, the Public Investors Arbitration Bar Association, the Alternative & Direct Investment Securities Association, the American Benefits Council and a company called Betterment all having face time with the White House.\n\nThe final version of the rule landed at the White House on Jan. 28, 2016. While OIRA has 90 days to review it and send it back to the Labor Department \u2014 either with or without demanding alterations \u2014 many say that the process will likely be expedited. Multiple sources told The Hill that Friday's meetings with OIRA were the last it was having on the matter.\n\nPeter Schroeder contributed to this report.\n\n-- This post was updated at 9:41 a.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Lobbyists for business and public interest groups are flocking to the White House.", "description": "Lobbyists for business and public interest groups are flocking to the White House.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Megan R.
