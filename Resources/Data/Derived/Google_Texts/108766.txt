The simultaneous roar of eight monster trucks was music to the ears for those in attendance Friday night for the opening of Monster Jam. The noxious fumes of engine exhaust that lingered in the air at Kentucky Exposition Center Freedom Hall were as sweet as the scent of honeysuckle to the frenzied monster truck fan experiencing full-sensory overload.

Featuring monster trucks, monster speedsters, and monster ATVs, the seven competitive "disciplines" test a driver's ability to maneuver jumps, perform wheelies and donuts, and maintain high speeds along a dirt course with a multi-ramped center. Points are awarded by a panel of judges based on a driver's execution and ability to complete certain challenges.

The Monster Jam athletes were contending for placement in the Monster Jam World Finals this March in Las Vegas and the line-up included legendary vehicles like Grave Digger, Scooby-Doo and El Toro Loco. Dubbed an "endurance showdown" the drivers have very little time between events and perform both individual challenges and head-to-head combative racing.
