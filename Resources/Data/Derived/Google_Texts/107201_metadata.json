(AP) - Shavon Shields will follow Nebraska\u2019s concussion protocol after banging his head on the court in a hard fall during a game against Rutgers on Saturday.\n\nThe athletic department said in a statement that Shields was released from a Lincoln hospital after a CT scan was negative.\n\nHe was alert and able to move his arms and legs when he was taken out of Pinnacle Bank Arena in the second half. He briefly lost consciousness.\n\nShields\u2019 mother, Senia Shields, rushed to his side as medics tended to him in front of a silent crowd of 12,981. He received a standing ovation as he was wheeled out of the arena on a backboard.\n\n\u201cWe are relieved and thankful Shavon has been released, and that his injuries aren\u2019t more serious,\u201d coach Tim Miles said. \u201cWe will follow the proper protocol to get him back to full speed. I know Shavon and his family are grateful for everyone\u2019s thoughts and prayers.\u201d\n\nShields was hurt when Rutgers\u2019 D.J. Foreman started to go up for a shot under the basket with 8:49 left. Shields, approaching Foreman from behind, flipped over Foreman\u2019s back. He landed on his left shoulder and smacked his head on the floor.\n\nMiles said Shields was knocked out for about a minute.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t recall anything that had happened,\u201d Miles said.\n\nShields\u2019 teammates took to Twitter after the game in support.\n\n\u201cMost basketball players go through a fall like that. It\u2019s a matter of how serious it is when you land,\u201d Andrew White III said. \u201cYou can hit your back, neck, head. He was doing his job and that\u2019s the risk of it. Very scary moment.\u201d\n\nShields, a senior from Olathe, Kansas, is the son of 2015 Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee Will Shields. He scored 17 points in the 87-63 win over Rutgers and is the Huskers\u2019 second-leading scorer this season. He has started 106 consecutive games.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Shavon Shields will follow Nebraska's concussion protocol after banging his head on the court in a hard fall during a game against Rutgers on Saturday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Shavon Shields will follow Nebraska\u2019s concussion protocol after banging his head on the court in a hard fall during a game against Rutgers on Saturday.", "title": "Huskers\u2019 Shields hits head, will follow concussion protocol", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/6/nebraskas-shavon-shields-bangs-head-in-hard-fall/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/02/06/aptopix_rutgers_nebraska_basketball.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/02/06/aptopix_rutgers_nebraska_basketball.jpeg", "description": "Shavon Shields will follow Nebraska's concussion protocol after banging his head on the court in a hard fall during a game against Rutgers on Saturday.", "card": "summary", "title": "Huskers\u2019 Shields hits head, will follow concussion protocol"}, "Author": "ERIC OLSON", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccde9\"", "article_summary": "(AP) - Shavon Shields will follow Nebraska\u2019s concussion protocol after banging his head on the court in a hard fall during a game against Rutgers on Saturday.\nShields\u2019 mother, Senia Shields, rushed to his side as medics tended to him in front of a silent crowd of 12,981.\nThe athletic department said in a statement that Shields was released from a Lincoln hospital after a CT scan was negative.\n\u201cWe are relieved and thankful Shavon has been released, and that his injuries aren\u2019t more serious,\u201d coach Tim Miles said.\nVery scary moment.\u201dShields, a senior from Olathe, Kansas, is the son of 2015 Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee Will Shields."}
