By 2015, 30 percent of Californians will be enrolled, about 11.5 million people.\n\nGovernor Brown\u2019s budget added $1.2 billion to account for the increase, giving a total $2.4 billion to Medi-Cal users. While some lawmakers are critical of the budget increase, within the medical community, there is only alarm that it\u2019s not quite enough.\n\nThe California Medical Association has said that retaining 10 percent provider cuts will carry consequences for low-income patients.\n\nHow will Californians enrolled in Medi-Cal find doctors who take their insurance?
