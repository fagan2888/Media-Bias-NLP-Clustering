Google either opted not to buy Twitch, or got outbid by Amazon, which this week agreed to acquire the live video game-streaming site for close to $1 billion. But can’t Google simply roll out a Twitch copycat on YouTube? It won’t be easy, say gaming experts.

YouTube would seem to have plenty of built-in advantages that would make it relatively easy for the site to build a big audience for live video game streaming. For one thing, YouTube boasts one billion monthly users. The site is also highly social in nature.

Plus, according to the analytics firm OpenSlate, 23% of the ad-supported content on YouTube is related to gaming, and there is a plethora of recorded video game play on the site. Just look at the biggest YouTube channel, PewDiePie, which features the Swedish creator Felix Kjellberg playing and commenting on video games for over 30 million subscribers.

Still, even if it wanted to, YouTube couldn’t just flip a switch and start its own Twitch. One big hurdle is that it specializes in on-demand videos, while Twitch is known for live streaming. YouTube has tried its hand at building out a live viewing experience,

“Google has tried for a few years,” said Peer Schneider, co-founder of the gaming reviews site IGN. “YouTube is live streaming enabled. But for gamers to use it, it’s not trivial easy or turnkey like Twitch.”

Google declined to comment.

As Mr. Schneider explained, because Twitch is an application that is often weaved seamlessly into the interfaces of gaming platforms, it’s easy for gamers to record what they are playing, share it with others live, and invite viewers to chime in. That’s all technically possible with YouTube, but it’s more complicated and “not everybody has that knowledge about how to do all that,” he said.

YouTube right now acts as sort of the on-demand version of Twitch for video game enthusiasts. Mr. Schneider pointed to the reams of instructional game videos on the site, often grouped under the label “Let’s Play.”

YouTube had looked to court live video game players a few years ago, said Machinima CEO Chad Gutstein. “We were very involved,” he said. But since Mr. Gutstein took the reigns of the video game-centric programmer last March, live content on YouTube “is not something I’ve spent much time on.”

Why might YouTube be less focused on live gaming? Well, because right now Google is focused on bigger fish, namely trying to convince big advertisers to shift TV ad budgets to Web video.

“It’s just not a focus for them,” said Sundance DiGiovanni, co-founder and CEO of the professional video game organization Major League Gaming. “I think Google and YouTube are focused on businesses of scale. There’s not really an opportunity to form a new gaming platform within this giant platform.”

“Had they really put time into it they could have competed [with Twitch] but it never seemed like a priority,” Mr. DiGiovanni added.

Mr. DiGiovanni says YouTube’s huge size is an issue — a Twitch-competitor might get lost among its many channels and millions of video streams.

“What has worked with Twitch is that it’s dedicated to a single purpose,” said David Gibbons, Vice President of Marketing at Ustream, another live streaming platform. “Twitch offers the commentary, the high resolution streaming, all the things gamers want. YouTube has channels. They’ve shown no willingness to create a dedicated portal.”

“What people love about Twitch is that it’s this grass roots thing for them,” added Mr. Schneider.

So it may not be so easy for YouTube to reproduce something like Twitch–just like it’s not so easy for another company, like say Yahoo or Amazon, to instantly launch a YouTube competitor, as so many have speculated about. More often, the next giant social platform or app comes from an entrepreneur, not a big company.

Some in the industry think Twitch could be even bigger than just a gamer site. “I think that’s just the beginning of what’s possible,” said Mr. Gutstein. Machinima has already begun experimenting with live series programming on Twitch, and Mr. Gutstein sees potential for other genres to thrive–such as entertainment-oriented fare.

“All we’ve heard about this generation of young consumers is that they’ll only watch on-demand programming and never watch anything live ever again,” he said. “But look at what Twitch has done. They’ve gotten millions of millennials to watch live content.”
