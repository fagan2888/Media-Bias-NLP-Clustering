U.S. Rep. Brad Wenstrup, a Republican from Ohio\u2019s Second District, presented the medals. (Photo: Thanks to Kathleen Williams)\n\nThe protection of rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution requires all of us to live up to our responsibilities to protect those rights. Protecting the Bill of Rights is an ongoing collaborative balancing activity. This implies that no right is absolute. All rights are conditioned by other rights and our responsibility to uphold them.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s speech made it simply clear that the right to bear arms is a given, but that it needs to be balanced by protecting the right to life and liberty, the right to assemble, the right to worship, the right to speech. Ninety percent of Americans understand this, and agree with it.\n\nUnfortunately, Ohio District 2 is represented by Rep. Brad Wenstrup, who appears to think the right to bear arms is indeed absolute and that common-sense regulation of gun ownership would not have prevented most of the mass shootings we are experiencing almost weekly in our country. On that reasoning, since laws against murder have not stopped murders, we ought not to have laws forbidding murder.\n\nWenstrup says we should do more for mental health, yet he consistently votes against the Affordable Care Act, which insists on treating mental health in the same way we treat all health problems.\n\nCitizens of District 2 should remember these things in November.\n\nTimothy Leonard, Hyde Park\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cin.ci/1ResSB3", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A reader says citizens of District 2 need to know these things about Rep.
