South School drama club lends funky touch to fairy tale



— Over 200 years after the Brothers Grimm penned "Snow White," a cast of more than 60 South Elementary School students is lending a modern twist to the beloved fairy tale.



From the colorfully painted backdrops of woodland scenes and magic mirrors to the upbeat musical score, "The Rockin' Tale of Snow White" tells the familiar story in a way the Grimms never could have imagined.

..

Performances of the musical will take place on Thursday and Friday evenings. The cast will also perform the show for their classmates and teachers during school hours on Wednesday.



Teacher Deanna Poulin, who has led the school's drama program for the past several years, said the show is school's first musical.

..

"There's a lot of different components to this particular show," Poulin said. "We have ballads, we have rapping. There's all kinds of music and dancing."



Animals sing and dance, Snow White's magic mirror has a penchant for rap music and as for these seven dwarves, well they're more likely to "doo-wop" than "hi-ho."

..

Auditions for the show took place in the fall, giving the students plenty of time to build stage props, paint backdrops and perfect their costumes, with rehearsals held twice each week.



Fifth-grader Jillian Maguire plays the role of the evil queen and she said she's been having plenty of fun perfecting her character.

..

"I just think of stuff that makes me angry," she said. "Then I take it out on stage."



Playing the role of the queen's sinister pet bats are fourth-grader Sage Matzker and fifth-grader Jonathan Mok.



"We get to rap along with our buddy, the queen," said Matzker. "It's definitely not like the Disney movie."

..

Fellow fifth-grader Greg Lindquist has been polishing his hip-hop moves to play the role of the singing and dancing magic mirror.



Lindquist had two words to describe his first theater experience. "It's awesome," he said.

..

Both public performances of "The Rocking Tales of Snow White" will begin at 7 p.m. Tickets are $2 per person or $10 per family. Students and staff will also host a bake sale during intermission, with all proceeds to go toward next year's annual show.
