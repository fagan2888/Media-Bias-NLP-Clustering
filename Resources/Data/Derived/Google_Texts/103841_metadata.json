Ander Crenshaw, R-Fla., sponsor of theAchieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act\n\nIn a rare show of bipartisanship, the House recently passed what\u2019s considered \u201cthe broadest legislation to help the disabled in nearly a quarter century,\u201d giving families and advocates a glimmer of hope in the ongoing fight to meet the needs of a vulnerable population.\n\nThe bill, titled the Achieving A Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act, would allow states to establish a program modeled after tax-free college saving accounts. If enacted, families would be able to deposit up to $14,000 annually in accounts at financial institutions with which they would pay for long-term needs, including education, transportation, and health care.\n\nPeople older than the age of 25 qualify if they are diagnosed with a disability that creates \u201cmarked and severe functional limitations.\u201d In all, ABLE account holders would be able to accrue $100,000 in savings without losing eligibility for Social Security and Medicaid, a significant jump in the current asset limit of $2,000.\n\n\u201cToday is a tremendous day for people with disabilities,\u201d William Daroff of the Jewish Federations of North America, which co-chairs the Jewish Disability Network, told Reuters after the House approved the measure. \u201cWe look forward to working with President Obama and the 74 senators co-sponsoring the ABLE Act, and we urge lawmakers to move forward with this bill.\u201d\n\nIf it passes through the Senate, ABLE will stand on the shoulders of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a law enacted in 1990 that provides legal safeguards against discrimination for the disabled. A key part of the legislation required that employers accommodate the needs of their disabled employees, except in cases where doing so would cause \u201cundue burden.\u201d\n\nToday, the ADA protects more than 56 million people \u2014 nearly one-fifth of the American population \u2014 with a disability, nearly half of whom have received a \u201csevere\u201d designation. In 2008, the scope of disabilities under the legislation broadened to include loss of vision, speech impediments, developmental and mental disorders, immobility, and debilitating health issues. Some contingent of disability advocates, however, argue that categorizing some conditions \u2014 autism and deafness, for example \u2014 enables discrimination and social prejudice against those groups.\n\nNonetheless, disabled people still face financial hardship, even with government programs for the group accounting for more than 12 percent of the federal budget. Although disability insurance replaces a portion of a disabled person\u2019s income when they\u2019re no longer able to work, it doesn\u2019t cover the cost of medical care and long-term services, affecting populations older than the age of 65. Private insurance and Medicare also don\u2019t do much in providing long-term care, with coverage for an extensive stay in a nursing home to require that a person be hospitalized for that condition 100 days prior.\n\nEven with Supplemental Security Income, more than 70 percent of families with one or more disabled children have difficulty paying for food, housing, and utilities. Data compiled by the National Council on Disability shows that disabled Americans are three times as likely to live in poverty as their non-disabled counterparts.\n\nFor disabled adults, part of that income disparity stems from an inability of many to enter the workforce, often times as a result of their condition. Less than 20 percent of disabled people hold jobs, compared to more than two in three non-disabled people.\n\nWhile the ADA has included the disabled among the protected classes, some people argue that the bill hasn\u2019t been effective in holding employers accountable to creating more inclusionary hiring practices and paying their disabled employees fairly. For example, a special wage certificate under Section 14(c) of the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act allows employers to pay their disabled workers significantly less than the minimum wage.\n\n\u201cThis is the biggest labor scam in this country right now that nobody\u2019s doing anything about,\u201d former New York Gov. David Paterson, who is legally blind, told the Press & Sun-Bulletin earlier this year. \u201cIt reminds me of the attitude about slavery, where if you try to stick up for the workers they try to tell you \u2018Oh they\u2019re doing what\u2019s best for them.'\u201d\n\nThe bipartisan coalition of congressmen and women \u2014 404 members in total \u2014 that voted for ABLE believe that the legislation would do what\u2019s best for America\u2019s disabled population by providing a means of financial freedom and stability. Earlier this week, Sens. Bob Casey (D-PA) and Richard Burr (R-NC) led a rallying cry among the lawmakers in their chamber to pass ABLE, which now has 74 sponsors.\n\nWhile ABLE\u2019s path to the White House looks clear now more than ever, it has its share of critics \u2014 including the right-wing think tank the Heritage Foundation, whose members argue that the bill could encourage Social Security fraud and abuse.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The families and advocates a glimmer of hope in the ongoing fight to meet the needs of a vulnerable population.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The families and advocates a glimmer of hope in the ongoing fight to meet the needs of a vulnerable population.", "title": "Congress Is Poised To Pass Significant Legislation To Help The Disabled", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/12/05/3600217/congress-poised-pass-able/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/AP671680105966.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The families and advocates a glimmer of hope in the ongoing fight to meet the needs of a vulnerable population.", "title": "Congress Is Poised To Pass Significant Legislation To Help The Disabled", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/AP671680105966-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@SamPKCollins", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/AP671680105966.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/AP671680105966.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-05T13:15:21+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/sampkcollinswriter"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1d6b\"", "article_summary": "The bill, titled the Achieving A Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act, would allow states to establish a program modeled after tax-free college saving accounts.\nNonetheless, disabled people still face financial hardship, even with government programs for the group accounting for more than 12 percent of the federal budget.\nLess than 20 percent of disabled people hold jobs, compared to more than two in three non-disabled people.\nData compiled by the National Council on Disability shows that disabled Americans are three times as likely to live in poverty as their non-disabled counterparts.\nBob Casey (D-PA) and Richard Burr (R-NC) led a rallying cry among the lawmakers in their chamber to pass ABLE, which now has 74 sponsors."}
