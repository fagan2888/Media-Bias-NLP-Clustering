One in five women and one in 33 men will be sexually assaulted during their time on a university campus, that’s according to a justice department study.



Saturday night, a group rallied together on the University of Arizona campus to take a stand against sexual violence in an event called a “Slut

Walk."

Rape and sexual assault can happen at any college campus. At the end of October, there was sexual assault reported near the Koffler Building on the UA campus.

Dozens of students marched through their University on Saturday to draw attention the serious topic.



"Our credibility as victims should not be decided by what we wear,"” said UA sophomore Madison Steinke.



"Slut Walk" is an international movement that started four years ago in Canada in response to comments from Toronto police officers who said if women want to avoid getting sexually assaulted, they should stop dressing like sluts.



'If I'm dressed provocatively or dress in a certain way, that does not by any means give anyone consent to touch me or to rape me," said Cissy Morgan.



Not everyone was supportive of the way the group tried to get its message out.



"I think it wasn’t the right way to go about it," a local mother said.



The bottom line, students hope it starts a conversation about the seriousness of sexual assault.



"Maybe they"ll start to reevaluate how they talk to people in their own lives," said junior Ndekela Sakala.



University of Arizona Police encourage students to use the campus safe ride for a free way to travel between buildings and lots at night.

If you or someone you know becomes a victim of sex assault, you are encouraged to report it to police right away.
