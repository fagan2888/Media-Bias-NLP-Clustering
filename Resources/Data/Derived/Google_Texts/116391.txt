CLEMSON, S.C. — Brent Venables won’t ever forget his fear boarding the plane for Clemson, wondering if trading in his successful life as Oklahoma’s defensive coordinator for an uncertain challenge with the Tigers was the right move.

“I was scared for my family and scared for myself professionally,” said Venables, the Tigers’ fourth-year defensive coordinator. “That’s Oklahoma. That’s not like a steppingstone job.”

Switching sides in college football is rarely pain free, especially when leaving friends and players who you pledged to coach during their careers at your old job.

Venables will feel that twinge once again when No. 1 Clemson (13-0) faces No. 4 Oklahoma (11-1) in the Orange Bowl on New Year’s Eve for a berth in the national championship game.

These teams met last postseason, Clemson pounding Oklahoma 40-6 in the Russell Athletic Bowl.

Venables would rather not face close friends in Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops and defensive coordinator Mike Stoops — the head coach’s brother — for a second consecutive season, but understands programs striving to be the best must ultimately meet to settle things.

“I could certainly handle that,” Venables said.

That was not the case a season ago when Venables was clearly uncomfortable discussing Bob Stoops and the Sooners’ players he helped recruit during his stay there.

Stoops put Venables on his first coaching staff in 1999, and a year later the duo celebrated Oklahoma’s most recent national championship.

This time, only one will leave victorious.

“We know what the stakes are out there,” Venables said.
