The Roosevelts rode as high and far as the national fortunes of New York State. The Tafts go as far as Ohio takes them\u2026. Not the Bushes. Their success is found in an essential rootlessness.\u201d \u2013 Michael Powell, Washington Post, 2001\n\nJeb Bush\u2019s announcement of a presidential campaign exploratory committee \u2013 and the gauntlet immediately thrown down by movement conservatives \u2013 might sound familiar to longtime political observers. But this is not merely because of its similarity to obstacles overcome by John McCain or Mitt Romney. It\u2019s because the reception was nearly identical to that his own father received 51 years ago when he announced his campaign for the U.S. Senate. Indeed, the modern Republican Party\u2019s evolution can be traced along the branches of the Bush family tree, as the ambitions of Bush men compelled a perpetual repositioning to appeal to the party\u2019s activist base. Once a Northeastern and Midwestern party emphasizing fiscal prudence, cooperative multilateralism abroad and social moderation, the party became a Sunbelt party focused on deep tax cuts, international assertiveness rooted in American exceptionalism, and a cultural traditionalism skeptical of modern science while promoting religion in the public square.\n\nThe Patriarch\n\nIn many ways the Republican Party\u2019s evolution begins with a political neophyte seeking an open U.S. Senate seat in Connecticut who was joined at a rally by a fire-breathing Wisconsin conservative. The New Englander, a stately former Skull and Bones member at Yale who became a wealthy and prominent Manhattan investment banker, was Prescott Bush, George W. and Jeb\u2019s grandfather. The imported political talent who headlined the event was a vehement anti-Communist offering red meat and rough edges: Senator Joseph McCarthy. McCarthy was in Bridgeport to raise Bush\u2019s profile and fire up rank-and-file Republicans. But though he welcomed \u201cTailgunner Joe\u201d to Connecticut, Pres later noted that he had \u201cvery considerable reservations\u2026 concerning the methods which he employs.\u201d\n\nMcCarthyism was not Pres Bush\u2019s brand of Republicanism; indeed, Pres described himself as a \u201cmoderate progressive\u201d concerned about the conditions in dilapidated urban slums, with which he had become familiar in his longtime role as state chairman of the United Negro College Fund. But his philanthropic efforts did not preclude a belief in the need for government support: once elected, Pres focused on affordable housing preservation, spearheading the 1954 Housing Act, which contained $150 million for 26 Connecticut cities, giving Connecticut more money per capita than any state. He exhorted Congress to \u201chave the courage to raise the required revenues by approving whatever levels of taxation may be necessary\u201d to fund education and research. He drafted legislation that expedited the construction of local flood protection works. He stood to the left of his party on everything from taxes and civil rights to infrastructure and immigration.\n\nA Son Heads for Texas\n\nPrescott\u2019s son George H. W. Bush (\u201cBush\u201d) left for Texas to make a name for himself outside of his father\u2019s shadow. Bush moved his family to West Texas in 1948, during Texas\u2019 first era of one-party rule, and started a company in the oil business. But by the time he decided to run for the U.S. Senate in 1963, he encountered a thriving Texas Republican Party. It had just elected its first United States Senator by prying conservative Democrats away from their ancestral home; perceived Democratic support of civil rights was anathema to many Democrats. Bush\u2019s only problem was that the rank-and-file Texas Republicans were not much like the Connecticut Republicans who had elected his father.\n\nAccording to Texas writer Molly Ivins, Bush would never truly be accepted in the Lone Star State, because \u201creal Texans do not use the word summer as a verb \u2026 and do not wear blue slacks with little green whales all over them.\u201d Observing the 1964 race, Texas Observer editor Ronnie Dugger noted that Bush\u2019s campaign \u201cgets its sparkle from the young Republican matrons who are enthusiastic about him personally and have plenty of money for baby sitters and nothing much to do with their time.\u201d Unfortunately for Bush, there were not enough of these types to nominate a Rockefeller Republican in a contested Texas primary.\n\nDespite his East Coast upbringing, Bush was determined to fit in \u2013 whatever it took. He realized that whatever appearances might suggest, the substance of his campaign would need to be more Goldwater than Rockefeller. The party was changing, and the South was leading that change. Republicanism had come to the South from the top down, spawned in the silk-stocking suburbs of booming Rim South metropolises like Charlotte and Memphis by people not much different, culturally speaking, from the Bushes. But now, with the aid of Goldwater\u2019s staunch opposition to the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Republicanism was spreading like wildfire throughout the Deep South. The John Birch Society types who flooded Republican events were highly suspicious of the Manhattan financier cliques, and so Bush provided an easy target. Wrote Richard Ben Cramer in his classic \u201cWhat it Takes\u201d:\n\n\u201c\u2026[T]he nuts hated him. They could smell Yale on him. He was always saying stuff like, \u2018We have the same basic goals\u2026\u2019 He couldn\u2019t seem to get what was basic to the Birchers: being rid of him and everyone like him\u2026 like Eisenhower, Rockefeller\u2026 like all those rich, pointy-head, one-worlder, eastern-Harvard-Yale-country-club-Council-on-Foreign-Relations commie dupes!\u201d\n\nBush strained to connect with the Birchers. He lambasted incumbent Democratic Senator Ralph Yarborough for voting to end the filibuster on the Civil Rights Act, which would, he claimed, destroy the judicial system. He proclaimed that if the United Nations seated the \u201cRed\u201d Chinese, the U.S. should \u201cget the hell out\u201d of the organization. He mused about ending all foreign aid except to arm the Cuban exiles. And he exalted capitalism\u2019s virtues: \u201cOnly unbridled free enterprise can cure unemployment,\u201d he said; capitalism \u201cmust be completely unfettered.\u201d A proposal to establish a domestic Peace Corps was a \u201chalf-baked pie in the sky;\u201d the federal government ought to abdicate all responsibility for alleviating poverty. Yet no matter how hard he tried, Bush never earned the right wing\u2019s trust; even after his son was elected president, many conservatives still attributed George W.\u2019s few moderate instincts to the insidious influence of his parents.\n\nBush lost the Senate race. But in 1966, the Republican establishment in Texas carved out a safe seat for him in a posh Houston area much more suited to his father\u2019s style of Republicanism, and he won easily. Bush was in Congress when the 1968 Open Housing Act came up for a vote, and he decided to give each side a nod. Bush earned the wrath of conservatives in his district by voting for the final bill, but on the key procedural vote to send the bill\u2019s toughest provisions back to committee, Bush sided with conservatives. Always, betwixt in between.\n\nIn 1970, Bush ran for the Senate again, running against conservative Democrat Lloyd Bentsen, who had ousted liberal Ralph Yarborough. With scant ability to draw contrasts, Bush lost again. He spent the next decade as Republican National Committee chairman, CIA director, and ambassador to China. In 1979, Bush began his quest for national office, and emerged as the moderate alternative to conservative darling Ronald Reagan, who had wowed the right with his spirited 1976 primary challenge. The primaries were a mismatch, but after their conclusion, Reagan confounded conservatives by choosing Bush as his running mate. Whereas Reagan had consistently espoused deep tax cuts, Bush had famously dubbed Reagan\u2019s tax plan \u201cvoodoo economics.\u201d But now, he was part of Reagan\u2019s team \u2013 a key step in the metamorphosis of the Bush clan.\n\nGeorge H. W. Bush: Transitional Figure\n\nWhatever Prescott Bush\u2019s views, his son took his cues much more from Ronald Reagan than from his father once ensconced in the vice presidency. George H. W. Bush\u2019s gradual transition was quiet, but by the time he stepped out into the spotlight at the 1988 GOP convention to become the Republicans standard-bearer, the \u201cvoodoo economics\u201d line was replaced with his famous \u201cRead my lips: No new taxes!\u201d pledge. Bush had outflanked Bob Dole in the primaries (Dole had refused a similar pledge, instead promising to eliminate the deficit), and Bush delivered his convention rhetoric with a convert\u2019s zeal.\n\nOf course, that all changed with the recession of 1990, which caused Bush to reevaluate his pledge and approve a bipartisan compromise to raise taxes and reduce the ballooning deficit. The deal was widely repudiated by House Republicans, whose posture had shifted dramatically since Bush had served there. Then, Republicans had been a docile minority, vastly outnumbered by Democrats after the 1964 landslide and loathe to rock the institutional boat. But as the parties polarized, the House Bush encountered was a much different one. Whereas the House Republican leader, moderate Bob Michel, enjoyed a collegial relationship with Democrats and retained the loyalty of older Republicans, the norm of bipartisan comity was conspicuously rejected by his successor, Georgia bombthrower Newt Gingrich.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Gingrichites skewered Bush\u2019s 1990 tax deal. When Bush left the White House in 1993, he had embraced bits and pieces of Reagan\u2019s agenda. But although conservatives originally fancied his presidency as \u201cReagan\u2019s third term,\u201d he was unable to accomplish the sweeping tax, regulatory, or social changes they sought. He never adopted the overarching Reagan philosophy of limited government nor Reagan\u2019s aggressive posture toward hostile nations. Despite his efforts, he never seemed like a true Texan, conservative, or \u201cregular guy,\u201d and his gaffes fed this perception, as when he blamed his poor 1987 Iowa straw poll showing on supporters who were \u201cat their daughter\u2019s coming-out party, or teeing up on the golf course.\u201d He was a transitional figure: an ideological, geographic and cultural bridge from one Bush generation to the next.\n\nThis helps explain why George Bush struggled to connect with voters: he did not emanate a sense of place. He seemed forever betwixt and between his New England upbringing and his adopted Texas home. He never understood why he was so widely mocked for claiming to eat pork rinds, but any late-night talk show viewer immediately got the joke: he was trying too hard to be something he was not. It would fall to his son to complete the Bush dynasty\u2019s evolution from northeastern Rockefeller moderation to evangelical Sun-Belt conservatism.\n\nGeorge W., Son of the South\n\nWhen George W. Bush (\u201cW\u201d) first sought office in Texas, most people understood that his father\u2019s central political problem had been his elitist bearing. In his own 1978 congressional bid, W faced similar issues. Democratic Rep. Kent Hance contrasted his local high school with W\u2019s alma mater, Andover Academy; W exacerbated the problem with a commercial meant to highlight his vigor that showed him jogging, which he pulled after Hance noted that a West Texan would only be seen running if he was being chased. But by 1994, W learned his lesson. Having converted to evangelical Christianity, he incorporated religious imagery and themes into his speeches. Governor Ann Richards could not \u201cout-Texan\u201d him, and he upset her in a strong Republican year.\n\nThe Party of Fiscal Prudence Embraces Deficits\n\nGeorge W. Bush\u2019s first significant proposal as a presidential candidate was a $1.6 trillion tax cut, and his first major accomplishment was its enactment. It was originally designed to insulate him from 2000 primary rival Steve Forbes\u2019s expected charge that he was, like his father, \u201csoft\u201d on taxes. Green-eyeshades Republicans were aghast at the plan, which resembled the \u201cvoodoo economics\u201d his father had disparaged.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Going back to the days of Prescott Bush, one thing unites all Bush politicians.
