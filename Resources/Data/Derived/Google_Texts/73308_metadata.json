Telligen is the QIN-QIO for Iowa, Colorado, and Illinois.\n\nCMS created QIN-QIOs, which the agency has named them, under the Social Security Act and relies on them to improve the quality of health care for Medicare beneficiaries. QIN-QIOs work with providers and practitioners across communities in every state to reduce adverse drug events and improve medication safety, especially when it involves opioids, anticoagulants, and diabetes medications.\n\n\u201cPharmacists are a key stakeholder in this work,\u201d said Anita Thomas, PharmD, CMS\u2019s QIO patient safety program lead.\n\nQIN-QIOs can share data and educational support that relates to adverse drug event reduction and find ways to improve medication safety.\n\nReducing hospital readmissions\n\nAs payment moves from fee for service to a value-based model, health care providers, including pharmacists, will be required to implement and understand the quality improvement process as well as measure their performance to demonstrate value.\n\nTransitions of care is one area pharmacists can have an immediate impact.\n\n\u201cThis scope of work lends itself to greater pharmacy involvement where medication safety is at the forefront of readmission rates,\u201d Brown told Pharmacy Today.\n\nHospitals are now being penalized for excess readmissions through the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, which was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nJennifer Thomas, PharmD, medication safety/adverse drug event lead for the Atlantic QIN for the District of Columbia, said that one of the pharmacy representatives they work with expressed that partnering with the QIN-QIO helped hospitals learn about bedside delivery programs, which in turn allowed the pharmacy to \u201cachieve the first fill [adherence] for the discharged patient and subsequent refills with the pharmacy.\u201d\n\nThomas said pharmacies should be aware that quality improvement initiatives may affect CMS star ratings, payer networks, and community perception of pharmacy services now and in the future. In addition, these initiatives may be required to determine preferred networks for third party payers, including Medicare Part D.\n\nIt could also be key for provider status by allowing pharmacists to demonstrate definitive ways they can affect medication safety and reduce hospital readmissions.\n\nQIN-QIOs in action\n\nPharmacies are actively seeking help from QIN-QIOs. NuCara Pharmacy, one of the pharmacies Brown works with, is interested in exploring clinical services, seeking payment to maintain their business, and helping to achieve provider status recognition for pharmacists.\n\nIn particular, they are looking at cost savings and outcomes improvement of pharmacist comprehensive medication management through physician referrals.\n\n\u201cThey are assessing the risk of the patient based on the medications they are taking and analyzing their recommendations not only in the cost of care but in things like adherence and preventing adverse drug events,\u201d said Brown.\n\nShe said she has also begun doing a lot of work with medication reconciliation.\n\n\u201cThat breakdown of communication in the community is causing huge problems in preventing safe use of medication as it relates to transfer or discharge,\u201d said Brown.\n\nTake initiative\n\nOverall, Brown said pharmacists can elevate the care they provide through their involvement with QIN-QIOs. The support pharmacies gain is also free of charge since QIN-QIOs are already funded.\n\n\u201cThe fact that every QIN-QIO doesn\u2019t have a pharmacist speaks to the fact that this is a new direction,\u201d said Brown. \u201cI would advocate that we need to do a better job of reaching out through our associations to those providers who are interested in our support.\u201d\n\nWays to be involved with CMS\u2019s QIN-QIOs", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "American Pharmacists Association", "description": "Pharmacists should know about Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs) or Quality Innovation Networks (QINs).", "title": "How pharmacists are working with CMS\u2019s QIN-QIOs", "url": "https://www.pharmacist.com/how-pharmacists-are-working-cms-s-qin-qios", "image": "/sites/default/files/images/APhA-footer-logo.png", "updated_time": "2015-11-17T09:49:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-17T09:49:59-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-17T09:49:59-05:00"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Pharmacists should know about Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs) or Quality Innovation Networks (QINs).", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Pharmacists should know about Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs) or Quality Innovation Networks (QINs).\nQIN-QIOs can share data and educational support that relates to adverse drug event reduction and find ways to improve medication safety.\n\u201cPharmacists are a key stakeholder in this work,\u201d said Anita Thomas, PharmD, CMS\u2019s QIO patient safety program lead.\nTake initiativeOverall, Brown said pharmacists can elevate the care they provide through their involvement with QIN-QIOs.\nQIN-QIOs work with providers and practitioners across communities in every state to reduce adverse drug events and improve medication safety, especially when it involves opioids, anticoagulants, and diabetes medications."}
