Sanders does not have a prayer, and I suspect all but Democrats know it.\n\nThen there is President Obama\u2019s health care debacle that become reality on the backs of senior citizens. And don\u2019t forget the billions Obama pilfered from Medicare to jump-start Obamacare.\n\nMany Americans also sacrificed by losing coverage they liked and could afford. Too many were presented replacement policies with higher premiums, less coverage, higher deductibles \u2014 and sometimes the loss of their doctor.\n\nThe reality is the deductible, which could be thousands, and the premiums come out of consumer pockets before insurance pays a dime.\n\nA large group of the newly-insured are still seeking care at emergency rooms. Having an insurance card in your pocket does not guarantee health care.\n\nAnd this is a fact.\n\nAt this point, everyone knows Hillary Clinton has a shaky relationship with the truth, in just about every circumstance. She will not be indicted for her illegal email activities, nor for the loss of American lives in Benghazi (which she and president lied about for weeks) because our progressive president needs her to complete his agenda.\n\nThe sad truth is there is no honor among these power-mad, win-at-all-costs, politicians.\n\nMary Chumbley\n\nCanyon", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Letters to the Editor, Opinion", "og": {"site_name": "Amarillo Globe-News", "description": "A frequent contributor to the Amarillo Globe-News editorial page recently made some interesting comments that need to be revisited (Letter: Give a solid reason not to vote Republican, April 23, amarillo.com).", "title": "Letter: Democrats are weakening America", "url": "http://amarillo.com/opinion/letters-editor/2016-05-01/letter-democrats-are-weakening-america", "image": "http://amarillo.com/sites/default/files/15312483.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "A frequent contributor to the Amarillo Globe-News editorial page recently made some interesting comments that need to be revisited (Letter: Give a solid reason not to vote Republican, April 23, amarillo.com).First, socialist democrat Bernie Sanders is campaigning for the Democrat nomination simply to keep Hillary Clinton\u2019s nomination from being a coronation.
