(Amy Sussman/Invision/AP)\n\nAmong television\u2019s many bad psychiatrists and psychologists \u2014 Frasier Crane of \u201cFrasier,\u201d Jennifer Melfi of \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d \u2014 Dr. Hannibal Lecter is probably the worst. As depicted in the recently-canceled NBC show \u201cHannibal,\u201d not only is Lecter a cannibal bent on murder and mayhem, but an emotionally empty vessel \u2014 a cold fish lacking in empathy. When presented with a patient, he sees not a person desperately in need of care, but an ingredient for a gourmet meal.\n\nAs horrible as Lecter\u2019s attitude is, however \u2014 and as curt as some doctors seem in an age of rushed consultations that take a toll on health-care quality \u2014 it takes two to tango. In a new paper published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science, researchers found that patients sometimes perceive their doctors as mere robots \u2014 a perception that may change the quality of the care they receive.\n\n\u201cPatients believe physicians are like empty vessels,\u201d Juliana Schroeder, an assistant professor of management at the University of California at Berkeley, and Ayelet Fishbach, a professor of behavioral science and marketing at the University of Chicago, wrote. \u201c\u2026 We provide evidence that when in greater need of health care, individuals perceive physicians as lacking personal attributes and not having personal lives but want physicians who have patient focused attributes.\u201d\n\nFor the paper \u2014 \u201cThe \u2018Empty Vessel\u2019 Physician: Physicians Instrumentality Makes Them Seem Personally Empty\u201d \u2014 Schroeder and Fishbach completed six different experiments that measured how important participants perceived doctors in their lives. What they found was surprising, Schroeder said \u2014 the more a person thought they needed a doctor, the less they knew about that doctor\u2019s personal life.\n\n\u201cYou might expect that the more someone needs their physician, the more they attend to every single aspect of their lives,\u201d Schroder said in a telephone interview with The Washington Post. \u201cThey should care more about them when they need them.\u201d\n\nJuliana Schroeder. (Courtesy Juliana Schroeder)\n\nIn one survey of 99 patients, Schroeder and Fishbach determined patients knew fewer facts about, for example, the marital status or hobbies of their doctors than the number of similar facts they thought their doctors knew about them. And, unexpectedly, the greater a doctor\u2019s \u201cinstrumentality\u201d \u2014 that is, importance \u2014 to a patient\u2019s care, the fewer facts a patient knew about that doctor.\n\n\u201cPatients seem to overlook physicians\u2019 personal experiences, yet believe physicians are attentive to the personal details of their patients\u2019 lives,\u201d the paper read.\n\nAnother survey of 70 patients \u2014 memorably called \u201cSurprised by Dentists\u2019 Experiential Activities\u201d \u2014 measured how surprised patients would be to see their dentist at \u201ca fancy-five star restaurant\u201d or \u201cthe city\u2019s best museum.\u201d In the paper\u2019s logic, such \u201cexperiental activities\u201d would show a dentist\u2019s rich personal life as opposed to, say, seeing one\u2019s dentist at a Laundromat or grocery store.\n\n\u201cParticipants who felt like they needed their dentists more reported that they would be more surprised to see them engaging in experiential activities and not just at low-status locations,\u201d the paper read.\n\nAnd, as the researchers found by comparing 70 patients in the waiting room of a university medical center with 80 non-patients in a dining hall, those worried about their teeth were more likely to think physicians\u2019 emotional focus is on them.\n\n\u201cClinic patients, who have greater need for health care, perceive physicians to have less self-focused emotion compared to non-patients who have less need,\u201d Schroeder and Fishbach wrote.\n\nIn some ways, this isn\u2019t shocking. Of course: People who think they are sick want more attention than people who think they are healthy, and expect their doctors to give them that attention. Isn\u2019t that what doctors get paid so much for?\n\nNo one is immune to feeling slighted \u2014 even an MD. \u201cPatients\u2019 perceptions may also affect physicians,\u201d Schroeder and Fishbach wrote. \u201c\u2026 Negative consequences may result when patients overlook physicians\u2019 personal characteristics (e.g., self-focused emotions) the patient does not need.\u201d Such patient attitudes can \u201cmake people feel objectified\u201d and \u201ccontribute to physician burnout.\u201d Forty-six percent of physicians in a recent survey, the researchers noted, \u201creport experiencing at least one symptom of burnout.\u201d\n\n\u201cFeeling objectified might lead to dislike for the patient, which might lead to worse care for the patient, who did the quasi-objectifying in the first place, because he had a problem and saw the doctor as the solution,\u201d Julie Beck wrote in a piece about the study at the Atlantic.\n\nAlmost six years after the passage of the Affordable Health Care Act, legislators are still debating how to make doctors more responsive to patients. But, it seems, some of that burden may be on patients.\n\n\u201cThis suggests \u2014 ironically \u2014 that patients\u2019 own perceptions of their physicians as empty vessels could, at least partly, ultimately reduce their quality of care,\u201d Schroeder and Fishbach wrote. \u201cPractitioners and policy makers considering how to improve health care quality may therefore want to target patients\u2019 attitudes toward their physicians, not just physicians\u2019 attitudes toward patients.\u201d\n\nAnd, of course, \u201cempty vessels\u201d aren\u2019t just in exam rooms. Schroeder pointed out a similar dynamic may play out in \u201cexchange relationships\u201d such as those between employers and employees. Bosses like to be asked how their days are going, too.\n\n\u201cPeople appreciate it when you notice personal aspects of their lives,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s less of an exchange relationship, more of a personal relationship.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The sicker you are, the less of a personal life you think your doctor has, researchers found.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The sicker you are, the less of a personal life you think your doctor has, researchers found.", "title": "Why you might think your doctor is \u2018personally empty\u2019", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/09/25/why-you-might-think-your-doctor-is-personally-empty/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2015/09/CROP-AP_50259934973.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@justinwmmoyer"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/09/25/why-you-might-think-your-doctor-is-personally-empty/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "hannibal, empty vessel, doctor, personally empty, The Empty Vessel Physician, julia schroeder", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "hannibal, empty vessel, doctor, personally empty, The Empty Vessel Physician, julia schroeder"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc18e\"", "article_summary": "What they found was surprising, Schroeder said \u2014 the more a person thought they needed a doctor, the less they knew about that doctor\u2019s personal life.\n\u201cPatients seem to overlook physicians\u2019 personal experiences, yet believe physicians are attentive to the personal details of their patients\u2019 lives,\u201d the paper read.\nAnd, unexpectedly, the greater a doctor\u2019s \u201cinstrumentality\u201d \u2014 that is, importance \u2014 to a patient\u2019s care, the fewer facts a patient knew about that doctor.\nOf course: People who think they are sick want more attention than people who think they are healthy, and expect their doctors to give them that attention.\nWhen presented with a patient, he sees not a person desperately in need of care, but an ingredient for a gourmet meal."}
