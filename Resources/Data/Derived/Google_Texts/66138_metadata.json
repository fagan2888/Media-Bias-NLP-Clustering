Borzi, assistant secretary of the Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration, said Feb. 20 in a DOL news release.\n\nThe final regulations apply to plan years beginning on or after Jan. 1, 2015. They were released Feb. 20 and published in the Feb. 24 Federal Register (79 Fed. Reg. 10,296, 2/24/14) by the Treasury Department's Internal Revenue Service, Department of Health and Human Services and EBSA.\n\nWaiting Period\n\nFor plan years beginning in 2014, the agencies will consider compliance with either the IRS, HHS and EBSA rules proposed in 2013 (REG-122706-12), 3or these final regulations, to constitute compliance with the ACA.\n\nThe final regulations continue to define \u201cwaiting period\u201d as the period that must pass before coverage for an individual who is otherwise eligible to enroll under the terms of a group health plan can become effective. Nothing in the final regulations requires a plan or issuer to have any waiting period, or prevents a plan or issuer from having a waiting period that is shorter than 90 days, the agencies said.\n\nAlong with the final regulations, the three agencies simultaneously released proposed regulations (REG-122706-12) intended to clarify the maximum allowed length of any reasonable employment-based orientation period, consistent with the 90-day waiting period limitations added by the ACA.\n\nThe final rules say that being otherwise eligible to enroll in a plan means having met the plan's eligibility conditions, including satisfying a \u201creasonable and bona fide employment-based eligibility period.\u201d\n\nRehires\n\nThe final rules also provide that a former employee who is rehired can be treated as newly eligible for coverage and, therefore, a plan or issuer may require that individual to meet the plan's eligibility criteria and satisfy the plan's waiting period again.\n\nThe eligibility and waiting period requirements must be reasonable under the circumstances, the agencies said. For example, the termination and rehire can't be used as a subterfuge to avoid compliance with the 90-day waiting period.\n\nThe same analysis would apply for an individual who moves to a job classification that is ineligible for coverage under the plan but then later moves back to an eligible job classification, the agencies said.\n\nHealth Insurance Issuers\n\nThe final rules include a provision allowing health insurance issuers to rely on eligibility information supplied by an employer or other plan sponsor.\n\nHealth insurance issuers will comply with the rule if both of the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n\u2022 the issuer requires the plan sponsor to make a representation regarding the terms of any eligibility conditions or waiting periods imposed by the plan sponsor and\n\n\u2022 the issuer has no specific knowledge of the imposition of a waiting period that would exceed the permitted 90-day period.\n\nOrientation Period\n\nThe agencies also proposed rules that would provide that one month is the maximum allowed length of any reasonable and bona fide employment-based orientation period.\n\nThe agencies said the proposed rules are necessary, because the final rules don't specify the facts and circumstances under which an employment-based orientation period wouldn't be considered \u201creasonable and bona fide.\u201d\n\nThe agencies said that during an orientation period they envision that an employer and employee could evaluate whether the employment situation was satisfactory for each party, and standard orientation and training processes would begin.\n\nUnder the proposed rules, one month would be determined by adding one calendar month and subtracting one calendar day, measured from the employee's start date in a position that is otherwise eligible for coverage.\n\nFor example, the agencies said if an employee's start date in an otherwise eligible position is May 3, the last permitted day of the orientation period would be June 2.\n\nIf there isn't a corresponding date in the next calendar month after adding a calendar month, the last permitted date in the orientation period would be the last day of the next calendar month, the agencies said.\n\nThe proposed rules were also published in the Feb. 24 Federal Register (79 Fed. Reg. 10,320, 2/24/14).\n\nComments on the proposed rules must be received by April 25.\n\n\n\nExcerpted from a story that ran in Pension & Benefits Daily (2/20/2014).", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/guidance-aca-90day-b17179882470/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "Group health plans or health insurance issuers offering group health insurance coverage can't apply a waiting period that exceeds 90 days for individuals to be eligible for benefits coverage under...", "title": "Guidance on ACA 90-Day Waiting Periods  Issued in Tri-Agency Final, Proposed Rules"}, "csrf-token": "1f9eibsNpYd_r8hCbdMUS3c3l0YwxhJd-ATIBJzyawvBlbu7JyiMFQvx4x0O58uMj9EukpZ8hb5gQqcSZpR1EKgnLjHZzgDSvo7hzKuotzU1:7nDYCcXaxei0N2iVVIvbzFHbSmQLYhquIa22QCzOQOkbUGYvf-Rk2w83AO42mS534GHNA24-vjYMtJC2v7VPgGGzt0gUsXubu8v8QgXJPto1", "description": "Group health plans or health insurance issuers offering group health insurance coverage can't apply a waiting period that exceeds 90 days for individuals to be eligible for benefits coverage under", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fragment": "!"}, "article_summary": "For example, the termination and rehire can't be used as a subterfuge to avoid compliance with the 90-day waiting period.\n9656, sets forth rules governing the relationship between a plan's eligibility criteria and the 90-day waiting period limitation, and is effective April 25.\nThe proposed rules were also published in the Feb. 24 Federal Register (79 Fed.\nComments on the proposed rules must be received by April 25.\nOrientation PeriodThe agencies also proposed rules that would provide that one month is the maximum allowed length of any reasonable and bona fide employment-based orientation period."}
