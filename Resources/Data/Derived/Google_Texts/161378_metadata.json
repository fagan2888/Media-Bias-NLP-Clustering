But with BD being the largest in this segment and having a predominance of our business in the U.S., (we are) going to be disproportionately disadvantaged.\u201d\n\nSANDY \u2014 Will a federally mandated tax on medical devices have a negative impact on future innovation? Critics of the measure say the answer is a resounding \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nSpeaking Wednesday at BD Medical's production facility at 9450 S. State, the company's vice president said a recently enacted provision of the Affordable Care Act will cost his firm about $55 million per year, forcing it to cut back on new research and potential technology breakthroughs that could benefit patients worldwide.\n\n\u201cOur customers are hospitals, nursing homes and research institutions,\u201d Gary Shearer said. \u201cWe have to be very cost-conscious (and) be very leading-edge with our technology, especially against foreign countries that don\u2019t have the tax.\u201d\n\nAs of Jan. 1, the Affordable Care Act mandated that manufacturers and importers pay a 2.3 percent medical device excise tax on sales of certain products. Revenue from the tax is designed to help pay for the law\u2019s expansion of Medicaid coverage and financial assistance for people purchasing health coverage through the open marketplace.\n\nThe device tax only applies to clinical medical devices such as stents, catheters and defibrillators that are sold to U.S. health care providers. Devices manufactured abroad and in the U.S. are subject to the tax.\n\nHowever, consumer devices such as hearing aids, wheelchairs, thermometers and contact lenses are not subject to the tax. The medical device tax is expected to raise $30 billion over the next decade.\n\nShearer said the federal tax creates a financial challenge that negatively affects BD Medical\u2019s ability to compete in the global market. While the company supports efforts to expand access of health coverage and disease prevention to more people, he said, the tax will hinder the BD's ability to produce more innovative products.\n\n\u201cThe costs associated with the device tax has slowed our investment in research and development, and U.S. manufacturing capacity,\u201d Shearer said.\n\nWhen expenses such as the Affordable Care Act tax are imposed, companies typically cut back in research and development rather than other areas of their business, Shearer said.\n\nBecton, Dickinson and Co. is a global medical technology company headquartered in Franklin Lakes, N.J. The company has a regional facility in Sandy and employs about 1,000 people in Utah.\n\nOn Tuesday, BD Medical hosted Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, for a tour of its facility and manufacturing operations.\n\nAccording to BD business marketing director Richard Scott, the company faces stiff competition from other large device makers in Germany and the United Kingdom. Because BD generates 40 percent of its business in the U.S., having to pay millions of dollars in additional taxes is creating a financial obstacle, he said.\n\n\u201cEvery (company) has to play by the tax rules in their individual country,\u201d Scott said. \u201cBut with BD being the largest in this segment and having a predominance of our business in the U.S., (we are) going to be disproportionately disadvantaged.\u201d\n\nLate last year, another Utah medical device maker raised similar criticism.\n\nIn October 2013, Merit Medical CEO Fred Lampropolous said the medical device excise tax was \u201cclearly without any comparison the most difficult situation we've had to face in 34 years.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Lampropolous estimated the tax would cost his company as much as $7 million a year. To mitigate the losses, the company no longer matches employees' retirement contributions, and it cut donations to some local charities.\n\nFor BD, the expense is on a larger scale, and the impacts will be felt in different areas of its business, Shearer said.\n\n\u201cWhere that hurts us is future growth,\u201d he said.\n\nEmail: jlee@deseretnews.com\n\nTwitter: JasenLee1", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"description": "The vice president of manufacturing for BD Medical said a recently enacted provision of the Affordable Care Act will cost his firm about $55 million per year, forcing the company to cut back on new re", "title": "Utah medical device manufacturer says Affordable Care Act tax will...", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "itms://itunes.apple.com/us/app/deseret-news/id425758986?mt=8&uo=4", "iphone": "itms://itunes.apple.com/us/app/deseret-news/id425758986?mt=8&uo=4", "googleplay": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deseretnews.android"}, "name": {"ipad": "Deseret News", "iphone": "Deseret News", "googleplay": "Deseret News"}, "id": {"ipad": 425758986, "iphone": 425758986, "googleplay": "com.deseretnews.android"}}, "creator": "@JasenLee1", "site": "@deseretnews", "card": "summary"}, "datePublished": "2014-01-22", "vr": {"category": "utah", "type": "article"}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"recommendable": "false"}}, "speare-timestamp": "2014-01-22 15:30:00", "copyright": "\u00a9 2016 Deseret News Publishing Company", "title": "Utah medical device manufacturer says Affordable Care Act tax will hurt innovation", "image": "http://www.deseretnews.com/media/photos/web-1287687.jpg", "dsk": "utah", "tout": {"article": {"id": 865594675}}, "thumbnail": "http://www.deseretnews.com/media/photos/web-1287687.jpg", "medium": "news", "description": "The vice president of manufacturing for BD Medical said a recently enacted provision of the Affordable Care Act will cost his firm about $55 million per year, forcing the company to cut back on new re", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "fb": {"admins": 683545112, "app_id": 320112201431112, "pages": 16317479654}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-22T15:30-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=1024, initial-scale=0.1", "GOOGLEBOT": "ARCHIVE", "og": {"url": "http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865594675/Medical-device-maker-impacted-by-Affordable-Care-Act-tax.html?pg=all", "type": "article", "image": "http://img.deseretnews.com/images/article/hires/1287687/1287687.jpg", "site_name": "DeseretNews.com", "title": "Utah medical device manufacturer says Affordable Care Act tax will hurt innovation"}, "author": "Jasen Lee", "dateModified": "2014-01-22", "articleid": 865594675}, "article_summary": "The medical device tax is expected to raise $30 billion over the next decade.\nBecton, Dickinson and Co. is a global medical technology company headquartered in Franklin Lakes, N.J.\nThe device tax only applies to clinical medical devices such as stents, catheters and defibrillators that are sold to U.S. health care providers.\nOn Tuesday, BD Medical hosted Sen.
