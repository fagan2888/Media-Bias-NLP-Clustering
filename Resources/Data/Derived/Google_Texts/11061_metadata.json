An alumnus, Talia Gallagher, who is now a student at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. started a petition campaign to change the name. She\u2019s going to present it to the local Board of Education in March. The details are at this Facebook page.\n\nWord got out and there have been a number of reports in the media and inevitably opposition. Here\u2019s an entry in an opposing Facebook page called \u201cNorth Haven Indians Pride.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did our Indian mascot come from? It was to honor the Indians of North Haven. The indian symbol in our mascot is the look of chief Montowese who we lived with here in North Haven,\u201d they posted. \u201cOur Mascot is to honor the memory of the North Haven Indian tribes, not to poke fun or to discriminate. The American settlers of North Haven lived with the Indians, we worked together.\"\n\nOh yes, New Haven settlers lived with the Indians. That\u2019s why the colony of Connecticut allowed all Quinnipiac land to be sold off as early as 1695, about 90 years before the town of North Haven was incorporated. Honor the memory of the tribes? Give me a break. Mascots are chosen to be fierce or funny or exotic. You think it would be honoring memory if a Berlin Germany soccer team was called \u201cthe Jews?\u201d\n\nGallagher said she first became aware of the issue when she was a high school junior, but only decided to act after she went to college and became an activist around issues of police brutality particularly Ferguson.\n\nI asked her how the mascot was depicted in North Haven. She said it was more or less like a stereotypical Plains Indian with a headband and several feathers. There was nothing particularly vicious in the way it was done, just unthinking. Students at games chant \u201ctribe pride\u201d and put on so-called \u201cwar paint.\u201d Last year the girl who was winner of the school spirit contest was photographed wearing a full feathered headdress.\n\nGallagher\u2019s petition states the simple truth: \u201cTowns and cities all around the country are starting to switch over to appropriate team names and mascots and it is time for North Haven to join the movement. Our town must take a stand and change the old and disrespectful ways people think about race.,\u201d.\n\nThe New Haven Register, which itself says it\u2019s time to abandon Indian mascots, says there are 23 Connecticut teams with some variation of Indian mascot names. Quinnipiac University, next door in Hamden, did change the name of its mascot from the Braves to the Bobcats in 2002.\n\nSo What Can We Do to Help?\n\n\u2014Sign the online petition to the North Haven Board of Education;\n\n\u2014Write to the North Haven Board of Education via Superintendent Cronin, and if you are from an Indian nation, mention it;\n\n\u2014Have well-known Indian leaders, athletes, celebrities, and heads of organizations write a letter;\n\n\u2014Solicit letters from human rights organizations, anti-racism groups, etc.;\n\n\u2014Comment in an educational way on the Facebook page that supports keeping the \u201cIndians\u201d name;\n\n\u2014Get the teacher unions involved. North Haven\u2019s union is an affiliate of the Connecticut Education Association (CEA). Contact the NHEA at: North Haven Education Association, 221 Elm Street, North Haven, CT 06473. Contact the CEA here and the National Education Association here and ask them to make statements. Another big teachers union in Connecticut is the American Federation of Teachers. Contact their president here;\n\n\n\n\u2014Write letters to the New Haven Register;\n\n\u2014Write an online comment in answer to this opinion piece in the North Haven Citizen;\n\n\u2014Write or link to accounts of successful campaigns to change away from insulting mascots;\n\n\n\n\u2014Get members of various Indian nations to attend the Thursday, March 12, Board of Education meeting at 6:30 p.m. meeting (5 Linsley Street, North Haven). Hold a press conference just before the meeting;\n\n\u2014Make short videos explaining why Indian nations find the idea of being a mascot offensive;\n\n\u2014Tweet about North Haven #NotYourMascot;\n\n\u2014Here\u2019s a final suggestion. North Haven is just a few miles away from a major geographical feature, a small mountain called \u201cSleeping Giant.\u201d Why not change the name of the mascot to the Giants? Maybe San Francisco Giants superstar Madison Bumgarner could be persuaded to come to North Haven and wear the first new sweatshirt!\n\nStanley Heller is producer and host of the TV news magazine The Struggle.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How can we help in an effort to change the mascot of a\u00a0North\u00a0Haven\u00a0(Conn.) high school away from the \u201cIndians\u201d?
