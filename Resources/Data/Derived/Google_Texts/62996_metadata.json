This will free up at least $10 million in cap space heading into the 2017-2018 season. However, before we start looking too far ahead, let's look at what Celtics General Manager Danny Ainge has done during this season to acquire assets and financial flexibility for the near future.\n\nThe Celtics are currently in the top twelve in the NBA in points per game (#10), assists (#3), and rebounds per game (#12).\n\nFor a Breakdown of Celtics Salary Commitments Over Next 3 Season, SEE GRAPHS BELOW:\n\nOn Thursday, Ainge was able to deal Austin Rivers to the Los Angeles Clippers for a 2017 second round pick. Doesn't sound like a lot? It is when you look at the next four years of draft picks that the Celtics currently hold.\n\nDraft Picks Galore\n\nThis June, the Celtics could have as many as four first-round draft picks. Including their own, the Celtics also have the Dallas Maverick's first round pick from the Rajon Rondo trade, and they have an un-protected first round pick from the Los Angeles Clippers when they gave them head coach Doc Rivers.\n\nWhen they traded Brandan Wright, they received a protected first round pick from the Phoenix Suns. The Suns' first rounder is from the Minnesota Timberwolves. If the Timberwolves fall between picks #1-#12, the Wolves get to keep their pick. If they fall past #12, the Celtics get it as a first-rounder. The same goes for 2015-2016 season. If this pick is not used by the Celtics in the first round of the next two seasons, then Boston receives a second round pick from Minnesota in 2016 and 2017.\n\nIn 2016, the Celtics will have their own first round pick, the first round pick from the Brooklyn Nets (from the Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett trade), their own second round pick, and the second round pick from the Mavericks.\n\nThe Celtics also received a future unprotected first round pick from the Memphis Grizzlies when they traded Jeff Green\n\nIn the next two drafts, the Celtics could have as many as ten draft picks.\n\nSalary Cap Space Through the Roof\n\nFor the 2014-2015, the Celtics have the 8th lowest salary commitment in the league at just over $63 million. The league average is $74.5 million.\n\nAs it stands right now the Celtics have nearly $30 million coming off the books after this current season. However, some of that money will be used to retain players like Marcus Thornton and Jae Crowder. As seen below, the Celtics salary breakdown for next season is roughly $37 million (the chart also shows Austin Rivers' $3.5 million. He was traded on Thursday).\n\nAfter the 2015-2016 season, the Celtics will look to re-sign Jared Sullinger for at least $10-$15 million per season. They may even look to re-sign Evan Turner and Tyler Zeller. Even with those three re-signings, and the possible return of Thornton and Crowder, the majority of the Celtics players in two years will still be under rookie contracts.\n\nThis will allow Ainge the flexibility to sign veterans, trade draft picks, or allow his core talent to continue to grow together while still staying under the salary cap.\n\nRelated Slideshow: Greatest Players in Brown Basketball History\n\nPrev Next Cedric Kuakumensah Class of 2016 Cedric Kuakumensah is the only player in Ivy League history to score 1,000 points, grab 900 rebounds and block 200 shots.
