Gen. Ben Hodges, commander U.S. Army Europe, speaking to reporters in Ukraine\u2019s capital city on Tuesday.\n\nOn May 16, the Ukrainian Aydar Battalion captured two Russian soldiers, Capt. Yevgeny Yerofeyev and Sgt. Aleksandr Aleksandrov, after a firefight with a Russian reconnaissance unit near the town of Shchastya in eastern Ukraine. One Ukrainian soldier was killed in the battle, according to Ukrainian media reports, and two more were killed in separate attacks the same day.\n\nBoth captured Russians were part of a Spetsnaz (special forces) unit under GRU (Russian military intelligence) control, and are from Tolyatti, Russia.\n\nIn a video posted to YouTube by Anton Gerashchenko, a member of the Ukrainian Parliament, Aleksandrov said he had been operating inside Ukraine since March 6.\n\nThe Kremlin continues to deny that Russian soldiers are fighting in Ukraine, referring to Yerofeyev and Aleksandrov as \u201cformer\u201d Russian soldiers.\n\n\u201cWe and the Defense Ministry on many occasions have said repeatedly that there are no Russian troops in Donbas,\u201d Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, said at a Monday press conference.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Press Service of the Russian Government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nHodges commended Ukraine\u2019s transparency and ethical treatment of the captured soldiers, specifically referencing the immediate alerting of OSCE monitors and the medical care given to Aleksandrov and Yerofeyev, who were both wounded prior to their capture.\n\n\u201cThis is another example of the professional conduct of the Ukrainian government,\u201d Hodges said. \u201cAnd this points to the importance of the OSCE being allowed to conduct the monitoring mission.\u201d\n\nThe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is the multinational group charged with monitoring the Ukraine conflict\u2019s cease-fire. The OSCE\u2019s monitoring mission in Ukraine comprises 459 monitors from 42 participating countries\u2014including Ukraine, Russia and the United States.\n\n\u201cThe monitoring by OSCE is essential,\u201d Hodges said. \u201cOn the Ukrainian side of the line of contact, it\u2019s almost completely transparent. \u2026 On the Russian-led separatist side there are large areas where we don\u2019t have OSCE monitors and that makes it difficult to have confidence in what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nAccording to U.S. and Ukrainian officials, the recent capture of Russian soldiers inside Ukraine is concrete proof that the Russian military has an active combat role in the Ukraine conflict, which is a violation of the Feb. 12 cease-fire.\n\n\u201cDespite statements by the Russian leadership about the lack of Russian troops in the occupied territory, now we have undeniable evidence of their presence,\u201d Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Viktor Muzhenko said to reporters Monday in Kyiv.\n\nRussia\u2019s alleged violation of the truce has raised fears that the Ukraine conflict, which has gone down in intensity since the cease-fire, might escalate again this summer. In particular, U.S. officials have voiced concerns that a buildup of Russian personnel and equipment inside separatist-controlled territory and along Ukraine\u2019s border suggest a combined Russian-separatist offensive is upcoming.\n\n\u201cRussian forces used the opportunities presented by the recent lull in fighting to reset and reposition while protecting their gains,\u201d NATO Supreme Commander Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove said in testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee on April 30.\n\n\u201cMany of their actions are consistent with preparations for another offensive,\u201d he added.\n\nHodges, who was in Ukraine to evaluate the U.S. Army\u2019s training of the Ukrainian National Guard in western Ukraine, said U.S. soldiers do not plan to leave the country early if fighting escalates.\n\n\u201cEverybody that wears a uniform wants to see the successful implementation of the Minsk agreement,\u201d he said, referring to the Feb. 12 cease-fire signed in the Belarusian capital of Minsk.\n\n\u201cI am very confident in the quality and capabilities of what Ukraine is doing right now, and our soldiers are focused on their training mission.\u201d\n\nAbout 300 soldiers from the U.S. Army\u2019s 173rd Airborne Brigade are in Yavoriv, Ukraine (about 800 miles from the front lines) training the Ukrainian National Guard in an exercise called Fearless Guardian.\n\nThe training began April 20 and is expected to last six months.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The top US Army commander in Europe said he was \u2018impressed\u2019 with Ukraine\u2019s treatment of two captured Russian special forces commandos.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The top US Army commander in Europe said he was \u2018impressed\u2019 with Ukraine\u2019s treatment of two captured Russian special forces commandos.", "title": "US General Praises Ukraine\u2019s Treatment of Captured Russians", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Hodges.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-21T10:39:45+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1BausI4"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The top US Army commander in Europe said he was \u2018impressed\u2019 with Ukraine\u2019s treatment of two captured Russian special forces commandos.", "title": "US General Praises Ukraine\u2019s Treatment of Captured Russians", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Hodges.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "europe", "published_time": "2015-05-19T17:39:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-21T10:39:45+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ukraine, cease-fire, Russia, Putin, NATO, U.S. Army, Spetsnaz, Hodges, Yavoriv"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb7e8\"", "article_summary": "The Kremlin continues to deny that Russian soldiers are fighting in Ukraine, referring to Yerofeyev and Aleksandrov as \u201cformer\u201d Russian soldiers.\nOn May 16, the Ukrainian Aydar Battalion captured two Russian soldiers, Capt.\nBoth captured Russians were part of a Spetsnaz (special forces) unit under GRU (Russian military intelligence) control, and are from Tolyatti, Russia.\nAleksandr Aleksandrov, after a firefight with a Russian reconnaissance unit near the town of Shchastya in eastern Ukraine.\nThe OSCE\u2019s monitoring mission in Ukraine comprises 459 monitors from 42 participating countries\u2014including Ukraine, Russia and the United States."}
