In addition to state investigations, a federal investigation was immediately launched.\n\nDuring an extended press conference on Thursday, Christie apologized for what happened, announced that he had fired at least one close aide, and took responsibility for the whole mess even though he claimed he had prior knowledge of the events in question.\n\nIn a CNN interview that took place Christie\u2019s press conference, Don Lemon (see embed above) asked the Congresswoman about her fellow Democrat Barack Obama who said he was unaware about the NSA spying, or about the Obamacare website, or that you couldn\u2019t keep your health plan or doctor. \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between Christie not knowing and the president not knowing?\u201d Lemon wondered.\n\nLemon omitted mentioning, for example, the Fast and Furious gunrunning scandal, the Benghazi terrorist attack (both of which resulted in American lives lost), or the IRS targeting of Tea Party groups or other political opponents of the administration that some have argued constituted voter suppression in the 2012 presidential election.\n\nWasserman Schultz, who initially appeared stunned that she would be on the receiving end of a tough question on CNN, responded that the president\u2019s lack of knowledge in the siutations Lemon cited revolved around \u201cpolicy issues\u201d while the Christie situation is \u201ca scandal that leads right to his office.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, The Wall Street Journal called attention to the mainstream media\u2019s generally indifferent attitude toward the Obama scandals as opposed to the feeding frenzy now going on with Chris Christie\u2019s so-called Bridge-gate. Noting that Christie\u2019s \u201ccontrition contrasts so sharply with President Obama\u2019s handling of the tax agency\u2019s abuse of political opponents and his reluctance to fire anyone other than a military general for anything,\u201d the WSJ went out to say that \u2026\n\n\u201cYet compared to using the IRS against political opponents during an election campaign, closing traffic lanes for four days is jaywalking. We raise this mostly because our media friends have been complicit in dismissing the IRS abuses, and for that matter every other legal abuse during the Obama years. The exception is the Edward Snowden theft of National Security Agency documents, which so far have exposed not a single example of law-breaking.\u201d\n\n[cartoon by A.F. Branco]\n\nAs a digression from the Chris Christie Bridge-gate scandal, you might remember that Boardwalk Empire season 3 had a somewhat similar, or not, key plot element in which Nucky Thompson\u2019s bootlegging rivals blocked a road between Atlantic City, N.J., and New York City.\n\n[thumbnail image credit: Nightscream]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Is there a difference when President Obama denies knowledge of any scandals in his administration versus when New Jersey Governor Chris Christie does the same", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Is there a difference when President Obama denies knowledge of any scandals in his administration versus when New Jersey Governor Chris Christie does the same", "title": "Top Dem: Obama Denials Okay, Christie Denials Not Okay [Video]", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1092233/top-dem-obama-denials-okay-christie-denials-not-okay-video/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Chris-Christie-wikipedia.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-12T16:55:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-16T13:43:43+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Chris-Christie-wikipedia.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-01-12T16:55:59+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "bridgegate,bridgegate chris christie,chirs christie scandal,chris christie,debbie wasserman schultz,fort lee new jersey,george washington bridge,obama scandals,politics", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Chris-Christie-wikipedia.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Is there a difference when President Obama denies knowledge of any scandals in his administration versus when New Jersey Governor Chris Christie does the same"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceba9\"", "article_summary": "Is there a difference when President Obama denies knowledge of any scandals in his administration versus when New Jersey Governor Chris Christie does the same thing?\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between Christie not knowing and the president not knowing?\u201d Lemon wondered.\nWe raise this mostly because our media friends have been complicit in dismissing the IRS abuses, and for that matter every other legal abuse during the Obama years.\nChristie, a Republican, is engulfed in a scandal about the shutting down of three lanes of the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, N.J., in September, which caused a huge traffic jam.\nThe exception is the Edward Snowden theft of National Security Agency documents, which so far have exposed not a single example of law-breaking.\u201d[cartoon by A.F."}
