Behind her is applicant Richard Merikle, left, and audience member Joe Larson, center.\n\nMore people want to be on the Snoqualmie Valley Hospital\u2019s board of commissioners now, than ever before.\n\nFinance professionals, business owners, veterans, and one former Valley nurse among them, seven applicants for King County Public Hospital District\u2019s open Position 3 seat aired their ambitions Thursday night, March 6, in open interviews with the board. That is more interest than commission president Joan Young has ever seen for the organization, which has begun construction of a new campus on Snoqualmie Ridge.\n\n\u201cWe want this to be as fair as possible,\u201d said commissioner Dave Speikers.\n\nThe order of interviewees was randomly drawn from a hat. Candidates left the room then returned in order, so that none got a chance to preview the questions.\n\nCandidates, Robert Merikle, Emma Heron, Kevin Hauglie, Herschel Backues, Darryl Wright, Sandy Kangas and Ryan Roberts each had the chance to explain their interests in the hospital commission. An eighth, former Snoqualmie Police Chief Jim Schaeffer, applied but was unable to attend Thursday\u2019s interviews.\n\n\u201cGreat answers, good candidates,\u201d said Speikers afterward.\n\n\u201cI learned a lot tonight, said board member Gene Pollard. \u201cWe would all agree that the biggest impediment to a true democratic system is apathy. What\u2019s great is you guys are here, not apathetic, engaged. Every one of you, whether you win or lose on this little competition, have a lot to offer to the hospital district, and health care in the Valley.\u201d\n\nDistrict bylaws don\u2019t define how the board chooses a replacement. So, after 70 minutes of listening and a short discussion, the four board members agreed to each write down their top three choices, then count the results. The board will discuss the two finalists and vote at their March 20 meeting.\n\nIf the board can\u2019t come to an agreement on its new member, the matter rests with the King County Council.\n\nRobert Merikle\n\nEmployed by a biotech company, Merikle touted his work in finance and with non-profits. The Snoqualmie resident is an Irvine, Calif., native, who wants to add to the board while learning from it. A Snoqualmie Parks Board member, Merikle applied because of the big changes coming for the hospital.\n\n\u201cThis is your one bite at the apple,\u201d he said. \u201cFive, 10, 25 years down the road, the decisions made now will affect the community. I think this is an exciting time to join, and hopefully make an impact.\u201d\n\nAsked by Pollard what his unique contribution would be, \u201cDefinitely, without a doubt, it\u2019s the finance side of things,\u201d Merikle replied. He works to maximize shareholder value.\n\n\u201cWith non-profits, success is never measured by how much money you can make,\u201d he added. \u201cI enjoy the strategic, philosophical decisions on how you measure and achieve success.\n\n\u201cMy philosophy is that you need some type of disagreement,\u201d Merikle said. \u201cIf you\u2019re just sitting there rubber-stamping everything, you\u2019re not having as meaningful a conversation as you need to.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nEmma Heron\n\nHeron, a Snoqualmie Ridge resident, threw her hat in the ring to help the elderly, vulnerable and underserved residents of the Valley.\n\n\u201cMy goal is to continue to deliver quality health care that respects the dignity of everyone in the community,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I am appointed, I will do my due diligence to make sure all work is transparent and good. I am encouraged to learn, listen, think and plan for future work, which I hope will meet success.\u201d\n\nHeron shared her experience on non-profit boards to help fight kidney disease, reduce violence, and advocate for the rights of the elderly.\n\n\u201cBoards are not perfect,\u201d Heron said. \u201cEveryone has their own opinions. The key to making sure everything is in harmony is to listen to one another and to weigh all the possibilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important to remember is listening to community, what their needs are,\u201d Heron added.\n\n\u201cAssess what\u2019s out there, analyze the risk and involve the community.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin Hauglie\n\nThis Fall City resident and former commissioner wants his seat back. Hauglie is seeking position 3 because its former occupant, Pollard, challenged him for re-election and won in an unprecedented commissioner-versus-commissioner election last fall.\n\nHauglie said he wants to be an active participant, and see the construction of the new hospital completed.\n\n\u201cI always have a posture of being approachable,\u201d he said. \u201cAnybody who has questions can come and get the truth. It may not be what they want to hear, but they\u2019ll get the truth. As public officials and as human beings, we have an obligation to do that.\u201d\n\nHauglie emphasized his nine years of experience on the board, a time when the hospital\u2019s revenues rose from $300,000 a month to $2.5 million.\n\nAs a commissioner, Hauglie said he learned \u201cto be patient, to listen to your executive team, your fellow commissioners.... We control a lot of money\u2014we\u2019ve got a $30 million budget. We\u2019re the second biggest employer in the Valley. We touch a lot of lives. It\u2019s a huge responsibility.\u201d\n\nAsked about his perception of the district, Hauglie called it a fundamental, basic service that the community needs to support and use.\n\n\u201cWe have a hospital that has through challenging times made some very difficult decisions,\u201d Hauglie said. As a commissioner, he would keep an open door, continue pushing for the best medical practices, and improve public perceptions. \u201cWe have an obligation to continue to move that perception of reality in a positive way.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHerschel Backues\n\nAsked why he applied, Backues, a 30-year Valley resident, shared his rocky history with the district.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming from a different perspective,\u201d he told the board. \u201cI\u2019ve been attending these meetings for over 20 years. In that period, it seems like there\u2019s always friction. I\u2019d like to smooth that out.\u201d\n\nBackues admitted to his negative feeling for the new hospital in the past, when he called it unnecessary due to Swedish Hospital\u2019s proximity in Issaquah.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t apologize for my attitude before,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve had a change of heart over this. Now, my objectives are to make this hospital work.\n\n\u201cContracts are signed. Ground\u2019s broken. The hospital is going to be built.\u201d\n\nBackues touted business experience, how he overcomes issues \u201cwith cool head and quiet demeanor,\u201d and looks at the big picture.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t go along to get along but I can be persuaded and I do persuasion myself. I enjoy it.\u201d\n\nAs an active district resident, he recalled bringing in detailed concerns before the board, only to be brusquely halted when his three minutes for public comment were up.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that all about?\u201d asked Backues, who challenged the board to truly listen to constituents\u2019 concerns.\n\nWhen it comes before the board, it\u2019s \u2018Follow the rules and sit down.\u2019 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary,\u201d he added. \u201cSo you\u2019ve got to spend an extra 20 minutes? People come here in their excitement and interest in the hospital.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDarryl Wright\n\nWright, a Snoqualmie resident, rattled off a host of qualifications: Master\u2019s degrees in organizational development and public administration, lesser degrees in sports medicine and health sciences, work in private, public and non-profit sectors, military service as a liaison with medical facilities in Iraq, family traditions. He\u2019s already deeply involved, as chairman of the Snoqualmie planning commission, a board member of the Snoqualmie Valley Hospital Foundation, as a Community Emergency Response Team member, and as a Rotarian.\n\n\u201cI have a track record that shows I want to be involved,\u201d he said. \u201cI love giving back to the community.\u201d\n\nWright said he seeks fiscal sustainability, enhanced community trust and ensured local health and well-being.\n\nHe recognized, from the results of last fall\u2019s election, which brought in the newcomer, Dariel Norris, and ousted Hauglie in place of Pollard, \u201chow the residents within our district view the hospital district and what they want to see going froward. I want to honor that.\u201d As a commissioner, he said he would make sure everyone is heard.\n\nHe espoused collaboration and partnerships, and would bring college training classes to the hospital campus. Wright said he also wants to partner with the Veterans Administration to offer health programs through the hospital.\n\n\u201cOut of the 39,000 residents in our district, there are 2,750 veterans,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also would create a new hospital committee for civic engagement and outreach.\n\n\n\n\n\nSandy Kangas\n\nKangas, of North Bend, would bring her background as a businesswoman and nurse into play on the commission.\n\nKangas says she has a passion for rural health care.\n\n\u201cI would hope to bring to the board more consciousness than I currently see about quality,\u201d she said.\n\nKangas believes she would be more involved, and approachable to staff and the community.\n\n\u201cThe board wants to be involved in the hospital in a positive way, giving their expertise in a way that enhances the hospital,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one\u2019s talking to you.\u201d\n\nKangas contrasted herself, saying she\u2019s more at home in that setting, and would bring information forward: \u201cI can get the goods.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan Roberts\n\nRoberts moved to Snoqualmie with his young family. He sees the hospital as part of their future.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of young families here like us,\u201d he said. They need access to first-class health care.\n\n\u201cMany of us were excited, happy that this new facility is being built,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to convert some doubts into a real plus for this Valley.\u201d\n\nA former naval aviator who now works in commercial insurance and risk management, Roberts said he advises hospital clients and understands the industry, with a working knowledge of the Affordable Care Act and how it affects the industry.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to need to bring me up to speed on the business of health care,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis district is at a tactical juncture,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge opportunity in how we\u2019re going to capitalize on that shiny new building. Right now, we\u2019re capturing 10 percent of the Valley\u2019s health care spend. If we can move that needle by 1 percent, that\u2019s an additional $3 million to the topline.\n\n\u201cYou have new participants in the system,\u201d he said. This year and next year, as you have Medicare and Medicaid take-up, you\u2019re going to have a new customer at your front door\u2014people who have never had an insurance policy before, but have a lot of high-cost co-pays\u2026. What\u2019s the board going to do, strategically?\u201d\n\nIf selected, commissioners must attend regular monthly board meetings and committee meetings. Commissioners are paid $114 for each day or portion of a day spent in official meetings of the district.\n\nThe chosen applicant would run for election in 2015.\n\n\u2022 Learn about the Snoqualmie Valley Hospital Commission at www.snoqualmiehospital.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "More people want to be on the Snoqualmie Valley Hospital\u2019s board of commissioners now, than ever before.
