Their inclusion is the result of gradual changes in the West Bank in recent years.\n\nSome gender barriers have fallen, with a few women assuming posts as mayors, judges and Cabinet ministers or starting their own businesses. At the same time, unemployment is on the rise, and families are more open to women entering non-traditional jobs if it means another paycheck.\n\nWomen make up just 3 percent of 30,000 members of the Palestinian police and other security agencies in the West Bank, but there\u2019s a push to recruit more, said Brig. Rashideh Mughrabi, in charge of gender issues in the National Security Forces.\n\nThe female Presidential Guards recruits were picked from last year\u2019s graduating class of Independence University, a four-year security academy in Jericho that trains future officers.\n\nFor graduate Kurum Saad, the appeal was immediate. As a female officer, her traditional role would have been in administration, but she wanted adventure.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to sit in an office,\u201d the 23 year old said. \u201cSince I was a little girl, I loved shooting and sports.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Saad and the others in her group put on black combat boots, camouflage uniforms and pulled black ski masks over the headscarves to show journalists what they\u2019d learned in their special training.\n\nSeveral women, including non-swimmers, were asked to jump into a pool as a show of courage. They dove in in full uniform, including boots, and one had to be pulled out by a lifeguard.\n\nSix women, including Saad, rappelled down the six-story tower in pairs. Saad said she excels at sharp shooting but for months was terrified of heights. She said that during training in Jordan with local commandos, she overcame her fear. Sunday, she swiftly made her way down, smiling as she touched ground.\n\nSaad said she relishes her role of opening doors for other women. Her father is proud of her and her little sister is eager to join the Guards, she said.\n\nAll but two of the female Guards, including Saad, wore black headscarves, reflecting a growing trend among Palestinian women to cover their hair because of tradition, Muslim religious observance or social pressure.\n\nAs the women performed their drills at the walled Presidential Guards training complex in Jericho \u2014 having been called back from a break for the occasion \u2014 hundreds of young men waited in line outside in the brutal desert sun.", "article_metadata": {"description": "First women joining Palestinian commando unit", "title": "First women joining Palestinian commando unit", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "First women joining Palestinian commando unit", "title": "First women joining Palestinian commando unit", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/04/07/first_women_joining_palestinian_commando_unit/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/aptopix-mideast-palestinians-commandos-in-headscarves.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "First women joining Palestinian commando unit", "title": "First women joining Palestinian commando unit", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/aptopix-mideast-palestinians-commandos-in-headscarves.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Karin Laub and Mohammed Daraghmeh", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd0ce\"", "article_summary": "Six women, including Saad, rappelled down the six-story tower in pairs.\nSeveral women, including non-swimmers, were asked to jump into a pool as a show of courage.\nAll but two of the female Guards, including Saad, wore black headscarves, reflecting a growing trend among Palestinian women to cover their hair because of tradition, Muslim religious observance or social pressure.\nThe female Presidential Guards recruits were picked from last year\u2019s graduating class of Independence University, a four-year security academy in Jericho that trains future officers.\nThe 22 future commandos are trailblazers in a still largely male-dominated society, set to become the first female members of the Presidential Guards, a Palestinian elite force of 2,600 men."}
