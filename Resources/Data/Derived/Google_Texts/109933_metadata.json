She will face off against 4 term incumbent Washington politician Dave Loebsack this fall.\n\nDr. Miller-Meeks had the following to say on winning the nomination:\n\n\u201cTogether we sent a clear message to Washington that Iowa is tired of the dysfunction and ready to get to work addressing the challenges we face like implementing better health care reforms, increasing take-home pay, and restoring accountability in government.\n\n\u201cGrowing up poor and being the first person in my family to go to college \u2013 or medical school \u2013 I know what it\u2019s like to work hard in the pursuit of the American dream. Unfortunately, our federal government is putting up too many barriers that are getting in the way of the next poor girl who wants a better life. Wages are stagnant and there are not enough jobs being created. The latest road block is the new rule from the Obama Administration that will increase the cost of electricity for Iowa\u2019s middle class. The Affordable Care Act is anything but affordable and leading to higher premiums, cancelled care, and reduced employee paychecks, hours, and jobs. We need economic policies from Washington that complement what is working here in Iowa including better health care reforms that are patient-centered and preserve the doctor/patient relationship.\n\n\u201cWe also know Washington is out of control and needs to be held accountable \u2013 especially for the current travesty with veterans health care. As a 24 year Army veteran, it makes me angry that our veterans would be treated this way. It is our solemn duty to take care of our veterans who have sacrificed so much for us.\n\n\u201cThank you to everyone who has helped get me this far. Our victory was just the first step and we have much more work to do, but I look forward to the coming months meeting with Iowans, listening to their concerns, and talking about my solutions to the challenges we face.\u201d\n\nDr. Miller-Meeks is wasting no time starting the general election campaign. She will join Governor Terry Branstand, Lieutenant Governor Kim Reynolds and the rest of the Republican ticket as they travel through Iowa\u2019s Second Congressional District today making stops in Oskaloosa, Ottumwa, Mount Pleasant, Burlington, and Davenport.", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2836\"", "article_summary": "OTTUMWA, IOWA \u2013 Last night, Dr. Mariannette Miller-Meeks clinched the Republican nomination for Iowa\u2019s Second Congressional District against State Representative Mark Lofgren of Muscatine and Matt Waldren of Eddyville.\n\u201cWe also know Washington is out of control and needs to be held accountable \u2013 especially for the current travesty with veterans health care.\nWe need economic policies from Washington that complement what is working here in Iowa including better health care reforms that are patient-centered and preserve the doctor/patient relationship.\nIt is our solemn duty to take care of our veterans who have sacrificed so much for us.\nAs a 24 year Army veteran, it makes me angry that our veterans would be treated this way."}
