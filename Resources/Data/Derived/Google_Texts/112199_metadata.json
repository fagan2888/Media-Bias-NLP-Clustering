Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) this week introduced a bill that would require the military\u2019s health insurance program to cover breastfeeding equipment and counseling, just as the Affordable Care Act mandates for most insurance plans.\n\nUnder the health law, widely known as Obamacare, insurance companies must cover breast-pump rental or give the equipment to new mothers, in addition to providing lactation counseling and support. But the military\u2019s coverage, TRICARE, leaves armed-forces personnel and their spouses to pay the full costs for those services out of pocket unless their children are born prematurely and meet other criteria.\n\nSen.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)\n\n\u201cAs someone who was a single, working mother, I know first-hand the importance of comprehensive, affordable health care when caring for a new child,\u201d McCaskill said. \u201cNew mothers in the military and military spouses deserve access to the services consistent with coverage available in the private sector.\u201d\n\nTRICARE is not subject to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandates affecting private insurance. As a result, the law\u2019s provisions on breastfeeding services do not extend to the military program.\n\nThe National Military Family Association has backed McCaskill\u2019s bill, which the senator introduced on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cOne of our association\u2019s top priorities is ensuring that military families, who have sacrificed greatly in support of our nation, have access to high quality health care benefits on par with civilian coverage,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cWe thank Senator McCaskill for her efforts to bring TRICARE in line with Affordable Care Act coverage requirements for breastfeeding support.\u201d\n\nTRICARE also does not cover corrective contact lenses and eyeglasses for the children and spouses of military personnel, except for limited conditions such as infantile glaucoma and misshapen corneas. The plan does include routine eye exams for kids and adults.\n\nThe health law mandates coverage of pediatric vision care for private insurance. Comprehensive eye exams and corrective lenses must be included with individual and small-group plans such as those sold on the federal health-insurance exchanges, according to guidance from the American Academy of Opthamology.\n\nFollow Josh Hicks on Twitter, Facebook or Google+.
