While the sequestered amount will drop from $986 billion to $967 billion, it is expected to squeeze agencies even more as they will have run out of creative methods of finding funds.\n\nChanos, the founder of hedge fund Kynikos Associates, was not available for comment. Kynikos has around $6 billion in assets under management.\n\nLorne Gorber, global spokesman for CGI, said he has not read the report from Chanos and has been in touch with the firm asking for a copy of it. \"I'm still trying to get my hands on the referenced 10-page memo,\" he said.\n\n\"I can assure you we've never had a conversation with him, though I invited him to call me when I sent him a note to ask for his report.\"\n\nGorber defended CGI's performance. \"Fundamentally, our results are there and I think investors should analyze them for what they are and do their due diligence the same way that we would if we were buying a company,\" he said.\n\n\"Ourselves, we just bought $100 million worth of stock last week,\" he added.\n\nAs of Tuesday, about 50.8 million shares traded of CGI's 277.47 million outstanding shares - 18.3 percent of the float - were being shorted, according to data firm Markit.\n\nCGI Group has been an investor favorite for nearly five years, helped by its acquisition of European rival Logica. But headlines on troubles at the federal health insurance website, a key component of President Barack Obama's healthcare reform, are drawing growing attention to the company, often called Canada's most valuable technology firm.\n\n\"Media attention on CGI's role in the 'Obamacare' healthcare exchange website has been negative,\" Paul Treiber, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a reaction to the Chanos news. \"However, CEO Mike Roach on CGI's Q4/F13 call in November indicated CGI's pipeline is continuing to expand and it is receiving support from clients, which to us indicates that the reputational impact to CGI's business may be limited.\"\n\nRBC has an \"outperform\" recommendation on CGI shares.\n\n(Additional reporting by Leah Schnurr in Toronota; Editing by Jan Paschal and Leslie Adler)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jennifer Ablan", "Author": "Jennifer Ablan", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Prominent short-seller Jim Chanos has taken a major short position in shares of CGI Group Inc (GIBa.TO) (GIB.N), the parent of CGI Federal, which is the main contractor behind the U.S. government's glitch-plagued HealthCare.gov website.", "title": "CGI Group shares drop after Chanos makes big short bet", "image": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20131204&t=2&i=817439823&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=CBRE9B31I9600", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Finance", "sailthru.tags": "US, INVESTING, CGI, CHANOS", "sailthru.title": "CGI Group shares drop after Chanos makes big short bet", "keywords": "US,INVESTING,CGI,CHANOS,Picture available,Hedge Funds,Banking and Investment Services (TRBC),Major News,Business : Public Services (Legacy),Equities Markets,Company News,Canada,IT Services and Consulting (TRBC),Volatile Shares / Hot Stocks", "DCSext.ContentType": "Article", "news_keywords": "US;INVESTING;CGI;CHANOS;Picture available;Hedge Funds;Banking and Investment Services (TRBC);Major News;Business : Public Services (Legacy);Equities Markets;Company News;Canada;IT Services and Consulting (TRBC);Volatile Shares / Hot Stocks", "WT.cg_n": "Finance -
