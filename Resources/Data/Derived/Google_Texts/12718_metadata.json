And being as providers currently face mounting pressure to increase quality while maximizing cash flow and reducing costs (in addition to preparing for the conversion to ICD-10), it couldn\u2019t have come at a more crucial time.\n\nNo other technology has the power to impact a healthcare practice\u2019s financial health like its practice management system (PMS). The PMS is the epicenter of all activities related to revenue generation and cost containment, and it will be the key to a successful transition to ICD-10. But historically, there have been few ways for practices to thoroughly assess these systems to ensure that they have the capacity to not only handle the job at hand, but also produce compliance with the myriad rules and regulations governing the practice\u2019s activities.\n\nThe Practice Management System Accreditation Program (PMSAP) was formally launched at the fall conference of the Workgroup for Electronic Data Interchange (WEDI). At the conference, and at the co-located Healthcare Administrative Technology Association (HATA) national meeting, I led two panel discussions with industry leaders to talk about the significance of the program and the impact it will have on the industry.\n\nFor the first time, vendors that develop software to handle the administrative side of a physician practice \u2014 including everything from scheduling to revenue cycle management to monthly report generation \u2014 will be able to test their systems against standards developed by industry peers.\n\nA program like this is long overdue, according to Robert Tennant, senior policy advisor for the Medical Group Management Association. \u201cThrough HIPAA and the Affordable Care Act Section 1104, we have an excellent array of administrative simplification standards and operating rules,\u201d Tennant said. \u201cBut what we are finding is (that) many of the practices are unable to take advantage of those standards because their PMS software in the practice doesn\u2019t have the capability.\u201d\n\nMGMA worked with the American Medical Association for several years to identify criteria that should be tested in practice management systems to give providers the confidence they need during the system selection process. All that was left, he said, was to find an organization able and willing to take on the role of overseeing the accreditation process. Along with WEDI, they worked out a deal for EHNAC to take on that role and create the jointly developed program.\n\n\u201cEHNAC has such a strong reputation in the industry, (and) we hope that the vendors will begin to see this as a huge opportunity themselves,\u201d Tennant said.\n\nPMSAP provides a comprehensive third-party review of PMS vendors in the areas of privacy, security, mandated standards and operating rules, and key system functionality. It also assesses privacy and security measures, HIPAA, HITECH, the Omnibus Rule, and requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). The review process also includes technical performance, business processes, and resource management.\n\nHundreds of practice management solutions are in the marketplace today. For providers, ensuring that a chosen system does what needs to be done can be virtually impossible. Providers\u2019 jobs are to practice medicine, not to become experts in the technical requirements of electronic data interchange. They rely on vendors to educate them in these areas, and to ensure the systems are HIPAA-compliant, despite the fact that vendors are not covered entities under HIPAA. Going through this new accreditation process will afford vendors the chance to self-audit their performance.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to rely simply on brochures and sales pitches by vendors,\u201d Tennant said. \u201cWe want a seal of approval.\u201d\n\nGaining it will help vendors ensure:\n\nSoftware meets PPACA, HIPAA, and other regulatory standards and requirements;\n\nSoftware has key functionality such as of portability, interoperability, clinical integration, compliance monitoring, billing, and reporting;\n\nSoftware meets minimum levels of privacy and security standards; and\n\nSoftware will be ready to accept ICD-10 code sets.\n\nTim McMullen, executive director of HATA, the trade group for the practice management system industry, applauded the PMSAP during a recent EHNAC-hosted webinar by saying it \u201cproduces a great benchmark for the practice management software community.\u201d\n\nGaining accreditation will give vendors a competitive advantage, at least initially. Eventually, it will be necessary in order to compete at all, McMullen predicts. Accreditation will start showing up as a requirement in RFI/RFPs, he predicted.\n\nTennant said that once all the vendors have met the baseline standards of features and functions, they can compete on optional \u201cbells-and-whistles\u201d features. \u201cThat could drive down some of the costs and really improve the efficiency of the software,\u201d he said.\n\nMuch like how the electronic health record accreditation program launched by the Certification Commission for Health Information Technology blazed the trail for the meaningful use incentive program, Tennant would like to see the PMSAP mark the first step toward the transformation of the administrative side of healthcare.\n\nMuch of the real savings in healthcare comes from the administrative side. Moving the industry to electronic transactions will have a tremendous impact.\n\nEHNAC will start accepting applications for accreditation in November. Information about the program can be found on the EHNAC website (https://www.ehnac.org/practice-management-system-accreditation-program/). This webinar (https://www.ehnac.org/?webinar=cutting-through-the-competition-pmsap) also provides a more thorough look at the accreditation process, its significance, and its anticipated benefits to the healthcare community.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nLee Barrett is the executive director for EHNAC, the Electronic Healthcare Network Accreditation Commission.
