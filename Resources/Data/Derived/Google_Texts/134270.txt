The Brooklyn Bar’s Foundation Law Committee is about step directly into the historic controversy swirling around “Obamacare,” which is officially known as The Affordable Care Act.

On the evening of Feb. 5, the committee will have experts go into informative detail on “Navigating the Affordable Care Act,” according to Chair Fern Finkel.

Billed as “A program for individuals, professional practitioners and business,” the event will mark yet another occasion when BBA-affiliated leaders ‘go public’ in an effort to reach beyond the bar and help those whose lives are directly effected by the A.C.A.

Finkel will moderate the program featuring Charles J. Newman, whose practice is limited to life, disability, health insurance and employee benefits.

The speaker promises to deal with the trickiest issues dogging proponents of the healthcare revolution.

Among the questions on the agenda are:

–Why am I losing my health insurance plan?

–What are the options available though the “New York State of Health” Marketplace Exchange?

–What are the differences of the health insurance plans offered “on Exchange” and “off Exchange”?

–How do I determine whether my physician participates in an “on Exchange” plan?

–Do I qualify for a premium subside on the Exchange?

–My group insurance plan is being canceled: What are my options?

–How to understand the employee mandate now in effect as well as the employer mandate for 2015.

–How to calculate the full time equivalency test and what does it mean?

The evening will be a bargain for lay people and barristers alike. As President Obama learned when he earnestly but incorrectly stated that “You can keep the insurance you have [under the ACA],” this is a dense and complex creation.

The Foundation Public Forum is a continuing program initiated six years ago by then President Diana Szochet working Finkel. Further information on this special evening can be obtained by contacting BBA Executive Director Avery Okin at [email protected].
