It\u2019s a crash of the Constitution.\n\nHe said: \u201cFive years ago, after nearly a century of talk, decades of trying, a year of bipartisan debate, we finally declared in America health care is not a privilege, but a right for all.\u201d\n\nCue image of Founding Fathers in graves, rolling.\n\nCue image of Founding Fathers in graves, rolling. Share:\n\nHealth. Care. Is. Not. A. Right.\n\nExcept, now it is. And the reverberations due to be heard around the country from this core outcome of the court\u2019s ruling \u2013 6-3, in favor of upholding the subsidies in Obamacare \u2013 are going to be massive. How so? Just take a before-after shot.\n\nOnce upon a time, some guys with some good orating skills and even better writing talents gathered together for some political shop-talk in Philadelphia to see if they could come up with a proper way to inform the King of England they weren\u2019t going to play his reindeer games any more. Idea men were appointed: This \u201cCommittee of Five,\u201d as it was dubbed, included John Adams of Massachusetts, Roger Sherman of Connecticut, Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania, Robert Livingston of New York and Thomas Jefferson of Virginia. Jefferson spent nearly three weeks penning what was to become one of the greatest political policy positions the world\u2019s ever seen, the Declaration of Independence.\n\nAnd among its many simple premises was this powerful phrase \u2013 that governments are instituted to uphold the God-given rights of \u201clife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\u201d\n\nHealth care did not make the list.\n\nBut now, thanks to the Supreme Court, the floodgates of this limited government principle have been thrust wide. As Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his fiery dissent: The court was guilty of \u201cinterpretive jiggery-pokery,\u201d a phrase defined by Merriam-Webster as \u201cdishonest or suspicious activity.\u201d\n\nWhat would be the proper term, I wonder, to describe a court case that now solidifies what many in the patriotic, traditional-minded and conservative-thinking camps of politics and culture fear is a socialist vein creeping into American society?\n\nOh yes \u2013 that\u2019s called Burwellian, a playful little mix of \u201cOrwellian\u201d and the case name, King v. Burwell. And it\u2019s being picked up by Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders, the self-described socialist who is steaming fast and furious ahead to unseat presidential heir apparent Hillary Clinton from her throne. Recent polls, too, find in his favor.\n\nBloomberg Politics just reported: \u201cIn simultaneous surveys, the U.S. senator from Vermont received nearly a quarter of support from likely Democratic caucus and primary voters in the states that host the first presidential nomination balloting early next year, cutting sharply into Clinton\u2019s still-huge lead. The polls suggest substantive and symbolic support for the socialist, as well as a craving among some Democrats for a Clinton rival to rise.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the number of candidates in the Republican presidential field has hit Lucky 13 \u2013 a bevy that will no doubt cause enough infighting to frustrate the few voters left in America whose attention spans aren\u2019t limited to the time-frame of typing a tweet. Can you say disenfranchised? Let\u2019s hope the candidate emerging from primary season is enough of a principled politician \u2026 well, let\u2019s hope, at least, he or she is not a moderate.\n\nBecause moderate in Republican circles of late seems to mean Democratic. And in the Democratic circles, we seem to have an emerging socialist party.\n\nSo to recap: We\u2019ve got a Supreme Court that just threw a dagger at limited government. We\u2019ve got a sitting president who just received a judicial hand-clap for his socialist Obamacare. And we\u2019ve got an emerging Democratic presidential candidate with a self-declared love of socialism and a voter base that finds his message compelling \u2013 and a Republican Party that seems emasculated, at worst, and confused, at best, in how to rein in this entitlement-minded atmosphere.\n\nThe days of America as a republic seem to be reaching their end. So how about a note of inspiration, to turn back the clock and remind who we are? This one from Patrick Henry seems most apt: \u201cI know not what others may choose but, as for me, give me liberty or give me death.\u201d\n\nCheryl Chumley, a writer for WND.com and former news writer for The Washington Times, is also the author of \u201cPolice State USA: How Orwell\u2019s Nightmare Is Becoming Our Reality.\u201d She may be reached at ckchumley@aol.com or through her blog, cherylchumley.blogspot.com.\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
