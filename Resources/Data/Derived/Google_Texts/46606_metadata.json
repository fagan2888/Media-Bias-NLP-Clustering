John Katko, R-Camillus, and Richard Hanna, R-Barneveld, were among only three House Republicans (joining Rep. Bob Dold, R-Ill.) to split with the party in the vote.\n\nThe vote was consistent with the position the three GOP House members took last month when they voted against the Republican repeal bill. Katko and Hanna said Tuesday their position had not changed.\n\nKatko said he wants to change the Affordable Care Act, but refuses to vote for a repeal bill until Republicans come up with a viable replacement.\n\nHanna had different reasons for voting against the repeal. The bill included a measure to cut off federal funding for Planned Parenthood, which he opposes. He called the House effort a meaningless political ploy.\n\n\"As I said earlier this month, the president would veto this bill, and tonight, Congress failed to override that veto,\" Hanna said. \"I voted 'no' on the veto message because this was a political exercise that accomplished nothing.\"\n\nContact Mark Weiner anytime: Email | Twitter | Facebook | 571-970-3751", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Richard Hanna, John Katko, Barack Obama, Congress, health, healthcare law, Obamacare, politics, President Barack Obama, Top News, US News, Washington, news", "title": "Katko, Hanna support President Obama's veto of bill repealing Obamacare", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Katko, Hanna support President Obama\\u0027s veto of bill repealing Obamacare\", \"link\": \"http://www.syracuse.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/02/katko_hanna_support_president_obamas_veto_of_bill_to_repeal_obamacare.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.syracuse.com/home/syr-media/width620/img/opinion_impact/photo/19532937-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"17922461\", \"pub_date\": \"2016-02-03T00:15:50Z\", \"author\": \"Mark Weiner | mweiner@syracuse.com\", \"tags\": [\"@topstory\",\"Barack Obama\",\"Congress\",\"health\",\"healthcare law\",\"Obamacare\",\"politics\",\"President Barack Obama\",\"Top News\",\"US News\",\"Washington\"] }", "twitter": {"description": "House fails to gain two-thirds majority required to override the president's veto.", "creator": "@MarkWeinerDC", "image": "http://image.syracuse.com/home/syr-media/width620/img/opinion_impact/photo/19532937-standard.jpg", "title": "Katko, Hanna support President Obama's veto of bill repealing Obamacare", "site": "@syracusedotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, February 02, 2016,  7:50 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"Katko, Hanna support veto of bill to repeal Obamacare\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.syracuse.com/opinion_impact/photo/hanna-katko-mashupjpg-88b4f7d571b8d1d9.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"mweiner\", \"author_nickname\": \"Mark Weiner | mweiner@syracuse.com\", \"author_id\": \"710\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Politics & Elections\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.syracuse.com/politics/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "syracuse.com", "description": "House fails to gain two-thirds majority required to override the president's veto.", "title": "Katko, Hanna support President Obama's veto of bill repealing Obamacare", "url": "http://www.syracuse.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/02/katko_hanna_support_president_obamas_veto_of_bill_to_repeal_obamacare.html", "image": "http://image.syracuse.com/home/syr-media/width620/img/opinion_impact/photo/19532937-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "syracuse.com", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/MarkWeinerDC"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, February 02, 2016,  7:15 PM", "article_author": "Mark Weiner | mweiner@syracuse.com", "Description": "House fails to gain two-thirds majority required to override the president's veto."}, "article_summary": "\"As I said earlier this month, the president would veto this bill, and tonight, Congress failed to override that veto,\" Hanna said.\nThe House voted 241-186 in a failed effort to gain the two-thirds majority needed to override Obama's veto.\nThe vote was consistent with the position the three GOP House members took last month when they voted against the Republican repeal bill.\nKatko said he wants to change the Affordable Care Act, but refuses to vote for a repeal bill until Republicans come up with a viable replacement.\nU.S. Reps.
