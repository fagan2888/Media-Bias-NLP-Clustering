Clark and his company, Brokers\u2019 Choice of America (BCA). A lower court had ruled against Clark and BCA when it requested access to (\u201cdiscovery\u201d of) the unedited footage for use in its lawsuit against NBC Universal (NBC) and \u201cDateline\u201d employees. The annuity firm had sued the mega-media company for defamation stemming from its \u201cDateline\u201d show on annuities.\n\nThe case will be closely followed not only by the insurance industry but also by the news media.\n\nIn the annuity industry, the case opens up old wounds. The \u201cDateline\u201d segment depicted several instances of purported misrepresentation in annuity sales to seniors. Veteran annuity professionals complained that the broadcast focused only on problems and presented a distorted view of the annuity business, effectively tarnishing the image of the entire industry. Bitter feelings have festered ever since.\n\nAs for the news media, the case peers into protections long afforded to news reporters\u2019 work product and confidential sources. Normally, such material is protected from discovery in legal proceedings, with limited exceptions. The circuit court\u2019s decision, involving an insurance firm\u2019s request for access to certain non-aired news material, could expand those exceptions.\n\nThe case\n\nIt its suit, Clark and BCA had contended that \u201cTricks of the Trade,\u201d a \u201cDateline\u201d segment aired in April 2008, had used innuendo, very selective editing and commentary to present Clark\u2019s statements out of context in order to create a false impression thereby defaming him.\n\nIn the telecast, reporter Chris Hansen showed several vignettes purporting to demonstrate misrepresentation in annuity sales and the calculated use of scare tactics to sell inappropriate products to seniors.\n\nRegarding BCA, Hansen introduced snippets of Clark taken from a two-day seminar he had given in October 2007. The seminar was for insurance brokers attending Annuity University at BCA\u2019s property in Colorado.\n\nThe snippets were filmed via hidden cameras brought in by two producers who had obtained false insurance licenses from Alabama officials, according to the circuit court. The snippets depict Clark as teaching misleading sales tactics to agents, but quoting a \u201cmere 112\u201d of Clark\u2019s own words.\n\nClark and BCA sued in district court for defamation among other reasons. As part of the case, Clark and BCA sought access to the unedited footage and transcripts of the 2007 lectures \u2014 for use in substantiating their claims.\n\nNBC and \u201cDateline\u201d objected to providing the materials on grounds of a newsperson\u2019s privilege under Colorado\u2019s Shield Law. The lower court dismissed the defamation claim, noting that BCA didn't have sufficient facts to \u201cplausibly establish that its aired statements were false.\"\n\nHowever, Clark and BCA appealed to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Colorado. In July, the court reversed the lower court\u2019s dismissal of the defamation claim and remanded the case \u201cfor further proceedings consistent with this judgment.\u201d\n\nAbout the raw footage\n\nThe 41-page circuit court decision covers several points of law raised in the Clark/BCA appeal. But it is the court\u2019s discussion about access to the unedited footage that is raising eyebrows.\n\nBCA had contended that Clark\u2019s seminars, when considered in their entirety, \u201dteach and encourage ethical conduct by presenting a balanced approach to saving and investing, and, while touting the advantages of annuities, emphasize that they are not right for everyone,\u201d wrote Judge Terrence O'Brien on behalf of the three-judge circuit panel.\n\nHowever, NBC did not make the actual footage from the October 2008 seminar available for viewing by judge or jury.\n\n\u201cThe object of discovery \u2014 the original footage \u2014 is the best and perhaps only evidence from which a fact-finder can determine whether \u2018Dateline\u2019s\u2019 portrayal of the substance of what occurred at Annuity University cast Clark\u2019s teachings in such a way as to leave a false impression of them,\u201d O\u2019Brien wrote.\n\nBCA does have a film of a March 2007 seminar that is similar to the October 2007 seminar. However, the court held that this earlier film will not do.\n\n\u201cIt is not the seminar witnessed by the \u2018Dateline\u2019 producers, nor is it the one on which the allegedly false statements in the program were based,\u201d the justice wrote, adding that \u201cBCA would be greatly prejudiced in its ability to prove the defamation claim without access to the unedited film.\u201d\n\nThe court said that while the tape of the March 2007 seminar may have been sufficient to support BCA's complaint, \u201cthis does not mean it will be sufficient to carry the heavy burden of proof required at trial.\"\n\nRegarding \u201cDateline\u2019s\u201d privileged news argument, the court provided detailed commentary. This includes review of the Colorado Supreme Court decision (Gordon v. Boyles) that presents three exceptions that can be used to \u201cdefeat\u201d the general newspersons privilege rule, as well as discussion of First Amendment protections for newspersons who rely on confidential sources.\n\nThe court found that BCA met all three exception requirements and that the case does not involve confidential sources or confidential information. BCA is, it said, \u201conly asking for a copy of the unedited film and it would seem to be the only entity with a colorable claim to confidentiality.\u201d\n\nThe court concluded that BCA\u2019s factual allegations are sufficient to warrant discovery of the unedited film. \u201cThe Colorado statue is a shield, not a sword,\u201d it said.\n\nLinda Koco, MBA, is a contributing editor to AnnuityNews, specializing in life insurance, annuities and income planning.
