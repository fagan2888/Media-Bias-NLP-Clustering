Screening rates are below target rates that the government would like to meet by 2020, and not getting any better.\n\nFor breast and colorectal cancers, screening rates have stayed relatively the same since 2000 and 2010, according to a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published in MMWR in 2015. Meanwhile, screening rates for cervical cancer (think Pap smears) have plummeted since 2010.\n\nThat information may mean more when you consider this: \u201cScreening and early detection are the most important steps you can take to combat cancer,\u201d says Jame Abraham, MD, director of the breast oncology program at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. While he admits that many of the screening tests are far from perfect, they\u2019re still better than nothing.\n\nIf you can catch cancer at in early stage, after all, that's when it's most treatable. \u201cOnce you move into advanced stages, it\u2019s extremely difficult to cure and will be more about symptom management,\u201d he says.\n\nOf the people who aren\u2019t getting proper cancer screening on time, certain populations are more affected, according to the new CDC report. They include Hispanics, African-Americans, Asians, and people with low-income.\n\nTop Obstacles to Getting Cancer Screening\n\nWhat\u2019s holding people back from checking for cancer? The reasons vary, but while finances might be the most obvious, it may not be the most common barrier.\n\n\u201cIn the data we\u2019ve been collecting to understand this problem, financial issues are becoming less of a reason, largely because more people are carrying health insurance under the Affordable Care Act,\u201d says Jacquelyne Bailey, PhD, director of community outreach and patient navigation at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. But even with health insurance, some people who get screened then often can\u2019t afford additional tests or treatment.\n\nWhen it comes to non-financial reasons, both consumers and the healthcare industry are to blame. Dr. Bailey says her data, for instance, indicates that lack of time to get a screening is holding many back, especially if they can\u2019t take time off from work.\n\nMotivation is another issue, she finds, because even if finances aren\u2019t an issue, people need to want to get screened in the first place.\n\nMany people also don\u2019t have a primary care provider who can advise them on what screenings they might need. \u201cAs a result, they may not understand their risk of developing cancer,\u201d says Deborah M. Axelrod, MD, breast cancer surgeon at New York University Langone Medical Center in New York City. Some people may also take a fatalistic view and just decide to risk it.\n\nRELATED: 10 Cancer Screening Tests Women Need to Know About\n\nThe burden of educating the public falls on the healthcare industry, but that\u2019s not always a sure thing, thanks to confusing cancer screening guidelines. \u201cPrimary care physicians are confronted by so many guidelines that there are no standards,\u201d Dr. Axelrod says. \u201cBecause they\u2019re not specialists, it can be confusing to know what guidelines to follow.\u201d\n\nGetting the Cancer Screening You Need\n\nEven with all of these barriers to cancer screening, you can take steps to overcome them. How? Follow these strategies:\n\n1) Learn about your cancer risk. Does your family have a history of cancer or do you have other risk factors that could make you more vulnerable to developing cancer? Knowing this information will give you a better idea of whether or not you should be screened, Axelrod says.\n\n2) Find a primary care physician. Even though cancer screening guidelines can be confusing, a physician who knows your health history, including your inherited risk for cancer, can help advise the screening you may \u2013 or may not \u2013 need, Bailey says. If you can\u2019t get a primary care physician, find a health care professional like a nurse practitioner whom you can trust to ask questions, Axelrod says.\n\n3) Ask about low- or no-cost options for screening. The government often gives you cost breaks for screening, Axelrod says, so ask around to see if you\u2019re eligible.\n\nIn the end, you need to become an empowered patient and take action for your own health, learning what cancer screening tests could benefit you, and then getting them if necessary.\n\nAs Abraham says, when it comes to cancer, \u201cEarly detection could save your life.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "none", "description": "Screening rates for cancer aren\u2019t impressive, so what\u2019s stopping people from getting these life-saving cancer tests?", "og": {"site_name": "EverydayHealth.com", "description": "Screening rates for cancer aren\u2019t impressive, so what\u2019s stopping people from getting these life-saving cancer tests?", "title": "Busting Barriers to Cancer Screening", "url": "http://www.everydayhealth.com/news/busting-barriers-cancer-screening/", "image": "http://images.agoramedia.com/everydayhealth/gcms/Busting-Barriers-to-Cancer-Screening-722x406.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Screening rates for cancer aren\u2019t impressive, so what\u2019s stopping people from getting these life-saving cancer tests?", "title": "Busting Barriers to Cancer Screening", "url": "http://www.everydayhealth.com/news/busting-barriers-cancer-screening/", "image": "http://images.agoramedia.com/everydayhealth/gcms/Busting-Barriers-to-Cancer-Screening-722x406.jpg", "site": "@everydayhealth", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "fb": {"app_id": 135346036490186}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2785\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBecause they\u2019re not specialists, it can be confusing to know what guidelines to follow.\u201dGetting the Cancer Screening You NeedEven with all of these barriers to cancer screening, you can take steps to overcome them.\nRELATED: 10 Cancer Screening Tests Women Need to Know AboutThe burden of educating the public falls on the healthcare industry, but that\u2019s not always a sure thing, thanks to confusing cancer screening guidelines.\nTop Obstacles to Getting Cancer ScreeningWhat\u2019s holding people back from checking for cancer?\nOf the people who aren\u2019t getting proper cancer screening on time, certain populations are more affected, according to the new CDC report.\nWhile he admits that many of the screening tests are far from perfect, they\u2019re still better than nothing."}
