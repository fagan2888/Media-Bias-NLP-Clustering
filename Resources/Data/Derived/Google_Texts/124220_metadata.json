Some buildings offer amenities such as gyms, playgrounds and pools to only their higher-paying tenants. Developers, for their part, say that amenities are a way to lure in tenants willing to pay higher prices, and that offering those same amenities to tenants who pay far less would be problematic.\n\nHowever, the attention surrounding 40 Riverside may spell the end of them.\n\n\u201cThe city has just begun to wake up and see that if we don\u2019t act, this is going to be an increasing problem,\u201d Mark Levine, a member of the New York City Council, told The New York Times. Levine and Johnson are working on legislation to expand the city\u2019s anti-discrimination code to include rent-regulated tenants.\n\nBut some developers are defending the practice of limiting amenities to certain tenants.\n\nDavid Von Spreckelsen, senior vice president at Toll Brothers, another company that specializes in luxury residencies (complete with poor doors), told The Real Deal, \u201cNo one ever said the goal was full integration of these populations.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt\u2019s unfair to expect very high-income homeowners who paid a fortune to live in their building to have to be in the same boat as low-income renters, who are very fortunate to live in a new building in a great neighborhood.\u201d\n\n\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Income inequality has dominated Democrats\u2019 political rhetoric across the country, with", "title": "In NYC, Front Doors Are for the One Percent", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/22/NYC-Front-Doors-Are-One-Percent", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02122013_Dollar_City_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/22/NYC-Front-Doors-Are-One-Percent", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02122013_Dollar_City_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Income inequality has dominated Democrats\u2019 political rhetoric across the country, with", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe46ce\"", "article_summary": "There are many luxury high rises in New York City that cater to wealthy people, yet also house rent-regulated tenants.\nThe front doors, meanwhile, will be reserved for wealthy tenants only.\nIncome inequality has dominated Democrats\u2019 political rhetoric across the country, with politicians in Washington and on the campaign trail introducing plans to narrow the growing gulf between the rich and the poor.\n\u201cThe city has just begun to wake up and see that if we don\u2019t act, this is going to be an increasing problem,\u201d Mark Levine, a member of the New York City Council, told The New York Times.\nBut some developers are defending the practice of limiting amenities to certain tenants."}
