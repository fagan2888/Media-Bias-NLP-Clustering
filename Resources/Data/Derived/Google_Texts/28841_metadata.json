His firm has helped clients navigate captive-insurance waters, as more businesses question a system wherein 50 cents of every dollar paid in premiums goes to the insurer\u2019s overhead.\n\n\u201cBusinesses are saying, \u2018Why should I let the insurance company capture that profit?\u2019\u201d Massimo said.\n\nKelly Madison, a health benefits broker and wellness consultant in Boise, said there hasn\u2019t been much interest in captive insurance in Idaho in the past because employers didn\u2019t know it was an option. Lately, more companies have been taking notice of the option, she said, because of rising insurance prices.\n\nMadison said some of her clients are creating partly self-funded health insurance plans. The plans can save companies money if they have a young or healthy workforce, but there are risks to self-funding, she said. Companies need a good administrator and sound actuarial basis for their health plan.\n\n\u201cThere are other options out there that employers are looking at,\u201d Madison said. \u201cSome think they\u2019re locked into using a regular, fully insured plan.\u201d\n\nCompanies that use captive insurance are also drawn to the option of tailoring coverage to their own circumstances. For example, companies with captive insurance plans can cover certain claims that wouldn\u2019t be covered through general liability coverage. Or they can provide options such aseliminating high deductibles and long waiting periods for benefit payments. They can also add language providing for businesses interruptions caused by hurricanes or some other natural disaster, something a typical corporate policy might not cover.\n\n\u201cYou can set up a captive so after the first day, it begins paying benefits,\u201d said Walter Montag, a financial planner in Uniondale, N.Y. \u201cA captive insurance company can be customized to the needs of the individual company when commercial coverage might not be able to do that.\u201d\n\nThe concept of the self-insuring company goes back at least to the 1500s. In the 16th century, ship owners joined forces and shared the risks of their expensive trade. By the 1800s, New England textile manufacturers were pooling resources to protect against fire damage.\n\nIn the 1950s, broker Frederic Reiss, considered the father of the captive-insurance industry, helped create an offshore insurance company specifically to service Ohio\u2019s Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co., and in the 1970s Harvard University created a captive insurance program to cover medical malpractice claims.\n\nSince then, major-league firms such as General Electric and General Motors have created their own captives, or formed professional groups that collectively insure their members only. Financial institutions, health care service providers, retailers, consumer-products companies, construction firms and utilities most frequently go this route, according to a Market Research Reports study.\n\nBut it\u2019s not nearly as simple as snapping your corporate fingers, pumping a few bucks into a fund and starting an insurance company. The risk for smaller companies that \u201caren\u2019t as well-capitalized\u201d is real, according to Montag. Among other things, they might not have enough capital to cover huge claims.\n\nRobert Morris, president of Lake Success, N.Y. brokerage The Rampart Group, said variables such as size and loss history truly determine whether a captive makes sense.\n\nOther insiders point directly to a company\u2019s profit margin: Depending on a company\u2019s size, the type of insurance in question and the number of insured individuals, establishing and administering captive insurance operations can easily cost six figures or more annually, Massimo said.\n\n\u201cA lot of work goes into administering a captive,\u201d Massimo said. \u201cWhen you pay insurance premiums, there\u2019s so much you don\u2019t see.\u201d\n\nStill, \u201cadministering your captive is less expensive than paying hundreds of thousands in premiums you never see a return on,\u201d he added.\n\nThere are also tax benefits. Firms can transfer up to $1.2 million pre-tax to cover costs associated with captive insurance programs, and unused funds can later be withdrawn as qualified dividends at a 15 percent tax rate or as long-term capital gains at a 20 percent tax rate \u2013 far lower than many personal and corporate tax rates.\n\nCompanies should be wary of creating faux captive-insurance programs as a tax shelter, but that\u2019s precisely what some are doing, Montag said.\n\nSome smaller companies are now creating illusory insurers specifically to avoid taxes, he said, \u201crelying on the fact that the IRS won\u2019t bother them.\u201d\n\n\u201cUntil now, it\u2019s been a blue-blood thing by General Motors or Exxon,\u201d Montag noted. \u201cThey use it as a tax ploy.\u201d\n\nCaptive-insurance programs are often established in states and offshore regions with favorable tax laws, including Vermont, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg. And as Affordable Care Act mandates kick in, some insiders expect the trend to increase.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have no choice but to cover full-time employees at a significant cost,\u201d Massimo said. \u201cOpening your own captive lets you manage your risks better and potentially capture some profits.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Facing high insurance rates and expanding coverage gaps, businesses are forming internal insurance companies with just one client: themselves.", "generator": "WordPress", "author": "Claude Solnik", "og": {"site_name": "Idaho Business Review", "description": "Facing high insurance rates and expanding coverage gaps, businesses are forming internal insurance companies with just one client: themselves.
