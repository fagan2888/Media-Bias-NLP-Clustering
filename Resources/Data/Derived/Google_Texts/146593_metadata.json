Mitt Romney, a critic of the Affordable Care Act, and sitting Bay State Gov. Deval Patrick, one of President Barack Obama's staunchest supporters, will both appear on \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday with David Gregory to offer their takes on the president's national health care reform law and the troubled rollout of the federal enrollment exchange website.\n\nPatrick introduced Obama this week when the president visited Boston to defend the embattled health law. Obama stopped at Faneuil Hall on the same stage that Romney in 2006 signed the Massachusetts-based health reform law, which became the model for Obamacare.\n\nRomney, before the president's visit, said the Massachusetts reform plan \"should not be grafted onto the entire country.\"\n\nPatrick has expressed confidence that Healthcare.gov will be fixed, repeatedly emphasizing that the ACA \"is not a website. It's a values statement.\"\n\nThe two governors will not appear in studio together, but Patrick is expected to get the last word. The show starts at 10:30 a.m. on NBC affiliates.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@homepage','@mobile','affordable-care-act','deval-patrick','meet-the-press','mitt-romney','politics','television','tv'", "title": "Deval Patrick, Mitt Romney to offer opinions about Affordable Care Act on 'Meet The Press'", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Deval Patrick, Mitt Romney to offer opinions about Affordable Care Act on \\u0027Meet The Press\\u0027\", \"link\": \"http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/11/deval_patrick_mitt_romney_to_o.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/politics_impact/photo/010307-mitt-romney-deval-patrickjpg-a2e5568360d3f2e0.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11557142\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-11-02T00:04:04Z\", \"author\": \"State House News Service\", \"tags\": [\"@homepage\",\"@mobile\",\"affordable-care-act\",\"deval-patrick\",\"meet-the-press\",\"mitt-romney\",\"politics\",\"television\",\"tv\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.masslive.com/politics_impact/photo/13695734-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "Patrick introduced Obama this week when the president visited Boston to defend the embattled health law.
