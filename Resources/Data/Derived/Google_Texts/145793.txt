Obama has blackmailing states that don’t want male transvestites in their daughter’s bathroom (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)

Here’s a simple solution to the transgender potty talk: Gut all multiuser bathrooms and build single, user-only occupancy bathrooms. Problem solved, end of story.

More disturbing is the arrogant dictator of the United States who never saw an executive order he didn’t like, shoving his edicts down our throat. Getting Obamacare passed without one Republican vote while claiming to be the “unifier,” making nuns go before the Supreme Court to protest being forced to give birth control under Obamacare, which is a violation of church and state precepts set forth in our Constitution, and now playing blackmail with states that don’t want male transvestites in our daughter’s bathroom with a director telling every public school district in the country to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms that match their gender identity.

I haven’t seen a presidency like this, one which claims to be populist, since Saddam Hussein.
