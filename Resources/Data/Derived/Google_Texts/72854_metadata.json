They left out a kitchen sink only because it caused the bun to get too soggy.\n\nAll this \u2014 and it\u2019s not even State Fair season yet!\n\nBut \u2014 as they say in the infomercials \u2014\n\nwait, there\u2019s more!\n\nThe Brewers\u2019 concessions team has also come up with \u201cInside the Park Nachos,\u201d which are basically nachos-on-a-stick. Take some taco meat, cover it with a crushed Doritos \u201cbreading,\u201d add cheese sauce and sour cream and you\u2019re good to go.\n\nBesides fulfilling the Wisconsin state law requiring sports teams and festivals to serve crazy foods, these new menu items serve a practical purpose, too. By the time you awaken from your cheese coma, the Packers will be playing and you\u2019ll forget that the Brewers\u2019 pitching was weak.\n\nThe end is near!\n\nNow, the better news: You may as well indulge in these calorie bombs because the whole world is about to be destroyed.\n\nThat\u2019s according to physicists who are reporting that our universe will soon stop expanding and collapse in on itself, obliterating all matter as we know it. Lucky for us, in science-speak, \u201cimminent\u201d means tens of billions of years, give or take.\n\nSo I guess we can go back to worrying about ISIS, student loans, Hillary\u2019s emails, interest rates, Vladimir Putin and the Iran nuke talks.\n\nAntonio Padilla at the University of Nottingham told Phys.org, \u201cWe are seeing dark energy now that could be taken as an indication of impending doom, and we are trying to look at the data to put some figures on the end date.\u201d\n\nCheers!\n\nOh, and Ted Cruz? The junior senator from Texas turned GOP presidential candidate recently announced he is going on Obamacare now that his wife is taking an unpaid leave of absence from Goldman Sachs and is giving up her health insurance.\n\nApparently, Cruz \u2014 who has made repealing the Affordable Care Act the centerpiece of his political life \u2014 does not know the meaning of the word irony. Or maybe he\u2019s counting on the universe imploding.\n\nHave a comment?

(Don\u2019t ask me how I\u2019m doing with my actual bracket, however \u2026)In a funny twist, the Badgers defeated the Wildcats of Arizona to reach the Final Four \u2014 for the second consecutive year \u2014 and now face another pack of Wildcats, from the University of Kentucky.With apologies to all the crazy cat ladies I know, here\u2019s hoping the Badgers know more than one way to skin a Wildcat.\n\nGet out the vote\n\nThe terror group Boko Haram killed dozens of people \u2014 and scared off hundreds more from polling places \u2014 but, still, millions of people voted in Nigeria\u2019s presidential election last weekend.Risking your life for the right to vote? Can you believe it?That\u2019s a reminder to all of us to get off our duffs and vote on Tuesday.This election is expected to be the usual low-turnout non-presidential event. But wouldn\u2019t it be great if it wasn\u2019t? Locally, there\u2019s a referendum on funding athletic facilities for the Kenosha Unified School District, plus school board and town board races. There\u2019s also a statewide amendment that would change how the chief justice of the state\u2019s Supreme Court is selected.Fortunately, we don\u2019t have to risk our lives to vote, but that doesn\u2019t mean we should take this right for granted. Go to the polls on Tuesday. And, if you want to vote ahead of time, the city clerk\u2019s office will be open for early voting today and Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.Vote as if your life depended on it. Who knows? Someday it might.", "article_metadata": {"robots": "index,follow", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 424648924332198}, "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Locally, there\u2019s a referendum on funding athletic facilities for the Kenosha Unified School District, plus school board and town board races.\nHow \u2019bout them Badgers, right?It\u2019s Wisconsin Badgers in, Indiana Hoosiers out \u2014 for those of you keeping track of where basketball stands in my split Wisconsin/Indiana household.\nThe blueprint: This \u201cUltimate Wisconsin Brat\u201d is covered with french fries, gravy, cheese curds, sauerkraut, cheese sauce, fried jalapenos, sour cream and chives.\nThe Brewers\u2019 concessions team has also come up with \u201cInside the Park Nachos,\u201d which are basically nachos-on-a-stick.\nThey left out a kitchen sink only because it caused the bun to get too soggy."}
