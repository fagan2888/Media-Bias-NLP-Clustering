Tech experts are asking questions about Lois Lerner\u2019s hard drive, but the powerful tax agency isn\u2019t answering them. \u201cThere is a certification of destruction any time a piece of equipment is sent to a disposal company,\u201d the head of an IT trade group said, according to Politico. \u201cWhere is that?\u201d Questions like this are coming on the heels of the testimony of an IRS official who said that he wasn\u2019t sure that the backup tapes on which Lois Lerner\u2019s emails were destroyed. IRS Commissioner John Koskinen will appear before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee this morning at 10am. We\u2019re expecting fireworks. So, yeah, popcorn.\n\n\u2014 \u2018Tis but a scratch: While we\u2019re on the topic, the House Ways and Means Committee has learned that Lois Lerner\u2019s hard drive was merely scratched and the data on it was recoverable, information that contradicts the testimony of IRS officials. \u201cIt is unbelievable that we cannot get a simple, straight answer from the IRS about this hard drive,\u201d Chairman Dave Camp said in a press release. \u201cThe Committee was told no data was recoverable and the physical drive was recycled and potentially shredded. To now learn that the hard drive was only scratched, yet the IRS refused to utilize outside experts to recover the data, raises more questions about potential criminal wrongdoing at the IRS.\u201d Camp explained that his committee\u2019s investigation could come to a close \u201c[i]f the IRS would just come clean and tell Congress and the American people what really happened.\u201d\n\n\u2014 There\u2019s another Obamacare case working its way through the courts: A Florida orthodontist sued the Obama administration last fall over the delay of the employer mandate. \u201cDr. Larry Kawa, who owns and operates Kawa Orthodontics in West Palm Beach, said his office lost $1.2 million in earnings after setting aside 100 hours to plan compliance with the 2014 employer mandate, which was to require big companies to either provide health insurance to employees or pay a fine,\u201d the Washington Examiner explains. \u201cKawa, represented by the D.C.-based Judicial Watch, filed suit in October 2013, seeking to have the 2014 employer mandate reinstated. The case was tossed out three months later by a U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach, but last week it was allowed to move forward by the Eleventh Circuit Court in Atlanta.\u201d Critics have argued that the Obama administration should have sought a legislative delay of the employer mandate rather than acting unilaterally to change the effective date of the provision, which was set to take effect at the beginning of the year. The mandate was delayed again earlier this year. The Eleventh Circuit will hear Kawa\u2019s case in October.\n\n\u2014 Join GenOpp\u2019s \u201cCreepy Carenival\u201d on the National Mall: Creepy Uncle Sam is back, and he\u2019ll appear at Generation Opportunity\u2019s Creepy Carenival on the National Mall this evening from 6pm to 9pm. \u201cCome one, come all! Come see the freakiest show on Earth!\u201d says the email United Liberty received reminding us of the event. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that Obamacare hasn\u2019t lived up to the hype: All across the country premiums have spiked, millions have lost their insurance and their doctors, and, what\u2019s worse, we\u2019re continually being sold a bundle of lies about how great Obamacare has been for our generation!\u201d Attractions include tightrope walkers, jugglers, carnival games, and food and drinks. Make sure you drop by if you\u2019re in the D.C. area. You can RSVP here.\n\n\u2014 Most. Transparent. President. EVAR!: If you keep repeating the lie, it eventually becomes true, right? CBS News\u2019 correspondent Major Garrett lodged a complaint at yesterday\u2019s press briefing on behalf of the White House Correspondents Association over the lack of transparency at an event to commemorate the 45th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. \u201cThe astronauts were among the most visible, televised national heroes this country has ever known, that entire program was financed by the American taxpayer,\u201d Garrett told White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest. \u201cStills presentation of that limits television coverage of that event we believe that is a classic definition of something that should have the broadest press coverage imaginable, and we are, therefore, lodging a complaint against your decision to keep us out.\u201d Earnest claimed the lack of press access was due to scheduling, but reporters \u2014 especially ABC News\u2019 Jon Karl \u2014 weren\u2019t buying it.\n\n\u2014 Good news on the school choice front: The University of Arkansas\u2019 Department of Education Reform has released a study (PDF) showing that children who consistently attend charter schools outperform those who go to traditional public schools. \u201cResearchers examined data from 21 different states. While the results varied, charter schools were found to be more productive\u2014and generate a higher return on investment\u2014than traditional public schools (TPS),\u201d Robby Soave explains at Reason. \u201cOn average, charter school students scored so much better on assessments that spending money on charters was roughly 40 percent more efficient than spending money on TPS.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Pennsylvania mother facing jail in New Jersey for carrying a firearm: Shaneen Allen, a Pennsylvania resident and single mother of two, is facing a three-year mandatory jail sentence if convicted of possession of a firearm in New Jersey. \u201cShaneen Allen, 27, was pulled over in New Jersey\u2019s Atlantic County after making an unsafe lane change in the early morning hours of Oct. 1. Allen then told the officer that she had the .380 Bersa Thunder handgun, as well as a concealed carry permit for Pennsylvania, unaware that her permit was not transferable to The Garden State,\u201d Fox News explains. \u201cAllen, who could not be reached for comment early Wednesday, had only owned the gun for a week prior to the arrest, [her lawyer] said, and purchased it for her protection after being robbed twice in the past year.\u201d New Jersey, a state in which concealed carry permits are rarely issued, does not recognize gun permits from any other state. Hopefully prosecutors will come to their senses here, but this situation just speaks to the absolute insanity of New Jersey\u2019s gun laws, which, sadly, could tear a mother who made an honest mistake away from her kids. For further reading, check out Radley Balko\u2019s excellent piece on Allen\u2019s situation and how gun control laws tend to be racially discriminatory.\n\n\u2014 Michele Bachmann may run for president again: The Minnesota Republican isn\u2019t running for reelection this fall, but that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s never going to seek office again. She told Real Clear Politics, when asked about Republican women who may run for president in 2016, that she\u2019s kicking around the idea. \u201cThe only thing that the media has speculated on is that it\u2019s going to be various men that are running,\u201d said Bachmann. \u201cThey haven\u2019t speculated, for instance, that I\u2019m going to run. What if I decide to run? And there\u2019s a chance I could run.\u201d Bachmann ran in 2012 and was the \u201cflavor of the month\u201d in August 2011 as conservatives looked for an alternative to Mitt Romney. She won the Ames Straw Poll, but finished next to last in the January 2012 Iowa caucuses.\n\n\u2014 Campaign for Liberty speaks out against Reid\u2019s Internet tax plans: Campaign for Liberty is rallying its activist network to oppose a push inside the Senate to attach the Internet sales tax to the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act. \u201cThere is nothing fair about tax-and-spend governors looking to the federal government to extend their taxing authority beyond their state\u2019s borders and upend \u2018no taxation without representation\u2019 because legislators refuse to budget and prioritize. And there is nothing fair about forcing our nation\u2019s small businesses to collect sales taxes for the nearly 10,000 different tax jurisdictions nationally,\u201d Campaign for Liberty President John Tate said in a statement. \u201cNot only is the Marketplace Fairness Act harmful to small businesses and consumers, but Harry Reid\u2019s attempt to attach it to legislation permanently prohibiting access taxes on the Internet is nothing short of bizarre. Only in Washington would politicians try to increase power to tax Internet purchases by attaching it to legislation preventing taxes on Internet access.\u201d\n\n\u2014 And in case you haven\u2019t noticed: The cronies at the so-called \u201cAlliance for Main Street Fairness\u201d are ramping up their shameless efforts to pressure Congress to pass the Internet sales tax. The Hill ran an op-ed from an Ohio small business owner tied to the organization who claimed his business is hurt because consumers who buy online don\u2019t have to pay sales taxes. The Alliance for Main Street Fairness also basically took over the frontpage of Politico.com with its Orwellian \u201de-fairness\u201d message.
