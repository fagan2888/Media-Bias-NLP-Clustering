Rosenthal\n\nGuest Contributor\n\nThe pediatric resident was frustrated.\n\nOn the exam table was a 6-month-old baby \u2014 quite overweight. In fact, the child was heavier than an average 1-year-old. But his mother just laughed when the resident asked how she was feeding the baby.\n\nWhen the resident and I looked at the medical record, we saw that for months residents had been discussing feeding with the mother. Telling her that she should stop formula feeding because her breast milk was more than sufficient. Telling her not to give solid foods because her breast milk was enough. And telling her that if she was going to give the baby formula or solid food, she should try to pay attention to when the baby\u2019s cry means hunger and when it means a wet diaper or a need for attention.\n\nOver one-third of adults and about 17 percent of children in the United States are obese. And since people who are obese have more high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease than their peers, it\u2019s not surprising that there are 11 million office visits per year for adults with obesity.\n\nYet according to a new CDC report, only 40 percent of these 11 million visits for obesity include a discussion of diet and exercise.\n\nMany health care providers don\u2019t want to talk to their patients about diet and exercise because they think the patients may feel judged. And sometimes doctors don\u2019t talk about fitness and nutrition because they actually think talking won\u2019t change anything. Which makes it safe to assume that office visits for obesity rarely include a discussion about the life experiences of the patients and the parents of patients. This suggests that a critical issue \u2014 and a key part of any treatment plan \u2014 is never addressed.\n\nParents\u2019 medical history has always been an important aspect of a child\u2019s medical care. But the central importance of all this has only recently emerged: New research has shown how life experiences affect brain development and hormone responses and how that affects parenting behavior and the health of the child in the next generation.\n\nIt\u2019s hard enough to do this with families who speak English and come to the doctor\u2019s appointment ready to talk about themselves. With this overweight 6-month-old, it was even harder: The resident was using a Swahili phone interpreter and the mother was a refugee.\n\nInterpreters are a vital but tricky part of office visits for families who don\u2019t speak English. Professional interpreters (as opposed to family members interpreting) improve understanding and outcomes for the more than 20 million Americans who don\u2019t speak English well but they aren\u2019t always available. With this mother, speaking a language that is uncommon in New Haven, we used a professional phone interpreter \u2014 certainly better than no interpreter but over the phone cultural nuance and body language can be lost.\n\nKnowing the mother was a refugee fleeing a Swahili-speaking country should have completely reframed our view of the patient\u2019s weight. For U.S. children, our filter includes the statistics about childhood obesity and sugar consumption; but in this case, we should have employed a more global filter.\n\nAt the Yale/New Haven Primary Care Center we screen for familial social factors. For example, we screen all new mothers for depression, housing stability and safety. But it\u2019s unclear how well the screening works when translated into the language and culture of this mother.\n\nIn our center, we have a designated refugee clinic where we ask about the whole family\u2019s experience as refugees. But this child is not enrolled in that clinic because as pediatricians, we enroll children in the refugee clinic only when the child is a refugee. This 6-month-old baby was born here, in our hospital.\n\nAs an American child, he will benefit from the safe water supply, vaccinations and other preventive and public health aspects of the United States. While the health risks to childhood refugees include tuberculosis, under-nutrition, obesity and other chronic conditions, the risks to American-born children of refugees is less understood. Yet re-framing this patient\u2019s story as an American child of a refugee woman, who may have experienced trauma and food insecurity, it makes sense that this child is being fed more than he needs.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t know exactly why this mother is feeding her baby this way, it doesn\u2019t take too much of a leap to imagine that the mother\u2019s prior experience with a limited food supply has led her to overfeed her child. Or that she is controlling what she can in her life \u2014 she can decide how much to feed the baby and she can probably stop his normal baby cries by feeding him. We don\u2019t actually know what this mother was thinking \u2014 she was speaking Swahili to the phone interpreter and not a lot of it. She didn\u2019t say any of this through the interpreter but to be honest, we didn\u2019t ask.\n\nCaring for the health of children means two-generation care. It means understanding the mental health, physical health and life experiences of the whole family.\n\nProfessional guidelines recommend that pediatric providers ask about parental experiences. Parents are usually OK with being asked about their own health, and the Affordable Care Act allows us to get reimbursed for asking and counseling about maternal mental health.\n\nYet, we don\u2019t always ask. There often remains a sense that the family won\u2019t want to talk about it or that we won\u2019t change our treatment plan anyway, or that the patient won\u2019t have access to the outside providers we refer them to. Honestly, we don\u2019t do as good a job as we could in considering how the whole family\u2019s life affects that of the child. For the sake of babies like this one, we need to do better.\n\nMarjorie S.
