Costs under the Affordable Care Act could still be too much for many consumers.

Americans with health insurance through the Affordable Care Act could still be subject to thousands of dollars in deductibles and additional out-of-pocket costs in the plan they choose, USA Today reports.

Health insurance available through the Affordable Care Act could help Americans pay for unexpected medical expenses, but the deductibles and limits on cost sharing could cause continued medical debt, according to the report.

Health insurance deductibles available through the federal exchange in 34 states range from an average of $3,000 to $5,082 for the least expensive plans, according to data from HealthCare.gov analyzed by USA Today. Out-of-pocket limits for individual plans start at $4,350 and $8,700 for families and could be more with the addition of higher premiums.

Cost sharing, which is the required amount consumers pay for medical care, is a maximum of $6,350 for individuals and $12,700 for families. A majority of Americans have less than $3,000 saved for these expenses, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation report cited by USA Today.

However, Department of Health and Human Services spokesman Joanne Peters told USA Today that the situation is better now than before the ACA was enacted.

“The new marketplace is night and day from what consumers faced in the individual market before the healthcare law, where they could see unlimited out-of-pocket expenses for plans with limited benefits and high deductibles, if they (could) even get coverage without being denied for a pre-existing condition,” Peters said.
