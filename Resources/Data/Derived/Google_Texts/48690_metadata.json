It seems we have something to learn from Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose concurring opinion today in Holt v Hobbs, a religious liberty case involving a Muslim inmate\u2019s beard, came in at 65 words, including references and parentheticals. The justices held unanimously that there is no compelling reason for Arkansas prisons to deny Gregory Holt\u2019s request to wear a half-inch beard, which he regards as his religious duty. Justice Samuel Alito wrote that under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalised Persons Act, Mr Holt (pictured) can grow his beard. The state\u2019s justifications for shearing Mr Holt\u2019s face against his will\u2014preventing prisoners from hiding contraband like SIM cards and blades in their whiskers and ensuring that prison guards can readily identify inmates\u2014are, in the court\u2019s view, spurious.\n\nJustice Ginsburg signed on to Justice Alito\u2019s opinion but wrote separately to emphasise that Mr Holt\u2019s demand is fundamentally different from the claim put forward in last year\u2019s controversial Burwell v Hobby Lobby case. In Hobby Lobby, owners of a crafts store sought, and received, by a 5-4 vote, an exemption from the contraceptive mandate of the Affordable Care Act. As evangelical Christians, David Green and his family members asserted that they could not, in good conscience, pay to supply their employees with birth control devices and drugs they considered to be abortifacients.\n\nFor Hobby Lobby, Justice Ginsburg filed a fiery, full-throated dissent. Her central contention was that the majority refused to consider \u201cthe impact that accommodation may have on third parties who do not share the corporation owners\u2019 religious faith\u201d. So in Holt v Hobbs, she felt the need to clarify her vote:\n\nThe distinction Justice Ginsburg wishes to push, then, is this: part of the court\u2019s investigation in considering whether to grant religious exemptions from generally applicable laws, as in Hobby Lobby, or from prison grooming regulations, as in Holt, is whether and in what way the accommodation will impact the lives of third parties. No one suffers when Mr Holt lets his stubble grow a bit. But when a corporation with 23,000 employees refuses to provide a benefit available under federal law, thousands of women are directly impacted. They have to buy their own birth control pills, for example, or shell out $1,000 for their own IUDs.\n\nIn a case from 1985, Estate of Thornton v Caldor, Inc., the Supreme Court struck down a law granting every employee the right not to come in to work on his or her Sabbath. This law, the justices found, constituted a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on employers, who had to offer higher pay to persuade workers to come in on the weekend. And it represented a \u201csignificant burden\u201d on non-religious employees who had to fill in for their Sabbath-observant colleagues:\n\n\u201cThe unyielding weighting in favor of Sabbath observers over all other interests contravenes a fundamental principle of the Religion Clauses: the First Amendment gives no one the right to insist that in pursuit of their own interests others must conform their conduct to his own religious necessities.\u201d\n\nFor Ian Millhiser of Think Progress, Justice Ginsburg\u2019s concurrence, in line with the reasoning in Caldor, is \u201ceverything you need to know about religious liberty.\u201d That\u2019s overstating things a bit. While there are clear cases like Hobby Lobby and Holt where an accommodation either does or doesn\u2019t entail harm on third parties, there are other cases that are more difficult to classify. You could say, for example, that no one is harmed when a Seventh Day Adventist gets her unemployment check after being fired for refusing to work on Saturday. But taxpayers foot that bill; they are an impacted third party. And you could say that when an Amish family gets to keep its children on the farm rather than sending them to high school, nobody outside the Amish world is negatively affected. But what about the children who are denied an education that could give them choices and expose them to possibilities outside the Old Order Amish Church? And what about the wider society, which may benefit if some talented Amish people decided to study physics or run for office?\n\nThese aren\u2019t easy questions, and I'm not suggesting the accommodations in these cases should have been denied. Those seeking clarity for future claims of religious free exercise will not find it in Justice Ginsburg\u2019s haiku-like concurrence in this case. But for all of its brevity, her opinion today reinforces how radical the court's ruling in Hobby Lobby was last June.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/50_by_50/images/2015/01/blogs/democracy-america/20150124_usp505.jpg", "sailthru.flytitle": "Religious liberty", "description": "Justice Ginsburg uses a case about beards in prison to reassert her frustration with the Hobby Lobby ruling", "pubdate": 20150121, "og": {"site_name": "The Economist", "description": "Justice Ginsburg uses a case about beards in prison to reassert her frustration with the Hobby Lobby ruling", "title": "Of beards and brevity", "url": "http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2015/01/religious-liberty", "image": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2015/01/blogs/democracy-america/20150124_usp505.jpg", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.rubric": "Justice Ginsburg uses a case about beards in prison to reassert her frustration with the Hobby Lobby ruling", "sailthru.date": "2015-01-21 01:33:41", "twitter": {"image": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2015/01/blogs/democracy-america/20150124_usp505.jpg", "site": "@TheEconomist", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@EconUS"}, "revisit-after": "1 day", "sailthru.web_section": "Blogs", "fb": {"pages": 6013004059, "app_id": 173277756049645}, "sailthru.imagepath": "images/2015/01/blogs/democracy-america/20150124_usp505.jpg", "articleid": 21640134, "sailthru.image.thumb_mfte": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/ec_related_article_image/images/2015/01/blogs/democracy-america/20150124_usp505.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "Religious liberty", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theeconomist"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2015/01/blogs/democracy-america/20150124_usp505.jpg", "news_keywords": "Religious liberty"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd39f\"", "article_summary": "But for all of its brevity, her opinion today reinforces how radical the court's ruling in Hobby Lobby was last June.\nJustice Samuel Alito wrote that under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalised Persons Act, Mr Holt (pictured) can grow his beard.\nFor Hobby Lobby, Justice Ginsburg filed a fiery, full-throated dissent.\nIn Hobby Lobby, owners of a crafts store sought, and received, by a 5-4 vote, an exemption from the contraceptive mandate of the Affordable Care Act.\nNo one suffers when Mr Holt lets his stubble grow a bit."}
