These are budget-savvy, self-pay patients who have found the best way around the ACA is straight through it.\n\nCarved into the ACA\u2019s individual mandate is an exception for members of health care sharing ministries (HCSMs). Membership in an HCSM costs less than health insurance, accommodates members\u2019 conscientious objections to the ACA, and reduces health care price inflation by placing patients directly in charge of their health care costs.\n\nHCSMs operate similarly to insurers, with important distinctions. Instead of premiums, members pay monthly fees commonly referred to as \u201cshares\u201d\u2014a key word in HCSMs\u2019 faith-based paradigm. Sharing for religious reasons is the basis for HCSMs\u2019 exemption. Groups such as Medi-Share, Samaritan Ministries, and Liberty HealthShare maintain Christians have been cost-sharing to meet each other\u2019s needs since the days of the early church, almost two thousand years ago.\n\nMonthly shares range from approximately $200 per individual to $500 dollars per family. Most organizations collect and redistribute these shares to other members with medical needs, although Samaritan members send shares (and sometimes an encouraging note or prayer) directly to needy members via personal check.\n\nThe receiving members pay a portion of their own medical expenses, similar to a deductible. A family within the Samaritan\u2019s framework would pay the first $300 for each of their first three non-preventive medical \u201cneeds\u201d in a year. Every dollar above this limit is \u201cpublishable,\u201d meaning members receive \u201cgifts\u201d (essentially reimbursements) for the remainder of all medical costs\u2014up to $250,000 per need\u2014until the need is met. After a family\u2019s third publishable need in a year, all subsequent needs costing at least $300 are publishable.\n\nThis means a typical Samaritan family pays a quasi-premium of $405 per month ($4,860 per year), for a quasi-deductible as low as $900 per year plus smaller-dollar non-publishable expenses.\n\nContrast these costs to those of health insurance. In 2015, the average family coverage premium was $17,545 per year, with employees contributing $4,955, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s 2015 Employer Health Benefits Survey. Employees with high deductible health plans were then liable to pay a family coverage deductible of $4,345 on average, with 19 percent having an aggregate family deductible of at least $6,000, states the same report. The legal limit on out-of-pocket maximums for family coverage was $13,200.\n\nDespite the huge savings HCSMs offer members over health insurance, many members turn to HCSMs because of conscience instead of cost. \u201cMembers are joining primarily on principle, not price,\u201d Anthony Hopp, Samaritan\u2019s director of membership development, told Health Care News]]]on April 7. \u201cIt\u2019s a biblical health care option that is consistent with their religious beliefs.\u201d\n\nHCSMs attract some members who qualify for federal subsidies or Medicaid expansion under the ACA, but who morally object to receiving taxpayer-funded premium assistance when reasonably priced non-government alternatives are available.

Most members are self-pay patients who frequently pay cash at the time of service, expecting to receive quasi-reimbursements (gifts in the form of others\u2019 shares) in the following months.\n\nAs self-payers, members are predisposed to negotiate discounts with providers, who are glad to increase their profit margin by cutting out middle-man insurers. Such savings lower the bottom line for HCSMs, some of which financially reward members who earn large discounts. By contrast, insured individuals typically have no idea what their health care actually costs, and many try to max out their annual deductibles to gain the illusion of \u201cfree\u201d health care the rest of the year.\n\nCost-effective, principled, and patient-driven, HCSMs are the holy grail of health care insurance alternatives.
