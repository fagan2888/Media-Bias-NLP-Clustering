President Obama signed it into law. To their credit, not a single Republican voted for Obamacare. Since the day Obamacare became law, Republicans have campaigned non-stop against it. There were elections in 2010, 2012 and 2014. The centerpiece of the Republican message was get rid of Obamacare.\n\nNow, the perfect storm is coming together to destroy Obamacare once and for all.\n\nAnd what is the Republican Party doing?\n\nThe GOP in Washington is working on the Obamacare bailout.\n\nThe perfect storm is twofold. First, Americans who applied for Obamacare and received a subsidy are about to get a rude shock. For many of those people, the government miscalculated the subsidy. If the government overpaid the subsidy, there is a claw-back provision in Obamacare that allows the government to take the money back.\n\nMillions of people are going to get some really bad news when they file their taxes. They aren\u2019t getting a refund. They are going to owe thousands or even tens of thousands. Remember, these are people who could not afford health insurance to begin with.\n\nHow are they going to pay the claw-back payments?\n\nThis will force a lot of people into bankruptcy. And unfortunately, they will discover that they cannot discharge those obligations in bankruptcy.\n\nIn June, the U.S. Supreme Court will decide the case of King v. Burwell. Most court observers expect the Supreme Court will strike down the federal government\u2019s subsidy programs in the 34 states that have not implemented health care exchanges.\n\nThis will destroy Obamacare. The numbers simply do not work without the subsidies.\n\nInstead of readying on a legislative sword to chop the head off of the Obamacare monster, the GOP leadership is planning a replacement bill that is merely \u201cObamacare-lite.\u201d\n\nObamacare-lite is half the agony with twice the problems.\n\nInstead of simply junking the whole thing, the Republicans want to leave in most of the employer mandates. They do want to allow some good things, such as the portability of insurance across state lines.\n\nUnfortunately, the Republican Party seems more interested in helping big insurance instead of real Americans. One of the proposals in the Hatch-Burr plan, which is the GOP replacement for Obamacare, is to impose medical malpractice caps through out the United States.\n\nThis has been the Holy Grail for big insurance for a while.\n\nIf someone goes to the hospital for a knee replacement and the doctor amputates their leg instead, under Hatch-Burr their damages would be limited. And, instead of getting a trial by a jury of their peers, instead they would funnel them off to some quasi-administrative board. Imagine the worst of the IRS and the DMV all rolled up in one.\n\nWhy the Republicans are so anxious to kowtow to big insurance is a mystery. Big insurance generally gives to Democrats over Republicans.\n\nThe real problem here is Washington. Obamacare has been a disaster. Barack Obama may be the only one in Washington still in denial about that. But in Washington, they expect America to rely on the people who caused the problem to start with to then fix the problem.\n\nWhat is wrong with that picture?\n\nGive this problem another six weeks and even hard-core Democratic voters are going to be screaming for Obamacare to be repealed. Republicans could get in front of this wave and help launch a Republican majority that will last for a decade.\n\nBut if history is any indication, Republicans will take a Democratic problem and turn it into a much worse Republican problem.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The perfect storm is coming together to destroy Obamacare once and for all, and the GOP in Washington is working on the Obamacare bailout.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The perfect storm is coming together to destroy Obamacare once and for all, and the GOP in Washington is working on the Obamacare bailout.", "title": "JUDSON PHILLIPS: A perfect storm of Republican idiocy", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/10/judson-phillips-perfect-storm-republican-idiocy/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/04/health-overhaul-supreme-courtjpeg-0be08.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/04/health-overhaul-supreme-courtjpeg-0be08.jpg", "description": "The perfect storm is coming together to destroy Obamacare once and for all, and the GOP in Washington is working on the Obamacare bailout.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "JUDSON PHILLIPS: A perfect storm of Republican idiocy"}, "Author": "Judson Phillips", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Barack Obama, Republican Party, Washington"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1577\"", "article_summary": "But if history is any indication, Republicans will take a Democratic problem and turn it into a much worse Republican problem.\nUnfortunately, the Republican Party seems more interested in helping big insurance instead of real Americans.\nThis has been the Holy Grail for big insurance for a while.\nRepublicans could get in front of this wave and help launch a Republican majority that will last for a decade.\nNow, the perfect storm is coming together to destroy Obamacare once and for all."}
