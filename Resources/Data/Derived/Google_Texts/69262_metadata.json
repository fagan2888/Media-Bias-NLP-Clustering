Now U.S.-led forces can use Turkey\u2019s Incirlik Air Base, which is strategically located near the Turkish-Syrian border, to better bear down on ISIS forces and emplacements in that region.\n\nRelated: After Hanging Back, Cameron Vows to Escalate Air Strikes Against ISIS\n\nAir operations, including US-led air attacks against ISIS, account for most of the big spend, which has exceeded $3.21 billion since operations began last August. Defense Department records confirm that daily operations average $9.9 million a day, up from $9.4 million since \u201cOperation Inherent Resolve\u201d began.\n\nThe breakdown of expenses is as follows, according to DOD:\n\nAir operations: 53 percent\n\nMunitions and operational support: 23 percent each\n\nIf the war escalates or if the U.S. needs to pump up the power and resources, annual costs skyrocket into the tens of billions of dollars.\n\nRelated: The New U.S. Price Tag for the War Against ISIS: $40 Billion a Year\n\nISIS has proved to be a formidable and ruthless opponent, and the U.S. led effort has had mixed results at best in pushing them back.
