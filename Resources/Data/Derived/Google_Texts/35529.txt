Facebook is no longer including search results from Bing. The action will put an end to a four year long agreement of Microsoft and Facebook. However, the two firms will continue their partnership in other areas.

The biggest tech engine still holds small stakes in Facebook. A few months ago, Microsoft invested around $240 million which gave nearly 1.6 percent of stake in Facebook. The amount valued $15 billion for Facebook.

Facebook is all set to refurbish the search engine of the company. The social networking site will probably roll out the new feature on Monday. The tool will permit users to find old posts and comments of the people present in their friendsâ€™ list.

A spokesman of Facebook informs that the firm is concentrating on showing results from the old posts as well. On the other hand, Microsoft declined to make any comment on this issue.

The move demonstrates the interest of Facebook in web search technology. It seems like the social networking site is trying to become a rival of Google through these minor measures.

Earlier, Mark Zuckerberg called search as one of the biggest means to increase the revenue of the company. According to the statistics reports of July, around 1 billion people searched different things on Facebook daily. This large number of searches shows that soon Facebook will take place of other major search websites.

Microsoft and Facebook were collaborated for this search engine in October 2007. The agreement compels Microsoft to ban all the ads on Facebook websites in the International market.

The previous search engine of Facebook let users search anything present on the social networking site. After few years, the social networking service joined hands with Microsoft for standalone websites offered by Bing.
