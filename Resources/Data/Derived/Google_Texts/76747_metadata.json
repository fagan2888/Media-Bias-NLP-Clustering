In a nutshell, the more you travel with the same airline (or its partners), the higher the odds you will be able to redeem miles or points for free travel and achieve an elite status, which carries perks such as priority boarding, free checked bags, access to lounges and the possibility of free upgrades.\n\nThis locks passengers in and softens price competition among the airlines. Most carriers have such programs.\n\nRelated: What Air Travel May Look Like in 2039\n\nBased on our experience, only the largest European low-cost airlines, such as EasyJet and Ryanair, do not operate frequent flyer programs, relying on their passengers\u2019 loyalty to their ultra-cheap fares instead.\n\nHow the Programs Typically Work\n\nEach time you fly, you earn a certain number of miles or points, depending on the class of service, ticket price, your current status within the program and distance. Points can also be earned via partner airlines, hotels, credit card companies and others. Miles can be redeemed for rewards like free flights or upgrades and usually expire after several years.\n\nMiles or accompanying points are also used to earn a higher membership status with the airline, which can lead to better rewards and exclusive services. It\u2019s usually granted for one year at a time.\n\nFrequent flyer programs' evolution in recent years highlights one important trend: they are becoming less rewarding for most travelers. Underlying that trend are three major currents: miles are falling in value; the number of miles that can be earned on each trip is declining for many passengers; and airlines are diluting the benefits of their membership tiers by adding new ones on top for their most elite flyers.\n\nLosing Their Luster: Miles Inflation\n\nWe can analyze how \u201crewarding\u201d a frequent flyer program is in a number of ways. The most obvious metric is, of course, the number of miles required for a reward ticket. Back in 2010, one of us purchased a round-trip transatlantic award ticket with Delta for 50,000 miles. Now just a few years later the minimum number of miles required for such a ticket is 60,000, a 20% increase.\n\nRelated: How Cost-Saving Innovations Are Boon to Middle Class\n\nThe increase in the number of miles necessary to book a reward ticket along with the falling prices of tickets themselves have in effect devalued the mile. In 1995, a typical ticket cost $454 in today\u2019s prices, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Assuming 25,000 miles per reward ticket, 1,000 miles was worth about $18. This year airfares have averaged $389, implying that 1,000 miles are worth $15.60. But that\u2019s assuming the 25,000-mile ticket.\n\nIf you have to fork over an extra 5,000 miles for it, as is becoming the norm, then 1,000 miles is worth just $12.30, about a third less than in 1995.\n\nAnother way to assess these programs' value is the availability of award tickets. In the past, most airlines did not allow their frequent flyers to redeem award tickets during peak times such as Thanksgiving and Christmas \u2013 known as blackout dates \u2013 preferring to keep those seats available for fare-paying passengers.\n\nBut that\u2019s changing. Southwest, for one, has long differentiated its program among rivals by the absence of such dates. Instead it advertised that the only restriction for redeeming an award flight was availability of an empty seat.\n\nRelated: 7 Travel Secrets from Frequent Flyers\n\nThe major US airlines have since hopped on board and adopted similar policies. But booking award tickets during peak times comes with a higher price tag: a lot more miles. In other words, previously you might not have been able to redeem miles on a Thanksgiving week flight.\n\nNow you will be able to nab that reward seat, but it will set you back 30,000 miles for a one-way ticket instead of 12,500.\n\nWe can point to a perfectly reasonable explanation behind this reduction in the value of a mile. By allowing their passengers to earn miles with an increasing number of partners (most notably the credit card companies), the airlines have in effect printed a lot of miles, which has created increased demand for reward flights.\n\nOne can think about this in the same way we think about the central bank printing money. If the bank prints too many dollars, it will trigger inflation and reduce the purchasing power of the currency. Miles is the currency of airlines. By printing more miles and not increasing the capacity, the airlines must debase the value of miles to keep the system sustainable. This also creates incentives for consumers to use their miles faster.\n\nRelated: There Are Now 69,560 Americans Worth $30 Million or More\n\nWhile we do not have historical data to assess the speed of \u201cmiles inflation,\u201d it does appear that it is accelerating due to increased printing of miles and reduced restrictions on the use of miles for award tickets. Apart from raising the price of award tickets, the airlines try to devalue miles in other ways\n\nMore Flying, Fewer Miles\n\nA more-recent trend shows airlines increasingly tying the number of miles earned to the price of the ticket rather than the flight\u2019s distance, which will in most cases result in reducing how many are typically gained per trip. For instance, with distance-based system, a roundtrip between Los Angeles and Chicago would earn a passenger about 3,500 miles. Now, with the new programs being adopted by Delta and United, to get this many miles would require a traveler in the lowest tier of their programs to spend $700 on this ticket \u2013 80% above the average airfare in the US.\n\nSouthwest Airlines was the first to alter how it rewards miles in 2011. Beginning next year other carriers will follow suit, first with Delta Air Lines in January and United Airlines in March. American Airlines, for its part, does not directly link the number of miles awarded to the ticket price. It does, however, awards just 50% of miles flown on discounted economy class tickets.\n\nA Growing Tower of Tiers\n\nAdding on more membership tiers for the most elite flyers is another way airlines are devaluing their programs for the majority of us. A few years ago, for example, Delta introduced a new \u201cdiamond\u201d upper tier within its Skymiles program, which devalued somewhat the benefits of its lower \u201cgold\u201d and \u201cplatinum\u201d levels.\n\nThis is in effect increasing inequality among frequent flyers. The most prolific travelers are being awarded significantly more with their own private lounges and other exclusive benefits, while other loyal customers who don\u2019t fly quite as often are seeing their perks such as ability to upgrade and lounge access diminish. This inequality will only increase as the airlines link the number of miles earned to the ticket price, and the most frequent flyers usually travel in business class and pay higher fares.\n\nWhat does all this mean for the passengers? If we were to draw one conclusion from the recent changes to the airlines\u2019 programs it would be that frequent travel will be more rewarding for business travelers and less so for regular customers who only fly once or twice a month. You will also earn less if you tend to book your travel in advance and snag a more discounted ticket, as carriers will increasingly link the number of miles earned to the ticket price.\n\nThe latter trend has a clear implication for travel managers: your road warriors flying on the company\u2019s dime will may have an incentive to delay booking their tickets to pay a higher price, thus earning more miles for themselves. This would be a manifestation of what economists call moral hazard, and if you are managing travel in your company, you should be on the lookout for it.\n\nThis article, written by Yuriy Gorodnichenko and Volodymyr Bilotkach, originally appeared in The Conversation.\n\nRead more at The Conversation:\n\nSo When Should You Book That Flight?\n\nPresident's Executive Order: What Difference Will It Make for Immigrants\n\nThe Timing of the Ferguson Case May Have Made Riots Worse", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Frequent flyer programs are one of the primary ways airlines build", "title": "How the One Percent Profit from Frequent Flyer Status", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/29/How-One-Percent-Profit-Frequent-Flyer-Status", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/12022013_Snowed_Airport.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/29/How-One-Percent-Profit-Frequent-Flyer-Status", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/12022013_Snowed_Airport.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Frequent flyer programs are one of the primary ways airlines build", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf7d8\"", "article_summary": "Frequent flyer programs' evolution in recent years highlights one important trend: they are becoming less rewarding for most travelers.\nLosing Their Luster: Miles InflationWe can analyze how \u201crewarding\u201d a frequent flyer program is in a number of ways.\nFrequent flyer programs are one of the primary ways airlines build customer loyalty.\nBack in 2010, one of us purchased a round-trip transatlantic award ticket with Delta for 50,000 miles.\nRelated: 7 Travel Secrets from Frequent FlyersThe major US airlines have since hopped on board and adopted similar policies."}
