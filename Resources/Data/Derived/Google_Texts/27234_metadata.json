And that\u2019s before today, when Lennar opens two new family-sized models that\u2019ll rank as some of the most affordable new designs in the south metro area \u2013 from just $369,900.\n\nLennar will have the Cupcake Truck out, noon until 2 p.m., as it unveils two homes that have never before been toured by homebuyers (Lennar kept visitors from seeing the plans until the decorating was done for this weekend\u2019s opening). One of the two is a big-value Pike design \u2013 four bedrooms plus a main-floor study, 3-\u00bd baths, with 2,336 square feet of finished space, from $411,000.\n\nMeanwhile, this location works so well that Lennar had a waiting list when it opened its luxurious Grand and Monarch series models here last spring. In a year when there are plenty of buyers looking around from out-of-state, Lennar has taken almost all sales from families who already live in established areas like Highlands Ranch and Centennial, waiting to move up and wanting to improve their commuting situation into DTC, Meridian, Lone Tree and other business campus areas.\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s virtually no inventory of homes out there now,\u201d says Patrick Hennessy, who\u2019ll greet you today along with Gina Korfiatis and Michael McCleery. \u201cThat\u2019s been a huge draw for us.\u201d\n\nSo are the amenities headed for Sierra Ridge that buyers see on the drawing board: Nice pool, clubhouse, oval-shaped park, and lots of trails on the way (some being completed now). Younger kids will go to Prairie Crossing Elementary (it\u2019s 8-for-10 stars at GreatSchools.org); and major grocery shopping is already within five minutes \u2013 adding to Park Meadows in Lone Tree to the west and a mix of restaurants and stores along Parker\u2019s own historic Mainstreet. Lot sizes, Hennessy adds, are a little larger than what you may be seeing in other areas \u2013 opportunities up to 11,000 square feet for Lennar\u2019s larger series; up to 7,000 feet for these new Pioneer Series homes opening today.\n\nAt a time when very few new homes are ready to deliver, you can see a couple today from Lennar\u2019s larger collections at Sierra Ridge. Those include a Fairfield 4-bedroom, 3-\u00bd bath model, with full basement and 3-car garage that Lennar has at $499,900. It shows off \u2018Everything\u2019s Included\u2019 features that Lennar provides standard in the price on this collection: hardwood floors throughout the main level, granite kitchen tops, stainless appliances, front-yard landscaping, air conditioning, 8-foot doors, LED lighting, wrought-iron stair rails, and clean, renewable solar energy at no additional cost \u2014 a state-of-the-art system provided and maintained by SunStreet Energy Group.\n\nTo reach the grand opening at Sierra Ridge, take Lincoln Avenue east from I-25, three miles to Urbana Street and turn south to Isle. Or if coming from Parker, take Lincoln west to Chambers Road and turn south to Cosmopolitan, and follow Lennar\u2019s signs carefully.\n\nGrand opening, affordable Pioneer Series at Sierra Ridge by Lennar, 1,720-2,336 sq. ft., first look at 2 family-sized models, choice for early move-in, walkouts available, solar system, pool & clubhouse planned, Cupcake Truck. 9989 Isle Cir., Parker; take Lincoln east from I-25 3 mi. to Urbana, turn south to Isle; or from Parker take Lincoln west to Chambers, south to Cosmopolitan, follow Lennar signs\n\nFrom $369,900\n\nToday 11 a.m. until 6 p.m., Cupcake Truck noon-2\n\n720-619-0198\n\nMark Samuelson writes on real estate and business; you can email him atmark@samuelsonassoc.com.
