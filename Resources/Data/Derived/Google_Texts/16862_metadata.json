Since then, Colorado has added 5,500 non-farm payroll jobs, raising the total to nearly 2.5 million jobs, the fifth-fastest job increase in the United States.\n\n\u201cEmployment gains and the improving labor market are pretty widespread across the state,\u201d said Alexandra Hall, chief economist for the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment.\n\nUntil recently, Colorado typically ranked between 23rd and 26th for unemployment rates, she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve moved up, improving our unemployment rate relative to other states as our economy improves and we absorb more people back into the labor market and add jobs at a healthy pace,\u201d Hall said, noting that job growth in the state is floating between a healthy 2.7 percent and 3 percent.\n\nFor the month, private-sector payroll jobs increased 6,000, and government jobs decreased 500. Hall said nothing suggests any kind of change in the job growth pattern the rest of the year.\n\nThe largest over-the-month private-sector job gains were in education and health services, up 2,900; construction, up 1,600; and professional and business services, up 1,500.\n\nLeisure and hospitality, which typically is robust in July, lost 2,100 jobs, the largest over-the-month decline for any sector.\n\n\u201cWe had really late snows and we\u2019ve had a really wet year,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is possible that the level of the mud in the high country and the moisture delayed some of the recreational activities that occur in the summertime.\u201d\n\nColorado was one of eight states to log an unemployment decline, according to Broomfield economist Gary Horvath. Twelve states and the District of Columbia were unchanged, while the others posted slight upticks.\n\n\u201cAt this point, many economists are pointing to stronger growth in the second half of the year for the U.S., which should point to a good year for Colorado, particularly retail and tourism in Colorado,\u201d said Horvath. He noted, however, that with the unemployment rate and the number of unemployed trending down, critical labor shortages are developing in Colorado in many occupations.\n\n\u201cThis is particularly critical to high-tech industries,\u201d Horvath said. \u201cIn addition, it is impacting all industries in northern Colorado, which is experiencing rapid growth as a result of the extractive (oil and gas) boom.\u201d\n\nThe unemployment rate was 4.3 percent in the tech-heavy regions of Boulder-Longmont and Fort Collins-Loveland, compared with 5.4 percent in Greeley and 5.2 percent in Denver-Aurora, the state reported.\n\nHorvath said workers are being poached from other companies and industries, which will ultimately drive wages up. He said the Colorado construction market still appears to be solid and the value of residential housing is growing, although at a slower rate than last year.\n\nThe Associated General Contractors of America said Monday that Colorado was one of 39 states where July construction employment increased year over year. Colorado and Texas are two of the states facing worker shortages.\n\nColorado had 135,600 people employed in construction in July, up from 127,900 in July 2013.\n\nIn its report Monday, the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment said that over the year, non-farm payroll jobs increased 65,600. Private-sector payroll jobs increased 58,300, and government jobs increased 7,300.\n\nThe largest private-sector job gains were in education and health services, professional and business services, and leisure and hospitality.\n\nHoward Pankratz: 303-954-1939, hpankratz@denverpost.com or twitter.com/howardpankratz", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado unemployment drops to 5.3 percent in July, adds 5,500 jobs", "title": "Colorado unemployment drops to 5.3 percent in July, adds 5,500 jobs", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/18/colorado-unemployment-drops-to-5-3-percent-in-july-adds-5500-jobs/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140818__20140819_A9_BZ18EMPLOY1p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140818__20140819_A9_BZ18EMPLOY1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-18T08:18:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T04:48:06+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8cb4\"", "article_summary": "Private-sector payroll jobs increased 58,300, and government jobs increased 7,300.\nIn June, the state unemployment rate was 5.5 percent.\nFor the month, private-sector payroll jobs increased 6,000, and government jobs decreased 500.\nColorado logged its 33rd consecutive month of job growth in July and unemployment dipped to 5.3 percent, the ninth-lowest rate in the country.\nHall said nothing suggests any kind of change in the job growth pattern the rest of the year."}
