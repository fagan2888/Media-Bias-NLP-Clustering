NEW YORK (MainStreet) — Drivers pay an average of 41% more for car insurance after making a single claim, according to the second annual study by insuranceQuotes.com.

Massachusetts continues to be the worst state to have an accident occur – just one claim leads to an average premium increase of 76% compared to 67% in 2014. The national average is up three percentage points this year, compared to the 38% increase found in 2014 (typically your premium will not increase if you are not to blame for the accident, except in a no-fault state). The cheapest state is Maryland, which only increases premiums by 22%.

California also penalizes drivers for just one claim and increases rates by 75%, followed by 62% in New Jersey. Other states which have lower increases include Michigan with a 23% increase and Montana with a 25% rise in premiums. To check out where your state ranks, go here.

Making a second claim proves to be very costly since a driver with two claims pays over twice as much for car insurance as a claim-free driver or 93%.

If you dent your car accidentally by backing into a pole in a parking garage and the amount of the damage is not much more than your deductible, it might be worth it to pay for the repair yourself

“Many consumers underestimate the consequences of making claims because they can affect your rate for years,” said Laura Adams, a senior analyst at insuranceQuotes.com. “If you get a premium hike for making a small claim that could hurt your finances over the long run.”
