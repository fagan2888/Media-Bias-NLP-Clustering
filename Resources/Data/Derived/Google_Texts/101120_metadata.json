It is as though Nancy Pelosi is still running the House and Harry Reid is still running the Senate. \u2018Betrayed\u2019 is not even the word here. What has happened here is worse than betrayal. Betrayal is pretty bad, but it\u2019s worse than that.\u201d\n\nHe called it \u201cout-and-out, in-our-face lying\u201d by GOP candidates on the campaign trail, and their betrayal and lies are what led to the candidacy of Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cIf Donald Trump didn\u2019t exist and if the Republican Party actually does want to win someday, they\u2019d have to invent him,\u201d Limbaugh said. \u201cIt\u2019s just mind-boggling when you figure out everything that has been granted Obama. All the money, the tax increases, the Cadillac plans in Obamacare. All kinds of punitive things in Obamacare, delayed yet again so that people will not be made aware of the pain and suffering Obamacare\u2019s gonna cause.\u201d\n\nRead the full transcript at Limbaugh\u2019s website.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "After the White House declared total victory when Congress approved the $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill, conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh told his listeners that it\u2019s time to \u201cdisband the Republican Party\u201d and start all over again. \u201cThe country was just sold down the river again by your very Republican Party,\u201d an infuriated Limbaugh \u2026", "title": "'Worse than betrayal': Rush Limbaugh says it's time to 'disband Republican Party' after bill", "locale": {"alternate": "en_US", "identifier": "en_US"}, "image": "http://www.bizpacreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rushlimbaugh0331feature.jpg", "url": "http://www.bizpacreview.com/2015/12/20/worse-than-betrayal-rush-limbaugh-says-its-time-to-disband-republican-party-after-bill-285938", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}}, "alexaVerifyID": "qC73ojZoktel85cbl12SAFJar9k", "fb": {"admins": "10152426200106417,10152720237657852,10200650572686956,3854753687919,100215693385946,549853448412696", "pages": 169204449790211, "app_id": 1502886339979348}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ConservativeNewsToday", "section": "News", "published_time": "2015-12-20T07:51:26+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf Donald Trump didn\u2019t exist and if the Republican Party actually does want to win someday, they\u2019d have to invent him,\u201d Limbaugh said.\nAfter the White House declared total victory when Congress approved the $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill, conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh told his listeners that it\u2019s time to \u201cdisband the Republican Party\u201d and start all over again.\n\u201cThe country was just sold down the river again by your very Republican Party,\u201d an infuriated Limbaugh began, before reading a headline from The Washington Times in which the White House declared total victory in the budget battle.\nWhat has happened here is worse than betrayal.\nLimbaugh noted that Republicans voted in record numbers to take over both chambers of Congress in order to push back at Obama\u2019s agenda."}
