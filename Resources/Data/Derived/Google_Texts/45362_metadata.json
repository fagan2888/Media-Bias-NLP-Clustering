Agustin Carstens Getty Images\n\nThe Mexican government sets gasoline prices, and in recent years has been raising them by a small amount each month to reduce the level of government subsidy. Starting next year, the price will be raised in line with expected inflation. And in coming years Mexico will move toward allowing markets to set the prices under recent changes in the country\u2019s energy laws that will open the business to the private sector. Currently, state oil company Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos is the only producer and importer of gasoline.\n\nIn July, the Bank of Mexico forecast that the annual inflation rate measured by the consumer price index would slow toward its 3% target in January of 2015, largely because the consumer tax increases that pushed prices up this year would fall off the 12-month radar screen.\n\nThe CPI was up 4.2% in the 12 months through September, above the central bank\u2019s 2%-4% comfort zone for a third consecutive month. Higher inflation and a pickup in economic growth are expected to keep the central bank from moving interest rates in the near term.\n\nIn September, the central bank said it expected the target to be approached in the first half of 2015. The new timing came as Finance Minister Luis Videgaray said next year\u2019s gasoline price increase of 3% will be a one-time event at the start of the year, replacing the current monthly hikes.\n\nDeutsche Bank said in a recent report that the front-loading of the gasoline price hike, and talk of raising Mexico\u2019s minimum wage, could push up inflation expectations early next year.\n\nBank of Mexico Gov. Agust\u00edn Carstens told reporters Tuesday the new gasoline price policy will help to meet the inflation target, since the planned increase is well below the accumulated increase of about 10% this year.\n\n\u201cReally, the cause of waiting a bit longer for inflation to converge toward the target is shocks in a number of prices, above all meat and some other agricultural prices that have been persistent,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re confident that the convergence will come about by mid-year.\u201d\n\nAnd that doesn\u2019t mean inflation won\u2019t slow in January as the effect of the new taxes wanes, he added.\n\nAlthough a major oil producer and exporter, Mexico imports more than 40% of its gasoline use of about 770,000 barrels a day.\n\nOn the subject of oil, and the recent drop in crude prices that could affect federal government revenue, Mr. Carstens appeared confident that Mexico has enough experience with oil-price swings and measures to counter it\u2014such as stabilization funds and an oil-price hedging program\u2014to mitigate the impact.\n\nMexican export crude was just over $80 a barrel on Monday, below the $82 price estimate in the 2015 budget proposal currently before Congress.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain":
