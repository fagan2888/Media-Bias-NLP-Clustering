Since 2008, Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood have had a blast co-hosting the CMA Awards. Their monologues, jokes and witty banter always keep the audience laughing, and in the years since the duo took over hosting duties, there have been some pretty unforgettable moments.

Some of the best moments include an explanation of “motorboating,” a song about “Obamacare,” a joke at Hank Williams Jr.‘s expense (but, don’t worry — he was in on it!) … and, of course, the big baby gender reveal in 2014.

Press play on the video above to re-live some of the most surprising, funniest and all-around best moments from Paisley and Underwood’s tenue as CMA Awards co-hosts.

The 2015 CMA Awards are scheduled to air live from Nashville on Nov. 4 at 8PM ET on ABC. For the eighth year, Paisley and Underwood have been named as the hosts.
