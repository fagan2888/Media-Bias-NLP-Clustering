While the voting ballots this fall will be chock full of the typical suit-clad politicians, there will also be plenty of less conventional candidates.\n\nWhen it comes to the campaign trail, not all candidates are exactly central casting. From a convicted felon turned reality TV star vying for a seat in the Senate, to a Florida congressional hopeful who dresses up as a vampire in his spare time\u2014there\u2019s no shortage of interesting candidates this election season.\n\nRelated: Munchkin Mayor Runs on Pro-Ice Cream Agenda\n\nThere\u2019s the main show of the 2014 election, of course. But there\u2019s also a sideshow and it\u2019s sometimes just as interesting.\n\nHere are the top seven quirkiest candidates\u2014ready for the limelight, but still waiting for voters to decide if they\u2019re ready for Washington.\n\nThe Florida Vampire: Jake Rush, the staunch conservative challenging Republican Rep. Ted Yoho in Florida\u2019s 3rd District, seems like your standard conservative candidate on the surface. His campaign platform is typical of most Tea Party politicians\u2014he wants to \u201cbalance the budget, reduce the debt and repeal Obamacare.\u201d However, what makes Rush stand apart from the others is the way he spends his free time\u2014dressing up as a vampire for live action role-play.\n\nThough he's tried to distance himself from his hobby on the campaign trail, his Internet-dubbed nickname as the \"Tea Party vampire\" is probably going to stick for a while.\n\nCesar Chavez For Congress: Scott Fistler, who made an unsuccessful run for Congress as a Republican in 2012, is now running for the same seat as a Democrat in Arizona's largely Hispanic 7th District. But Fistler didn\u2019t just change his party, he changed his name too\u2014to Cesar Chavez, the famous Latino American labor leader and civil rights activist. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as simple as saying Elvis Presley is running for president,\u201d he told the Arizona Republic. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t forget it, would you?\u201d However, the name change didn\u2019t work out for Fistler\u2014(or Chavez) since a judge recently kicked him off the ballot.\n\nThe Sweepstakes Guy: John King, a Republican candidate challenging Lamar Alexander in Tennessee, has a typical Tea Party platform. However, King\u2019s campaign stands out because instead of giving away buttons and pins, he\u2019s giving away prizes like a house, luxury vehicles, a Hawaiian vacation and a ton of guns if he pulls a tremendous upset and wins his August 7 primary.\n\nThe \u2018God Controls the Weather\u2019 Candidate: Susanne Atanus, the far Right Republican challenging Illinois Democratic Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) got some media attention when she told the Daily Herald that \u201cGod is angry,\u201d and \u201cwe are provoking him with abortions and same-sex marriage and civil unions.\u201d She also says she believes \u201csame-sex activity is going to increase AIDS,\u201d and \u201cif it\u2019s in our military it will weaken our military.\u201d She also doesn\u2019t believe the stock market crash of 1929 actually happened and that we don\u2019t need to worry about climate change because \u201cGod controls the weather.\u201d\n\nConvicted Felon/ Reality TV Star: Thomas Ravenel, who resigned from his post as South Carolina State Treasurer after getting convicted for cocaine distribution in 2007\u2014is running for Senate and banking on a certain constituency to get him elected. \u201cIf I can just get the drug vote, I can win by a landslide,\u201d said Ravenel the day after he filed a petition to throw his hat in the political arena and challenge Republican incumbent Lindsey Graham as an Independent. He currently stars in a reality show called \u201cSouthern Charm\u201d on Bravo.\n\nThe Talks to Statues Candidate: Al Salehi, a California Independent candidate running to replace retiring Republican Rep. John Campbell, caught some media attention for his somewhat bizarre campaign ad that opens with Salehi casually chatting with an anteater statue (the University of California at Irvine\u2019s mascot.) He also randomly declares in the video, \u201cThe state of California is the largest country in the world\u2026if it was a country.\u201d And it ends with him slowly walking off into the distance singing slightly off-key \"If you want your voice to count, vote for Al. If you want your vote to count, vote with Al. If you hate the status quo and you want to let them know, vote with AL, vote for Al, vote with Al,\" he sings. \"I'm Al Salehi and I approve this message!\n\nThe Guy Who Got A Little Too Aggressive In His Campaign Ad: Estakio Beltran, a Democratic candidate running to replace retiring Rep. Doc Hastings (R-WA) raised some eyebrows after airing an ad depicting him shooting an elephant pi\u00f1ata in the face and saying, \u201cThey call me a long shot. They say I can\u2019t win in this district. But what happens to an elephant when it stands around, doing nothing, for too long?\u201d The ad was apparently meant to \u201ccall attention to a do-nothing Congress in need of a kick in the butt,\u201d but in a heavily conservative district it didn\u2019t exactly go over well. Beltran eventually removed it, but it\u2019s probably not something voters will soon forget. Especially because it ends with Estakio riding a donkey bareback to DC with a shotgun in hand.\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Not everything is deadly serious about the congressional mid-term campaign and we highlight a few of the more unconventional candidates.", "title": "The Political Sideshow: 7 of the Country\u2019s Wackiest Candidates", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/04/Political-Sideshow-7-Country-s-Wackiest-Candidates", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Jake-Rush-vampire.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/04/Political-Sideshow-7-Country-s-Wackiest-Candidates", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Jake-Rush-vampire.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Not everything is deadly serious about the congressional mid-term campaign and we highlight a few of the more unconventional candidates.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdce40\"", "article_summary": "If you hate the status quo and you want to let them know, vote with AL, vote for Al, vote with Al,\" he sings.\nThe Sweepstakes Guy: John King, a Republican candidate challenging Lamar Alexander in Tennessee, has a typical Tea Party platform.\nThe Florida Vampire: Jake Rush, the staunch conservative challenging Republican Rep.
