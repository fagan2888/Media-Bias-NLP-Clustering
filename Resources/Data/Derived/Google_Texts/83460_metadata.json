That's why we are so concerned about everything they are doing to register people in firearms. Even when you go to register for Medicare or under these new programs they ask intrusive questions about -- that they have no business asking, they invade your privacy, and they also are asking questions about whether or not you have firearms in homes.\" Noting that the NRA has \"been concerned about gun registration since 1968,\" Porter also suggested that his claim about an Obama administration gun registry scheme meant that \"the public clearly sees and agrees with us about our concerns.\"\n\nNRA leadership often baselessly suggests that the Obama administration is attempting to secretly regulate firearms in a manner inconsistent with the administration's public positions. A White House spokesperson has said a national gun registry \"is not something that the president has supported\" and the post-Newtown massacre Obama administration proposal to reduce gun violence did not call for a registry. In fact, the NRA previously acknowledged in a since-deleted post on its website that the creation of a registry by the government would be currently contrary to two federal laws.\n\nFurthermore, in April, the NRA played a critical role in blocking Obama administration-backed U.S. Senate legislation that would have expanded background checks to all commercial gun sales while also making it a serious criminal offense for an attorney general to create a national gun registry.\n\nPorter offered no evidence to support his claim that Medicare enrollment includes questions about gun ownership and in fact no such question is included in the application for benefits. A related claim that Medicare Annual Wellness Visits include mandatory questions about gun ownership has also been thoroughly debunked.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Media Matters for America", "description": "National Rifle Association President Jim Porter falsely claimed that Medicare enrollees are asked to disclose household gun ownership to revive the NRA's decades-old scare tactics about a federal gun registry.\nOn the December 4 edition of the NRA News show Cam &amp; Company, Porter claimed, \"People are not interested in this government going into", "title": "NRA President Pushes Conspiracy Theory That Obama Will Use Medicare To Create Gun Registry", "url": "http://mediamatters.org/blog/2013/12/06/nra-president-pushes-conspiracy-theory-that-oba/197173", "image": "http://cloudfront.mediamatters.org/static/uploader/image/2013/09/18/nra.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-12-06T09:07:15-05:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://mediamatters.org/blog/2013/12/06/nra-president-pushes-conspiracy-theory-that-oba/197173", "title": "NRA President Pushes Conspiracy Theory That Obama Will Use Medicare To Create Gun Registry", "site": {"identifier": "@mmfa", "id": 13493302}, "card": "summary", "creator": {"identifier": "@mmfa", "id": 13493302}}, "fb": {"admins": 1092360128}, "article": {"section": "Blog", "tag": "National Rifle Association", "published_time": "2013-12-06T09:04:32-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-05T17:28:16-05:00", "author": "http://mediamatters.org/authors/timothy-johnson/178"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9f7e\"", "article_summary": "A White House spokesperson has said a national gun registry \"is not something that the president has supported\" and the post-Newtown massacre Obama administration proposal to reduce gun violence did not call for a registry.\nA related claim that Medicare Annual Wellness Visits include mandatory questions about gun ownership has also been thoroughly debunked.\nNational Rifle Association President Jim Porter falsely claimed that Medicare enrollees are asked to disclose household gun ownership to revive the NRA's decades-old scare tactics about a federal gun registry.\nPorter offered no evidence to support his claim that Medicare enrollment includes questions about gun ownership and in fact no such question is included in the application for benefits.\nNoting that the NRA has \"been concerned about gun registration since 1968,\" Porter also suggested that his claim about an Obama administration gun registry scheme meant that \"the public clearly sees and agrees with us about our concerns.\""}
