Mike Mozart, CC BY 2.0\n\nThe American Academy of Dermatology reports more than 3.5 million skin cancers are diagnosed each year, many of which could be avoided with the proper protection. This includes sunscreen \u2014 but according to the Environmental Working Group (EWG), not just any sunscreen.\n\nThe EWG recently released the ninth edition of its annual sunscreen guide, reporting 80 percent of 1,700 sunscreens on the American market \u201coffer inferior sun protection or contain worrisome ingredients.\u201d While the EWG goes on to call out several offending sunscreens (listed below), Neutrogena\u2019s products in particular stood out. Despite their claims to be the \u201c#1 dermatologist recommended sun care brand,\u201d all four of Neutrogena\u2019s sun care products rate in the red, or worst, zone of EWG\u2019s database.\n\n\u201cNeutrogena\u2019s \u2018Pure Free Baby\u2019 sunscreen claims \u2018special protection from the sun and irritating chemicals\u2019 and \u2018hypoallergenic,\u2019 but it contains a preservative called methylisothiazolinone, or MI, that some researchers call a potent allergen and that is deemed unsafe in Europe,\u201d the guide explained.\n\nAdditionally, some of Neutrogena\u2019s products are labeled SPF 70, though the federal Food and Drug administration said the SPF benefits \u201cmax out\u201d at 50. Not to mention a large amount of their products contain oxybenzone, \u201ca hormone-disrupting sunscreen filter.\u201d\n\nSunscreens are considered the worst if they come in spray form, which can be inhaled; offer SPF values above 50+; and/or harmful ingredients, such as oxybenzone and retinyl palmitate. The latter is believed to trigger skin damage, even cancer. The EWG estimates more than half of the sunscreens on the American market would not be allowed on European store shelves, which typically meet \u201chigher standards for UVA protection\u201d; American products are considered \u201cweak\u201d in comparison.\n\nHere's a list of the \"11 worst spray sunscreens\":\n\nBanana Boat Clear UltraMist Ultra Defense MAX Skin Protect Continuous Spray Sunscreen, SPF 110\n\nCoppertone Sport High Performance AccuSpray Sunscreen, SPF 70\n\nCoppertone Sport High Performance Clear Continuous Spray Sunscreen, SPF 100+\n\nCVS Clear Spray Sunscreen, SPF 100\n\nCVS Sheer Mist Spray Sunscreen, SPF 70\n\nCVS Sport Clear Spray Sunscreen, SPF 100+\n\nCVS Wet & Dry Sunscreen Spray, SPF 85\n\nNeutrogena Fresh Cooling Sunscreen Body Mist, SPF 70\n\nNeutrogena Ultra Sheer Body Mist Sunscreen Spray, SPF 100+\n\nNeutrogena Ultra Sheer Body Mist Sunscreen Spray, SPF 70\n\nNeutrogena Wet Skin Sunscreen Spray, SPF 85+\n\nAnd here are the \"12 worst sunscreen lotions\":\n\nBanana Boat Sport Performance Sunscreen Lotion, SPF 100\n\nCoppertone Sport High Performance Sunscreen Lotion, SPF 100\n\nCoppertone Sport High Performance Sunscreen, SPF 75\n\nCoppertone Sport Sunscreen Stick, SPF 55\n\nCoppertone Ultra Guard Sunscreen Lotion, SPF 70+\n\nCVS Sport Sunstick Sunscreen, SPF 55\n\nCVS Sun Lotion Sunscreen, SPF 100\n\nCVS Sun Lotion Sunscreen, SPF 70\n\nNeutrogena Ultra Sheer Daily Liquid Sunscreen, SPF 70\n\nNO-AD Sunscreen Lotion, SPF 60\n\nNO-AD Sunscreen Lotion, SPF 85\n\nOcean Potion Protect & Nourish Sunscreen Lotion, SPF 70\n\nDon't worry;
