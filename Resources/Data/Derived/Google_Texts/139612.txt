Out of 25 countries that performed executions in 2015, China had the highest estimated number of executions (death penalty data are kept secret by the Chinese government). Iran was second with 977 executions; Pakistan ranked third with 320 executions; Saudi Arabia had 158; and the United States was in the top 5 with 28 executions, its lowest number since 1991.



The federal government continues to retain the death penalty for 41 capital offenses. In 19 US states the death penalty has been abolished. In 31 states the death penalty remains legal for crimes including murder, treason, and espionage.



In Nebraska, where the state legislature abolished the death penalty in 2015, citizens will vote in Nov. 2016 on a referendum to reinstate the death penalty.



Among the 2016 presidential candidates, Bernie Sanders opposes the death penalty, while Hillary Clinton, Ted Cruz, John Kasich, and Donald Trump support keeping capital punishment legal.
