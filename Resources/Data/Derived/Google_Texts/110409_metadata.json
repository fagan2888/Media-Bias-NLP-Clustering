In this scenario, in spite of Clinton\u2019s numerous \u201cthreats\u201d to rein in drug prices, allowing the re-importation of drugs, and allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, we believe it is highly unlikely Clinton will be able to pass these initiatives through a Republican controlled Congress. Conversely, the Republicans\u2019 efforts to repeal Healthcare Reform, would be thwarted by a Clinton veto as we do not anticipate the Republican obtaining the 2/3 votes to override a veto.\n\nThe report makes clear that it views the gridlock created by a Clinton administration paired with a GOP Congress as the rosiest picture for the health care industry.\n\nClinton has frequently boasted about her record during the 1990s. \u201cI fought really hard,\u201dshe said at a Democratic town hall earlier this month. \u201cThe insurance companies and the drug companies spent millions against me. I know what it\u2019s like to go up against the status quo and special interests.\u201d\n\nBut now, it appears, they\u2019re rooting for her.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "https://prod01-cdn06.cdn.firstlook.org/assets/static/browserconfig.xml", "og": {"site_name": "The Intercept", "description": "A 2016 outlook says Clinton would be good for the industry because she'd preserve the ACA and be unable to pass meaningful drug reform legislation.", "title": "Wall Street Analyst Says Hillary Clinton Would be the Best President for Health Care Investors", "url": "https://theintercept.com/2016/02/20/wall-street-analyst-says-hillary-clinton-would-be-the-best-president-for-healthcare-investors/", "image": "https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/02/wall-street-bull-feature-hero.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Intercept", "description": "A 2016 outlook says that Clinton would be good for the industry because she would preserve the Affordable Care Act and be unable to pass meaningful drug reform legislation.", "title": "Wall Street Analyst Says Hillary Clinton Would be the Best President for Health Care Investors", "image": "https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/02/wall-street-bull-feature-hero.jpg", "creator": "@the_intercept", "site": "@the_intercept", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"pages": 619459291436461}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://prod01-cdn07.cdn.firstlook.org/assets/static/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2903\"", "article_summary": "Amid a tense battle between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders over competing visions for health care, a leading Wall Street analyst has put out a report saying that Clinton would be the best candidate for health care investors.\nThe report makes clear that it views the gridlock created by a Clinton administration paired with a GOP Congress as the rosiest picture for the health care industry.\nI know what it\u2019s like to go up against the status quo and special interests.\u201dBut now, it appears, they\u2019re rooting for her.\nConversely, the Republicans\u2019 efforts to repeal Healthcare Reform, would be thwarted by a Clinton veto as we do not anticipate the Republican obtaining the 2/3 votes to override a veto.\nClinton has frequently boasted about her record during the 1990s."}
