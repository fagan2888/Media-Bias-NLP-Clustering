Consequently, doctors are spread too thin and are unable to keep up with their caseloads.\n\nAt the same time, patients, especially in remote areas, are unable to get the quality care they need...\n\nThere is a solution: robots.\n\nI've discovered a small, little-known company that will help solve the doctor shortage \u2014 and save lives in the process.\n\nIt will do this by using a machine that allows doctors to visit patients from anywhere in the world... and they can do it in minutes in their pajamas.\n\nDr. Robot\n\nThe robot stands five feet tall and has a large computer screen that projects the doctor's face.\n\nIt is armed with patients' digital medical records, a state-of-the-art navigation system, and a full arsenal of medical equipment, including a digital stethoscope, otoscopes (used to look in ears), and an ultrasound imaging system.\n\nWhen a doctor wants to visit a patient, he doesn't even need to set foot in the hospital...\n\nSimply by pushing a button on his iPad, the doctor can send the hospital-based robot to the patient's room. It moves by itself and has sensors to keep it from bumping into walls.\n\nA two-way video allows the doctor and the patient to see and speak with each other; and with a zoom feature, the doctor can read the patient's chart, see his reflexes, and even check his eyes for dilated pupils.\n\nIn other words, the robot allows the doctor to examine the patient as if he or she were in the room, and then determine the right course of action.\n\nIt is particularly useful for stroke victims, for whom every second counts.\n\nThis is very cool stuff...\n\nThe robot allows doctors to visit multiple hospitals and check on patients who could be thousands of miles apart. This technology truly breaks down geographic boundaries and provides expert health care to all parts of the country.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post:\n\nDignity Health, which runs Arizona, California, and Nevada hospitals, began using the telemedicine machines five years ago to diagnose patients suspected of suffering strokes \u2014 when every minute is crucial to prevent serious brain damage. The San Francisco-based health care provider now uses the telemedicine robots in emergency rooms and intensive-care units at about 20 California hospitals, giving them access to specialists in areas such as neurology, cardiology, neonatology, pediatrics and mental health. Regardless of where the patient is located, we can be at their bedside in several minutes,\" said Dr. Alan Shatzel, medical director of the Mercy Telehealth Network. \"Literally, we compress time and space with this technology. No longer does distance affect a person's ability to access the best care possible.\"\n\nFDA Says, \"Go!\"\n\nHere's the best part: The company just received FDA approval for their hospital robots.\n\nAnd get this: This small, little-known company is the only one to have the approval of the FDA, giving them a virtual monopoly on this technology.\n\nAlready they've dispatched robots to 20 hospitals, including UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles.\n\nBut this is only the beginning...\n\nThere are over 5,700 hospitals in the United States, 69,105 in China, and a total of 300,000 worldwide.\n\nThe growth potential is massive.\n\nAnd each robot doctor costs about $5,000.\n\nAccording to the most recent conference call, the reception to the robots has been positive \u2014 especially with the navigation capabilities and the ease of use with the iPad. And the company has plans to expand into other, non-medical businesses.\n\nMake no mistake; the future we all were led to believe would happen one day when we got old... is happening as we speak.\n\nThere is money to be made as robots change the way the world works.\n\nChristian DeHaemer\n\n@TheDailyHammer on Twitter\n\nSince 1995, Christian DeHaemer has specialized in frontier market opportunities.
