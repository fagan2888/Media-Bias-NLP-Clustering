To many, the Boston-based company is very much a chain. It has nearly three dozen locations stretching all the way down to Georgia. If Legal isn\u2019t a chain, then what is?\n\nThere isn\u2019t much in the way of a standardized definition.\n\nNew York City considers any restaurant with more than 15 locations nationwide a chain, and requires qualifying businesses to list calorie counts on their menus. For New York, then, it\u2019s all about a number. (The Affordable Care Act is supposed to eventually impose a similar rule across the country, defining chains by the number of locations, but the implementation of that part of the law has been delayed.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne restaurant group has suggested that a chain is any eatery with 10 locations, or one that crosses state borders. Others argue that it\u2019s a matter of whether or not the company is franchising.\n\nOthers still would say it\u2019s a matter of perception. You can probably count Legal owner Roger Berkowitz in that camp, as he told The Boston Globe over the summer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s dismissive. It\u2019s denigrating,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cWhen people hear it, psychologically they are shut off to the nuances of what makes us different and special. There is a built-in unsaid prejudice about chains. When you say chain, it\u2019s almost as if it\u2019s soulless.\u2019\u2019\n\nBerkowitz seems to be defending chains while disputing his own company\u2019s classification as one.\n\nOy vey.\n\nDefining \u2018chain\u2019 is an exercise in flimsiness because whether or not something is a chain is in the eye of the beholder, said Sharmila Chatterjee, a professor of marketing at MIT\u2019s Sloan School of Management.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about expectation, knowing what an outlet is and what the experience is going to be like,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nThat is probably why Legal wants to direct people to think of it as something distinct, something very un-chainlike. One of Legal\u2019s ads features Berokowitz saying: \u201cEach of our restaurants is unique, not cookie-cutter.\u2019\u2019\n\nShould the number of locations matter? And if so, how many locations puts a business in the chain category?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to put a number on it,\u2019\u2019 said Chatterjee. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s five. Maybe it\u2019s three. \u2026 If you have one restaurant in Boston, one in San Francisco, and one in Florida, that\u2019s probably not going to immediately trigger the perception of a chain.\u2019\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Chatterjee said, a restaurant with a few locations in one region may be perceived as a chain and still develop loyalty among clientele due to its local roots.\n\n\u201cIt gets at the difference between local, regional, and national chains,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nBut that\u2019s just Chatterjee\u2019s own perception\u2014albeit, one grounded in expertise. The best answer to what constitutes a chain is, again, in the eye in the beholder. So, let\u2019s put it to the beholders.\n\nBelow are 10 regional eateries with multiple locations. Well, one of them only has one location and is planning a second. We\u2019re pretty sure it\u2019s not a chain, but chains, in a way, aren\u2019t unlike pornography: You know it when you see it.\n\nWe\u2019ll start you off with an easy one.\n\nA California Dunkin\u2019 Donuts. \u2014REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni\n\nDunkin\u2019 Donuts\n\nLocations: Around 11,000\n\nFirst location: Quincy\n\nFurthest location from first?
