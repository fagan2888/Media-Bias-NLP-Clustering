He has been declining in recent polling in New Hampshire and Iowa, as businessman Donald Trump has risen to the top.\n\n\u201cWhat you are seeing right now is the expression of a lot of frustration that voters have, particularly Republicans. They are like, \u2018We elected Republicans in the Senate. They are not getting it done,\u2019 and I think that\u2019s the big frustration out there.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s August,\u201d he said. \u201cI know there is a whole lot of hysteria about things early on. I\u2019ve found watching over the years and having been now a bunch of times in New Hampshire that people in New Hampshire are smart. They pay attention to the details. They are in for the long haul. They\u2019re not just into the media hype nationally.\u201d\n\nWalker and his campaign disclosed to WMUR.com that he will make his sixth visit to New Hampshire of 2015 next week. The three-day trip will begin at a Republican Education Summit at Londonderry High School on Wednesday. Later Wednesday, he will participate in a town hall at Turbocam in Barrington and attend a house party in Derry hosted by longtime activist Chris Wolfe.\n\nWalker on Thursday will make campaign stops in Sullivan and Grafton counties, including a town hall in Ashland. He will wrap up the trip with an appearance at a Politics and Eggs event Friday morning, Aug. 21.\n\nWalker also told WMUR.com that he will return on Labor Day weekend and \u201cwill be traveling on a Harley through all 10 counties of the state.\u201d\n\nWith the renewed focus on New Hampshire, he said he is confident that he will regain the strong standing he enjoyed in the state earlier this year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep doing things that allow voters in New Hampshire to see us for who we are, to ask questions, to put us on the spot,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Trump leads in New Hampshire and Iowa polling, Kasich has made a surge in the Granite State after a strong showing in last week\u2019s Fox News debate and an attention-grabbing visit to the state this week.\n\nChristie has been to the state more often than either Walker or Kasich and is also returning next week.\n\nWalker said Kasich is \u201ca good guy\u201d and has \u201ca solid record in Ohio.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a couple of differences between me and any of the other governors on the (debate) stage the other night, meaning Gov. Christie and Gov. Kasich,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t take the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare,\u201d as Kasich and Christie did. \u201cI think that\u2019s important to a lot of Republicans -- that I didn\u2019t further Obamacare.\"\n\nAnd, he said, \u201cMy state has a fully funded pension system. Wisconsin and South Dakota are the only ones in the country, so that makes me unique from the other governors.\u201d\n\nWalker also said he \u201ctook on the big government union bosses and actually won those battles. Ohio went through a similar battle. God bless him for trying, but in the end they weren\u2019t able to sustain those reforms. We sustained them in Wisconsin and our state is much better because of it.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s lead in the GOP polling is not a surprise, Walker said.\n\nBut he said that he is the best remedy for the voters\u2019 frustration \u201cbecause I don\u2019t just fight about it. I fight. I win. I don\u2019t just win elections. I actually get results and I\u2019ve done it without compromising my conservative principles.\n\n\u201cThe voters are upset, and what they really want is for someone to do what they say they are going to do,\u201d he said.\n\nWalker noted that in addition to Trump, voters also appear to be attracted to neurosurgeon Ben Carson and former business executive Carly Fiorina \u2013 \u201cfolks who have never been elected to office.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that is a common thread of frustration,\u201d he said. \u201cI get it. I hear it. People say, \u2018Hey why haven\u2019t they put a bill on the president\u2019s desk to repeal Obamacare? Why have they allowed this Iran deal to go through? Why have they done nothing on Dodd-Frank?\n\n\u201cFor me at least, I think the more times I can come back to New Hampshire and have town hall meetings and listen to people and respond to their concerns -- I came in in 2010. I came in because of this wave of concern. And I, quicker than any governor in America, took on the status quo. And not just in the other party.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe got it done and we did it right off the bat in a blue state.\u201d\n\nWalker was asked to weigh into the decades-long debate between Wisconsin and New Hampshire Republicans over the birthplace of the Republican Party.\n\n\u201cRipon, Wisconsin, of course,\u201d he said, naming a city in his home state which, like Exeter, claims the distinction.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Thu, 13 Aug 2015 15:41:19 EDT", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "John DiStaso", "og": {"site_name": "WMUR", "description": "Wisconsin Gov.
