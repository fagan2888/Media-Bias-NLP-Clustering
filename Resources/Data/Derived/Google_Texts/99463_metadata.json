Billups said he is \u201chome\u201d working at DU, but there was a time not too long ago that he was completely out of basketball.\n\nBillups completed his three-year playing career at DU in 2005. He knew he wasn\u2019t good enough to play at a professional level like his older brother Chauncey, perhaps the greatest player to ever come out of Denver. He thought he was done with the sport.\n\nFor Rodney Billups, it was time to try something new.\n\n\u201cI was involved in an investment company and later a personnel lifestyle company,\u201d Billups said of his 3\u00bd years away from basketball. \u201cI was successful at both, but there wasn\u2019t any passion. I missed basketball.\u201d\n\nBillups returned to the game he loves six years ago, joining Tad Boyle\u2019s staff at the University Colorado. The past four seasons he was an assistant coach. From that experience he brings knowledge of what it will take to get DU into the NCAA Tournament, where CU has been a regular participant in the Boyle era.\n\nWhen the DU administration decided to fire coach Joe Scott, it moved quickly to hire Billups.\n\n\u201cRodney Billups had been on our radar for some time,\u201d said Ryan Peck, DU\u2019s associate chancellor for external affairs. \u201cWe were able to move quickly because we knew about him.\u201d\n\nBoyle believes Billups can be an outstanding head coach.\n\n\u201cThere will be a learning curve as there is with any new coach,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cRodney had a big part in our success. He\u2019s ready to accept the challenges of being a head coach.\u201d\n\nAs a first-time head coach, there isn\u2019t any history on how his teams will play. Lonnie Porter, the former coach at Regis University and a longtime friend of the Billups family, has an opinion.\n\n\u201cI think his teams will play the way he played,\u201d Porter said. \u201cHe always played aggressively.\u201d\n\nBillups isn\u2019t hiding his game plan. He said he\u2019d stress defense and defensive rebounding. He favors a man-to-man defense, and he likes to play at a fast tempo.\n\nFormer CU coach Ricardo Patton, who once declined to sign Rodney Billups to play at the school, will join the DU staff April 1. Billups has one scholarship to fill. He\u2019s already working on adding a game against CU on DU\u2019s nonconference schedule. He\u2019s also working to get more DU students interested in basketball.\n\n\u201cI dreamed about going to CU and following in my brother\u2019s (Chauncey\u2019s) footsteps,\u201d Rodney Billups said. \u201cThe coaches didn\u2019t think I was good enough to play up there. I agreed that Chauncey was a better player at that stage, but I didn\u2019t think the comparison was fair because he was bigger. I knew I never would be an NBA player.\u201d\n\nBut there was no rivalry between the brothers.\n\n\u201cWe never talked about it at home,\u201d Rodney Billups said. \u201cBut it was a problem for me when I was going into high school. I used it as motivation.\u201d\n\nBillups not only is glad to be back at DU, but also happy to be back in Denver.\n\n\u201cI love Denver. My parents still live in the same house I grew up in. I go there all the time.\u201d\n\nIrv Moss: 303-954-1296, imoss@denverpost.com or @irvmoss", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rodney Billups finds his way back to basketball", "title": "Rodney Billups finds his way back to basketball", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/26/rodney-billups-finds-his-way-back-to-basketball/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-26T23:28:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-26T23:28:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado, University of Denver"}, "article_summary": "\u201cRodney Billups had been on our radar for some time,\u201d said Ryan Peck, DU\u2019s associate chancellor for external affairs.\nFor Rodney Billups, it was time to try something new.\nRodney Billups realized he was walking down the wrong career path, but it took him a while to find his way back to the game he loved.\n\u201cWe never talked about it at home,\u201d Rodney Billups said.\n\u201cI dreamed about going to CU and following in my brother\u2019s (Chauncey\u2019s) footsteps,\u201d Rodney Billups said."}
