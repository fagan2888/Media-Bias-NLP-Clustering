Bermudez Jr., of 10413 Ray Street, after he told deputies he ambushed Reyes at a residence in Ruskin on the night of Aug. 30, deputies said.\n\nBermudez also identified the location of Reyes\u2019 grave and told detectives that Reyes\u2019 pickup truck had been taken to an empty lot and burned, according to a release from the Hillsborough County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nThe Hillsborough County Sheriff\u2019s office identified Reyes\u2019 body Sunday, and the medical examiner later ruled his official cause of death as \u201chomicidal violence.\u201d His pickup was found burned on Shell Point Road in Ruskin on Aug. 31, deputies said.\n\nBermudez also faces charges of kidnapping, robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery, the sheriff\u2019s office said.\n\nReyes, 36, had six children, ranging in age from 18 to 4, and was separated from his wife, according to his niece, Juanita Reyes.\n\nShe said the family is struggling to understand what happened to her uncle and why.\n\n\u201cThis would have been the last thing we expected for anybody to do to him,\u201d Juanita Reyes said. \u201cHe was a very hard worker, very dedicated.\u201d\n\nReyes said her uncle was a welder who worked in Ft. Lauderdale, but often stayed with her in Riverview on weekends.\n\nOctavio Reyes was reported missing on Aug. 31 after leaving his home on Woodside Drive the previous day to go to Club 301, deputies said. A family member last saw him in the parking lot of a store on Gibsonton Drive at 10:20 p.m. Aug 30.\n\nJuanita Reyes said her uncle had been laid-off from a welding job, but was scheduled to return to work after Labor Day. She said her uncle spent much of his leisure time around his children, and liked to go to a shooting range.\n\n\u201cHe had a registered gun and he liked to do that in his off time,\u201d she said.\n\nJuanita Reyes said the family must delay making funeral arrangements until they receive his body from the sheriff\u2019s office. She said her cousins and other family members were at her home on Sunday, trying to piece together what could have happened.\n\nShe didn\u2019t know of her uncle having any enemies.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 14 Sep 2014 12:04:36 -0400", "Description": "RUSKIN \u2014 A Gibsonton man faces first-degree murder charges after investigators say he confessed to robbing, kidnapping and beating Octavio Reyes, whose body was found in woods Saturday off U.S.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "RUSKIN \u2014 A Gibsonton man faces first-degree murder charges after investigators say he confessed to robbing, kidnapping and beating Octavio Reyes, whose body was found in woods Saturday off U.S.", "title": "Gibsonton man charged in death of man found in woods", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/breaking-news/investigation-continues-into-body-found-in-ruskin-20140914/", "image": {"width": 306, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140914/ARTICLE/140919445/EP/1/1/EP-140919445.jpg", "height": 402}, "updated_time": "2014-09-14T22:13:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "RUSKIN \u2014 A Gibsonton man faces first-degree murder charges after investigators say he confessed to robbing, kidnapping and beating Octavio Reyes, whose body was found in woods Saturday off U.", "title": "Gibsonton man charged in death of man found in woods", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140914/ARTICLE/140919445/AR/0/AR-140919445.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-09-14T12:04:36Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-09-14T22:13:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "javier bermudez,mug shot,murder,octavio reyes"}, "article_summary": "Bermudez also faces charges of kidnapping, robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery, the sheriff\u2019s office said.\nJuanita Reyes said the family must delay making funeral arrangements until they receive his body from the sheriff\u2019s office.\nBermudez also identified the location of Reyes\u2019 grave and told detectives that Reyes\u2019 pickup truck had been taken to an empty lot and burned, according to a release from the Hillsborough County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\nA family member last saw him in the parking lot of a store on Gibsonton Drive at 10:20 p.m. Aug 30.\nRUSKIN \u2014 A Gibsonton man faces first-degree murder charges after investigators say he confessed to robbing, kidnapping and beating Octavio Reyes, whose body was found in woods Saturday off U.S. 41 near the Little Manatee River, deputies said."}
