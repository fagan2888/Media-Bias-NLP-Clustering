It's the only insurer in Virginia that has told the state Bureau of Insurance it will do so, BOI spokesman Ken Schrad said.\n\nGolden Rule, which covers about 13,000 people in Virginia, is affiliated with larger UnitedHealthcare, but United hasn't announced plans to keep its older policies in place. A company spokesman did not respond to the Daily Press' requests for comment Tuesday.\n\nThe policies in question are individual-market-type policies, not the group coverage policies many employees get through large employers.\n\nGolden Rule sent its customers letters last month, telling people who expected to have their old policies canceled that they could keep them simply by continuing to pay premiums. Those who had already chosen a new plan could make the transition, the company said, or potentially go back to their old plan.\n\nThis became possible in Virginia last month after the General Assembly passed, and Gov. Terry McAuliffe signed, legislation allowing it. Federal regulations in the ACA required the more robust, and often more expensive, policies, but older policies were grandfathered in after a public outcry.\n\nPresident Obama, and other politicians, had promised people they could keep policies they liked, and many were surprised to get cancellation letters.\n\nThe grandfathering required a change at the state level, though. Virginia legislators failed to pass that legislation at least twice this year before coming together nearly unanimously on the issue Nov. 10.\n\nState Sen. Thomas K. \"Tommy\" Norment, R-James City, sponsored that bill in the Senate, and Del. David Yancey, R-Newport News, sponsored companion legislation in the House.\n\nAt the time, a number of legislators, and some in the insurance industry, said it was too late for companies to keep old policies in place. Letters had already gone out, they said, people were transitioning to new plans and there would be too many bureaucratic and regulatory hoops to jump through.\n\nGolden Rule spokeswoman Ellen Laden said her company was ready to go when the legislation passed.\n\n\"I think the process worked well and went smoothly,\" she said.\n\nAnthem's spokesman said backtracking would have required new rate submissions to the Virginia Bureau of Insurance, which would need to approve those rates. Open-enrollment for new Obamacare policies began Nov. 15, further complicating things, he said in an email.\n\nAnthem is easily Virginia's largest health insurer by market share. Golden said its plans have 3 million members here.\n\n\"Anthem will continue the transition of its members to ACA-compliant plans as planned,\" Golden said in his email.\n\nGeorge Clark, a Newport News insurance agent who lobbied the General Assembly to pass its legislation last month, questioned Anthem's unwillingness to backtrack. He said the needed infrastructure to run the old plans is already in place.\n\n\"They need to make it happen,\" Clark said. \"Where there's a will there's a way.\"\n\nFain can be reached by phone at 757-525-1759.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Virginia's biggest insurer won't grandfather plans, but at least one company will", "date": "2014-12-02", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Daily Press", "author": "Daily Press", "og": {"site_name": "dailypress.com", "description": "Virginia's largest health insurer won't be grandfathering policies that don't meet Affordable Care Act standards, despite a last-minute change in state law that would allow it to do so.", "title": "Virginia's biggest insurer won't grandfather plans, but at least one company will", "url": "http://www.dailypress.com/news/politics/dp-nws-obamacare-policy-grandfather-20141202-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-547f1017/turbine/dp-nws-obamacare-policy-grandfather-20141202", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp08.15", "twitter": {"site": "@daily_press", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=397500600, app-argument=http://www.dailypress.com/deeplinkid/82158611", "fb": {"page_id": 140388628320, "app_id": 515474311837346}, "googlebot-news": "index", "keywords": "Obamacare health insurance ACA", "news_keywords": "Obamacare health insurance ACA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "Virginia's largest health insurer won't be grandfathering policies that don't meet Affordable Care Act standards, despite a last-minute change in state law that would allow it to do so."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe06ee\"", "article_summary": "He said the needed infrastructure to run the old plans is already in place.\nA smaller player in the Virginia market, Golden Rule, will grandfather policies.\nGolden Rule spokeswoman Ellen Laden said her company was ready to go when the legislation passed.\nGolden Rule, which covers about 13,000 people in Virginia, is affiliated with larger UnitedHealthcare, but United hasn't announced plans to keep its older policies in place.\nGolden Rule sent its customers letters last month, telling people who expected to have their old policies canceled that they could keep them simply by continuing to pay premiums."}
