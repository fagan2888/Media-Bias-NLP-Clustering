But a temporary operation sprung up Saturday morning in Don and Barbara Hall\u2019s garage at the end of a subdivision cul-de-sac.\n\nAt the start of a final-weekend push before Tuesday\u2019s election, congressional candidate Andrew Romanoff\u2019s campaign returned to the Highlands Ranch home that hosted its first house party in the area, in early 2013. This year, two staffers (one for the Romanoff campaign, the other here to help U.S. Sen. Mark Udall\u2019s re-election) are staying in their basement. The Halls, led by Barbara\u2019s Democratic activism, long have helped out campaigns.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re going to be ready for Hillary,\u201d said Don Hall, 62.\n\nAs about two dozen or so volunteers prepared for door-knocking or phone calls to encourage voters to return their mail ballots, Barbara Hall, 63, said there was no question she\u2019d offer her home to help Romanoff\u2019s bid to defeat the three-term incumbent, U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman in the highly competitive district, which also includes more-Democratic Aurora.\n\n\u201cI love Highlands Ranch,\u201d Hall said, \u201cbut I do not like the fact that it\u2019s so heavily Republican that we do not have a voice,\u201d with Republican registrants in the county outnumbering Democrats more than 2-to-1.\n\n\u201cIn Douglas County, we\u2019ve had so much trouble with the school board, and it\u2019s just so important to let people know that there\u2019s another choice out there,\u201d she said.\n\nThe couple\u2019s yard was the only one on the block with a campaign sign, for Romanoff. They said this was the first year they could remember their lonely Democratic signs not being stolen.\n\nWatch Romanoff video.\n\nRomanoff showed up just after 10 a.m., midway through his morning schedule of canvassing kickoffs across the district, and was greeted with enthusiastic applause. Inside the garage, next to a table with snacks, he opened in Spanish, then mentioned Thursday\u2019s all-Spanish debate with Coffman on the Univision affiliate, a first for Colorado candidates.\n\n\u201cTurns out, Mike Coffman\u2019s record doesn\u2019t sound any better in other languages,\u201d Romanoff deadpanned.\n\nAlso on hand were Bette Davis, a state Senate candidate, and Henry M. Barlow, a state House candidate, both Democrats aware they\u2019re running against the odds to represent the heavily GOP area.\n\nLater Saturday, I visited Coffman\u2019s campaign office in Aurora and blogged separately about his activities here.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Andrew Romanoff,Bette Davis,Henry M.
