A new report, released Wednesday by Arkansas\u2019 Medicaid task force, brings these warnings to life.\n\nThe report highlights four key vulnerabilities in the state\u2019s Medicaid program, a program originally designed to help truly vulnerable Arkansans. But it\u2019s now clearer than ever that tens of thousands of other Arkansans \u2013 and even non-Arkansans \u2013 are benefiting immensely from the generosity of taxpayers, stealing limited resources from the truly needy.\n\nTens of thousands of Medicaid enrollees have out-of-state addresses.\n\nAccording to the report, nearly 43,000 Arkansas Medicaid enrollees have addresses outside of the Natural State. Most of those addresses appear to be from neighboring states, none of which expanded Medicaid through ObamaCare as Arkansas did in 2014.\n\nRather than becoming a \u201cgood jobs magnet\u201d as ObamaCare supporters had promised, the state is quickly turning into a Medicaid magnet \u2013 and not just for its neighbors.\n\nIn fact, several thousand Medicaid enrollees reside in states as far away as Florida, California, and Michigan. And nearly all of them had out-of-state addresses before they were authorized to receive Medicaid in Arkansas. Worse yet, the report identified 7,000 enrollees who appear to have never lived in the state.\n\nTens of thousands of enrollees have suspicious identities.\n\nArkansas isn\u2019t just providing Medicaid to people in other states. It\u2019s also providing welfare to identity thieves.\n\nAccording to the state\u2019s consultants, tens of thousands of enrollees also have \u201chigh-risk identities.\u201d These individuals have identities that have been linked to multiple people, have Social Security numbers that are not found anywhere else in public records, and even have SSNs that were issued by the federal government before the enrollee was ever born.\n\nHundreds of enrollees died before they were ever authorized to receive Medicaid.\n\nArkansas is also granting Medicaid benefits to hundreds of enrollees who, according to public records, are already dead. More than half of these deceased enrollees actually died more than two years before signing up for Medicaid.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if these individuals were enrolled in Medicaid, but later died and were never removed from the program. These individuals didn\u2019t even sign up until two or more years after they died. That means either there are hundreds of zombies enrolling in Medicaid or fraudsters are deliberately assuming their identities in order to scam the system.\n\nThousands of enrollees have property values over $100,000.\n\nThe initial audit identified more than 12,000 enrollees who owned property worth more than $100,000. Although possessing property is not itself an indication of fraud, it can often serve as a warning sign that enrollees with significant assets have more income than they have reported.\n\nThis warning sign is especially important for recent purchases, which could indicate a recent change in income. The auditors singled out two enrollees in particular who had recently purchased expensive properties in Florida and New Jersey, worth $419,000 and $750,000 respectively.\n\nEvery dollar spent on ineligible enrollees is a dollar stolen from the truly needy.\n\nWelfare fraud doesn\u2019t just waste taxpayers\u2019 hard-earned money. It also steals limited resources from truly needy patients. It steals resources from children like Chloe Jones, a young Arkansan who\u2019s been forced to engage in years of costly litigation, fighting for her right to life-saving medication that the state denied her in order to save money. Meanwhile, taxpayers are footing the bill for folks who are buying luxury homes in Florida and New Jersey? It\u2019s almost too much to believe.\n\nThere are thousands of people just like Chloe who are depending on these programs to survive. There are thousands more on waiting lists for needed services. Every dollar spent on the fraudster is a dollar that can\u2019t be spent helping these truly needy Americans.\n\nThankfully, states can curb this epidemic. Enhanced screening at the front door, coupled with periodic checkups and prosecution of those found to be defrauding taxpayers, can greatly reduce the type of fraud Arkansas is currently uncovering. These reforms have witnessed broad, bipartisan support from Illinois to Pennsylvania to Massachusetts. And they\u2019ve produced tremendous results.\n\nIn the end, states that pursue these types of reforms will save taxpayer dollars, and that\u2019s critical. But more importantly, resources will be freed up for people like Chloe. Isn\u2019t that something we can all support?", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Government Accountability Office routinely warns that states welfare programs are at high risk for waste, fraud, and abuse.
