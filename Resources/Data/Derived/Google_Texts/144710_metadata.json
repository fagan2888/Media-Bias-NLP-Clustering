You can use it to pretend you\u2019re calling from any other number of your choosing.\n\nThe Dallas Morning News Watchdog figured out the scam after a Rowlett resident notified me of a series of calls she received.\n\nShe wrote me, \u201cIt would be remiss of me to not let you know that I have been getting numerous cell phone calls from what I suspect to be roofing scammers. I did answer the phone one evening last week and sure enough, the individual said they were going to be in my neighborhood looking at damaged roofs. Then asked me if I was going to be home. I do live in Rowlett and am very much blessed my home was not hit by the tornado.\n\n\u201cHere are all the numbers I have on my cell phone. [10 numbers were provided.] If I call the number, sometimes it just rings, or I receive a \u201cthe number has been disconnected\u201d recording. They must really have lots of phones! These numbers have been added to my Calls Blacklist. I have checked the website for Caller Complaints, all show location as Rowlett.\u201d\n\nThe Watchdog called all the numbers. Most didn\u2019t answer or weren\u2019t working. But one was the tipoff:\n\nA voice mail message states: \u201cHello. If you have received a call from this phone number and I do not know you, this was a not a call from us. Our phone has been spoofed and is under investigation. I apologize for any inconvenience. Thank you.\u201d\n\nAs The Watchdog, I\u2019ve been showing examples of roofers and contractors coming into Rowlett and Garland and misbehaving.\n\nOver the weekend, I hosted \u201cA Tornado Town Hall\u201d with the latest information on matters such as this.\n\nYou can watch a highlights video here:\n\nSee what member of the audience learned here:\n\nDownload your own copy of The Watchdog\u2019s Cheat Sheet to Hire a Good Roofer or General Contractor.\n\nThis is why \u2014 as The Watchdog \u2014 I\u2019ve announced that I\u2019ll lead a campaign to pass a roofer/contractor licensing law in Texas in the 2017 Texas Legislature.
