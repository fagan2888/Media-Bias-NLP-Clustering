REUTERS/Jason Reed (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS EDUCATION TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY) - RTXZSZC\n\n3999428\n\nSome people getting switched to new expensive health insurance plans under Obamacare might not even be aware of it \u2014 until it\u2019s too late.\n\nIf you have an insurance plan that isn\u2019t compatible with the Affordable Care Act, your insurance company might be automatically rolling you into the plan \u201cmost similar\u201d to your own.\n\nFor one Washington state resident interviewed by The Daily Caller, his new \u201cBronze\u201d plan is 80 percent more expensive for him and his wife. His wife is paying $220 more and he\u2019s paying $150 more with higher deductibles.\n\nBe sure to check all the mail you\u2019re getting from your insurance company. They have to notify you 90 days in advance if they\u2019re going to automatically switch you, according to federal law.\n\nAt least one insurance company carrying out this policy said that it has few options available to prevent lapses in coverage for their customers under Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThe letters went out in September. People had the three [SIC] options: to do nothing and get rolled over Jan. 1, and the other option was to either talk to Regence and get another plan,\u201d Rachelle Cunningham, strategic communications manager for RegenceBlueShield in Washington state told TheDC.\n\n\u201cWe asked them to let us know by Nov. 6 in the letter. \u2026 Even if they\u2019re rolled over effective Jan. 1, they still have until the 31st to cancel.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a confusing thing for people. Most of the plans didn\u2019t contain all the provisions that were under the law. We had no choice,\u201d Cunningham said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make it clear for them.\u201d\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "Some people getting switched to new expensive health insurance plans under Obamacare might not even be aware of it", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Some people getting switched to new expensive health insurance plans under Obamacare might not even be aware of it --- until it's too late.
