I\u2019ll hear TV commercials where the music\u2019s ripping off sounds of mine, to the point I think it\u2019s me. Half the time, it\u2019s the Black Keys. The other half, it\u2019s a sound-alike song because they couldn\u2019t license one of mine. There\u2019s a whole world that\u2019s totally fine with the watered-down version of the original. \u201cSome people will hear that and say \u2018Oh, Jack White thinks he\u2019s the first person to play the blues.\u2019 But certain acts open up a market for a certain style. Amy Winehouse: Did she invent white soul? Wearing a beehive? No. But she did something brand new and fresh, altogether as a package, and you see who\u2019s in her wake, from the Duffys to the Lana Del Reys. Adele selling 20 million records? That would not have happened if Amy Winehouse was alive. The White Stripes did the same thing, and in our absence, you\u2019re gonna find someone to fill that. And you get a band like the Black Keys, who said they never heard of the White Stripes? Sure.\u201d\n\nBemoaning the fact that \u201cwe live in a sound bite, sensationalized age,\u201d and in the interest of wanting \u201cto continue the activities I have planned for the rest of my year as a musician, and not be hounded by nonsense throughout those experiences,\u201d White penned a lengthy apology and explanation for his comments on his personal website:", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"This got blown out of proportion and made into headlines,\" the rocker wrote on his personal website", "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"This got blown out of proportion and made into headlines,\" the rocker wrote on his personal website", "title": "Jack White apologizes to the Black Keys, Meg White, Adele, Amy Winehouse and everyone else he dissed in his Rolling Stone profile", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/01/jack_white_apologizes_to_the_black_keys_meg_white_adele_amy_winehouse_and_everyone_else_he_dissed_in_his_rolling_stone_profile/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/music-jack-white.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"This got blown out of proportion and made into headlines,\" the rocker wrote on his personal website", "creator": "@readingirl", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/music-jack-white.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Jack White apologizes to the Black Keys, Meg White, Adele, Amy Winehouse and everyone else he dissed in his Rolling Stone profile", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Jack White apologizes to the Black Keys, Meg White, Adele, Amy Winehouse and everyone else he dissed in his Rolling Stone profile", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Adele, Amy Winehouse, black keys, jack white, music industry, Rolling Stone", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb61c\"", "article_summary": "And you get a band like the Black Keys, who said they never heard of the White Stripes?\nThe White Stripes did the same thing, and in our absence, you\u2019re gonna find someone to fill that.\nTopics: Adele, Amy Winehouse, black keys, jack white, music industry, Rolling Stone, Entertainment News, NewsIn the grand tradition of celebrities wishing they had just gone with \u201cno comment,\u201d Jack White apologized Saturday for comments made in his recent Rolling Stone profile, in which he revived his ongoing feud with the Black Keys \u2013and took down large swaths of the music industry in the process.\nHalf the time, it\u2019s the Black Keys.\nThat would not have happened if Amy Winehouse was alive."}
