In local contests nationwide, voters gave a big thumbs-down to candidates and causes favored by the Democratic Party\u2019s far left.\n\nAre Americans tired of the proliferating nanny-state intrusions in their lives? Sure looks that way. From East Coast to West Coast, North to South, local voters on Tuesday mostly said \u201cno\u201d to activist government and radical social changes.\n\nObamaCare, pot legalization, the minimum wage and a host of other liberal initiatives went down in flames, while moderate to conservative candidates \u2014 and even a Tea Partyer or two \u2014 made gains. A few key results:\n\n\u0095 Kentucky: The state embraced ObamaCare, built its own exchange, expanded Medicaid and set up a nonprofit insurance co-op. Now, after its health co-op failed, voters elected anti-ObamaCare Republican Matt Bevin as governor by 53% to 44%. Newly elected Lt. Gov. Jenean Hampton is a Tea Party member and the first black to hold statewide office ever.\n\n\u0095 Virginia: The GOP kept its 21-19 edge in the Senate and 2-1 majority in the House of Delegates, repudiating Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who sought to expand Medicaid and enact harsh gun-control laws.\n\n\u0095 Texas: The so-called Houston Equal Rights Ordinance to guarantee gays, lesbians, transgender and 13 other classes of people \u201cequal rights\u201d was routed 61% to 39%. Foes successfully argued it would have let men dressed as women use women\u2019s bathrooms.\n\n\u0095 Washington: Tacoma rejected an immediate rise in the city\u2019s minimum wage to $15 an hour. Across the country in Maine, 58% of voters in Portland, the largest city, also rejected a $15/hour minimum.\n\n\u0095 Oregon: The liberal state knocked down a spate of proposed local tax hikes on sales and gasoline, and in Coos County enacted a powerful new gun rights law.\n\n\u0095 Ohio: A move to legalize marijuana for recreational use was nixed by 65% of voters. Even many libertarian supporters didn\u2019t like the proposal, which would have created a monopoly to control pot sales.\n\n\u0095 California: Ultraliberal San Francisco voters rejected Prop. F, a measure to curb Airbnb, an Uber-like app for short-term home rentals. Voters also fired Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi after an illegal alien he let out of jail murdered tourist Kate Steinle last July.\n\nTuesday\u2019s losses were so bad that even the White House took note, issuing a statement disavowing any responsibility by President Obama for the debacle.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d be reluctant to draw significant conclusions,\u201d said White House spokesman Josh Earnest. Not so reluctant was the liberal Washington Post: \u201cPresident Obama is toxic, even in nonfederal elections,\u201d it said.\n\nBased on Tuesday\u2019s results, the progressive strain of Obamaism that has so damaged our nation\u2019s economy and civic life seems to have crested and crashed. We hope more electoral change is on the way.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Elections: Off-year elections can be revealing, and 2015's was no different.
