State police have arrested the driver responsible for a fatal crash that killed a child in Oxford back in September.

Garrett L. Baker, 30, of Waterbury, is charged with negligent homicide, distracted driving, reckless driving, and failure to drive right.

The head-on collision occurred on Route 188/Quaker Farms Road around 12:30 p.m. on Sept. 11 when a car driven by Baker, crossed over the center line and crashed into an oncoming Subaru Outback, according to police.

Five people were injured, including 3-year-old Lilly Brooks who died from her injuries.

Authorities said Baker received neck abrasions and his passenger, Nicole Bahr, 28, also of Waterbury, suffered arm injuries.

Baker was released on a $75,00 bond and is scheduled to appear in Derby Superior Court on March 3rd.
