On Fallon\u2019s show Friday, it went by virtually unnoticed.\n\nIn the heyday of Obamamania, when all those young invincibles had decided to stick it to The Man by voting in the country\u2019s first black president, Obama was untouchable. Now, with the Obamacare train wreck on full view, and those younger voters starting to get the message that someone has to pay for Democrat goodies \u2013 and that that someone is them, the jokes are stinging. Jay Leno\u2019s been leading the way, but he\u2019s playing to America.\n\nSo, for audiences the thrill might be gone \u2014 but the celebs are still fawning.\n\nRush Limbaugh\u2019s gatekeeper, \u2018Snerdley,\u2019 opens up\n\nAnd that showed at when the president picked him out of a crowd at a holiday gathering at the White House.\n\n\u201cHe called me \u2018Kev!\u2019\u201d Hart bubbled to Fallon. \u201cHe didn\u2019t call me Kevin Hart. He nicknamed me, which means me and the president are like this.\u201d He crossed his fingers. \u201cWe\u2019re best friends! That\u2019s my buddy!\u201d\n\nSo Obama\u2019s still a favorite with the Beautiful People \u2013 like every Democrat president since Kennedy \u2013 but his luster\u2019s getting a little second-term tarnish. Hart might be riding high at the moment \u2013 until next weekend, anyway, when \u201cRide Along\u201d rides away \u2013 but he\u2019s destined for B-listdom. And it\u2019s still a far cry from the A-listers who turned out for that disgraceful \u201cI pledge to be a servant to Barack Obama\u201d video back in 2009.\n\n(If you\u2019ve forgotten it, check out \u201cA little 1940s Germany\u201d story, here. )\n\nKevin Hart is no Demi Moore (for one thing, he\u2019s too short), and the guy who stars in BET\u2019s \u201cReal Husbands of Hollywood\u201d isn\u2019t exactly Morgan Freeman in crossover appeal.\n\nHe can still fill a late-night talk giggling about his school-girl crush on the president of the United States \u2013 you know \u201cB-Boogie\u201d to his friends.\n\nBut the audience isn\u2019t buying anymore.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "Maybe the \u201cB\u201d in B-list means brainless, but is the audience still buying?
