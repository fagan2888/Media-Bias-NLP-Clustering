Some of them, like issues of criminal justice and voting rights, are perhaps more starkly evident than others. But racial divides also impact other areas that haven\u2019t traditionally been associated with civil rights. Structures of racism and privilege continue to put a serious toll on the African American community\u2019s health \u2014 and contribute to the fact that black Americans are still dying younger than white Americans. Here\u2019s why racism is a serious public health issue:\n\nRacial discrimination puts black Americans at risk for long-term health problems.\n\nAccording to a new study, black teens who experience racial discrimination in adolescence are more likely to develop stress-related health issues that could put them at risk for chronic diseases later in life. Specifically, researchers found that they were more likely to have higher levels of blood pressure, a higher body mass index, and higher levels of stress-related hormones once they turned 20. The psychological toll that racism takes on adults has also been well-documented, and racial discrimination has been repeatedly linked to high blood pressure. Just the fear of racial discrimination can trigger stress-related responses, which means that many people of color who live within a society defined by racism are constantly under increased biological stressors.\n\nThe majority of doctors harbor \u201cunconscious racial biases\u201d toward their black patients.\n\nA 2012 study found that about two-thirds of primary care doctors harbor biases toward their African-American patients, leading those doctors to spend less time with their black patients and involve them less in medical decisions. Although doctors typically aren\u2019t aware that they\u2019re treating African-American patients any differently, this ultimately creates an environment in which black people often don\u2019t feel welcome in the medical system \u2014 and may start avoiding it. On top of that, black Americans are more likely to lack access to health insurance and less likely to have a regular doctor. This creates a situation in which African-Americans are dying from diseases at higher rates than other racial groups because they don\u2019t get treatment in time.\n\nBlack scientists are systematically underfunded.\n\nAccording to a recent analysis of grant data from the National Institute of Health (NIH), black scientists \u2014 and not other types of minorities \u2014 are less likely to receive government funding for a research project, even when they have the same credentials as their white peers. In fact, a black researcher\u2019s chances of winning an NIH grant is 10 percentage points lower than a white researcher\u2019s chances. Aside from the obvious issues with discriminating against qualified scientists, there\u2019s some evidence this could be having a lasting impact on the types of research that\u2019s conducted in this country. Research into diseases that disproportionately affect black people is underfunded, too \u2014 and people of color are underrepresented in clinical trials.\n\nDisparities in the health care sector continue to hit the African-American community the hardest.\n\nThanks to structures of racism and poverty that stretch back for generations, black Americans are still more likely to lack access to surgical and emergency medical care, more likely to patronize hospitals that employ less-experienced staff, and much less likely to receive high-quality primary care. That puts this community in a position to significantly benefit from some of the reforms included in the Affordable Care Act. But it also means that black Americans are hit the hardest by the political resistance to implementing health reform. Republican governors\u2019 ongoing resistance to the optional Medicaid expansion disproportionately harms African-Americans, particularly low-income black people living in the South.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Deeply ingrained systems of inequality are taking a toll on black Americans' health.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Deeply ingrained systems of inequality are taking a toll on black Americans' health.", "title": "Why Racism Is A Public Health Issue", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/02/03/3239101/racism-public-health-issue/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shutterstock_126687869.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Deeply ingrained systems of inequality are taking a toll on black Americans' health.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shutterstock_126687869-321x214.jpg", "title": "Why Racism Is A Public Health Issue", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shutterstock_126687869.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shutterstock_126687869.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-03T11:15:48+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Here\u2019s why racism is a serious public health issue:Racial discrimination puts black Americans at risk for long-term health problems.\nHealth Why Racism Is A Public Health Issue CREDIT: ShutterstockObviously, deeply ingrained racial inequality has a wide range of consequences here in the United States.\nBut it also means that black Americans are hit the hardest by the political resistance to implementing health reform.\nDisparities in the health care sector continue to hit the African-American community the hardest.\nThe psychological toll that racism takes on adults has also been well-documented, and racial discrimination has been repeatedly linked to high blood pressure."}
