So it's no wonder you may be finding it harder to find a doctor or to schedule an appointment with the one you have.\n\nWhat's fueling this problem? The baby boom generation pouring into older age, an aging physician workforce preparing to retire and an estimated 30 million Americans joining the ranks of the insured since enactment of the Affordable Care Act in 2010.\n\nWhat that means is that you may not be seeing a doctor at all the next time you go for health care.\n\n\"The impending physician shortage is an opportunity to move to a health care model where the physician can be more of a quarterback on a team of health care providers, rather than being on the front lines,\" said Dr. David Gorstein, managing director of Health Innovations, a health care consulting firm in Charleston, S.C., focusing on new models of health care. It's time to look to other, more affordable and accessible settings, he said.\n\nHere are five options for addressing shortages and reining in costs.\n\nRetail clinics\n\nMaybe you have a scratchy throat and suspect another cold, but there's a two-week wait to see your doctor. Or you're out of town on business or are self-employed without health insurance.\n\nTypically located in pharmacies, groceries and \"big box\" stores, these walk-in clinics began cropping up in 2000 and served more than 20 million patients in 2014, according to their trade association, the Convenient Care Association. To date, they number over 1,800 in 40 states and Washington, D.C., offering lower-cost options for health services with transparent pricing, so consumers know what they are paying for.\n\nVisits typically range from $40 to $75 and address acute conditions, such as bronchitis and ear infections, as well as provide immunizations and physicals. Usually staffed by nurse practitioners, who are highly trained registered nurses, some incorporate pharmacists into ongoing care (which is particularly valuable in medication counseling for chronic diseases like diabetes or asthma). The clinics generally accept health insurance and can send a record of your visit to your primary-care physician.\n\n\"While the care can be excellent and the wait times and cost to the patient much less than emergency rooms, it's important to understand that walk-in clinics only treat a limited list of problems,\" said Dr. John W. Rowe, professor of health policy and aging at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. They should not be relied on as a source of ongoing care, he cautioned. Yet Dr. Don Goldmann, chief medical and scientific officer at the Institute for Healthcare Improvement in Cambridge, Mass., sees their growth as proof that they fill important needs, providing \"easier access to providers and quick, convenient care.\"\n\nUrgent-care centers\n\nAlthough they've been around for decades, the more than 6,400 urgent-care centers in the U.S are seeing an upswing in growth (from 8,000 to 9,300 since 2008), fueled by consumer frustration with long waits in emergency rooms and for appointments with primary-care physicians. These same-day walk-in clinics focus primarily on emergency medicine for acute (but less severe) medical problems. Typically staffed by trained and licensed physicians and medical assistants, registered nurses and X-ray technicians, nearly one-third of them are hospital owned and operated.\n\nMany offer evening and weekend hours, perform X-rays and some on-site lab tests (like urinalysis and pregnancy and strep tests) and provide procedures like suturing and casting, usually more economically and with less wait time than hospital emergency rooms. In some communities, they function as primary-care practices for some patients. One study estimated that up to 27 percent of emergency room visits could be handled appropriately at retail clinics and urgent-care centers, offering cost savings of $4.4 billion per year.\n\nNurse-led practices\n\nNurse practitioners, nurse anesthetists, nurse midwives: You find them in every setting where patients receive care, including doctor's offices (where they often treat patients with more routine complaints, thus freeing up doctors), retail clinics, hospitals, nursing-care facilities, schools, clinics, free-standing practices and hospices. Known as advanced-practice registered nurses, or APRNs, they are nationally certified registered nurses who have completed master's or doctoral programs and have advanced clinical training in patient-centered primary care. They can practice independently in 19 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nNurse practitioners, a subgroup of APRNs, perform a range of duties, from diagnosing and treating conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, infections and injuries to prescribing medications, promoting disease prevention, and providing health education and counseling.\n\nAlthough U.S. nurse practitioners have been providing health care for half a century, the health care system now is seeing the benefits of patient access to nurse practitioner-provided health services, said Tay Kopanos, vice president, state government affairs for the American Association of Nurse Practitioners, who added that many patients are choosing NPs as their primary-care providers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates job growth for APRNs to rise by 31 percent between the years 2012 and 2022.\n\nCould physicians want to \"protect their turf\" by limiting the practice of nurse practitioners? \"I would think they'd welcome this arrangement,\" Gorstein said. \"The doctor would see the interesting patients \u2014 the ones who have more than a minor ear infection or sore throat \u2014 and also would be getting referrals and income from a network of NPs. This is the Walgreens and CVS clinic model; while not perfect yet, it's on the right track.\"\n\nTeam-based care\n\nThe average length of a health care visit is less than 15 minutes, hardly enough time to address all of a patient's needs. That's why many practices are creating physician-led teams. Nurses, doctors, community health workers and other health care providers work together so the patient receives comprehensive care.\n\nThis approach can be more efficient and effective, allowing more time with the professional who has the right expertise, said Dr. Andrew Morris-Singer, president of Primary Care Progress, a grass-roots organization working to revitalize the primary-care system.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "How health care will look with a physician shortage", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "The Association of American Medical Colleges projects that the nation will face a shortage of 12,000 to 31,000 primary-care physicians by 2025.
