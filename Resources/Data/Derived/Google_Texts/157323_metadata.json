Other messages were more grammatical, containing language copied directly from an email sent by Kyle Lierman, a liaison in the White House Office of Public Engagement, that encouraged players to promote Obamacare in the runup to the big game.\n\n\u201cFootball fans, hope you\u2019re getting ready for Super Bowl XLVIII, don\u2019t forget you can #getcovered at healthcare.gov,\u201d the Ravens linebacker tweeted earlier in the evening. That language was included word-for-word in Lierman\u2019s email to a representative at the NFL Players Association on Sunday suggesting \u201csome thoughts on what players could tweet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey can definitely change these up or put their own spin on these,\u201d Lierman said in the email, obtained by the Washington Free Beacon on Monday.\n\nMany, though, did not significantly change the suggested language. Ayanbadejo sent three tweets, all of which copied Lierman\u2019s suggested language with the exception of the typo in the last tweet.\n\nThe Ravens received a $130,000 contract from Maryland Health Connection, the state\u2019s Obamacare exchange, last year to promote Obamacare. The NFL decided to forego an agreement with officials in charge of the Obamacare rollout.\n\nAfter Ayanbadejo\u2019s first two tweets, he paused to express his hope that, \u201cone day in the near future there will be medicinal marijuana coverage for pain management,social anxiety&other medical benefits.\u201d\n\nHis third effort received a White House retweet, pursuant to assurances in Lierman\u2019s email.\n\n\u201cWhen folks tweet this out if they or you email me with their handle I can flag it for the @whitehouse and our other twitter handles to be retweeted, etc.,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAyanbadejo\u2019s tweet was the only one to be amplified by the official White House twitter account, but other players also repeated, verbatim or nearly so, Lierman\u2019s suggested language.\n\n\u201cFootball fans, hope you\u2019re getting ready for Super Bowl XLVIII, don\u2019t forget you can #getcovered at healthcare.gov,\u201d tweeted former wide receiver and confessed killer Donte Stallworth.\n\nStallworth also included the hashtag \u201cRockEnroll,\u201d which he credited to the Center for American Progress Action Fund and its campaigns director, Emily Tisch Sussman.\n\nStallworth, who pleaded guilty to DUI manslaughter in 2009, recently joined the CAP Action Fund for a pro-Obamacare \u201cflash mob\u201d in New York City and promoted the effort in an MSNBC appearance with Sussman.\n\nA source familiar with the players association\u2019s work in promoting Obamacare told the Free Beacon that the official forwarded Lierman\u2019s email to players\u2019 marketing representatives, who likely made their clients aware of the effort.\n\nThe NFLPA did not return a request for comment.\n\nNFL agent Drew Rosenhaus, who has represented Stallworth and Ayanbadejo, also tweeted a pro-Obamacare message that copied language directly from Lierman\u2019s email.\n\nFormer NFL defensive end Adewale Ogunleye, a former Rosenhaus client, also used Lierman\u2019s suggested language.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WH staffer promotes suggested language in Super Bowl Sunday email to NFLPA", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Obamacare got a boost from current and former National Football League players on Super Bowl Sunday after the White House sent suggested language for laudatory tweets to a representative of the league", "title": "White House Writes NFL Players\u2019 Pro-Obamacare Tweets", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/politics/white-house-writes-nfl-players-pro-obamacare-tweets/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/White-House-flickr-150x150.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obamacare got a boost from current and former National Football League players on Super Bowl Sunday", "creator": "@lachlan", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/White-House-flickr-150x150.jpeg", "title": "White House Writes NFL Players\u2019 Pro-Obamacare Tweets", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Former NFL defensive end Adewale Ogunleye, a former Rosenhaus client, also used Lierman\u2019s suggested language.\nAyanbadejo\u2019s tweet was the only one to be amplified by the official White House twitter account, but other players also repeated, verbatim or nearly so, Lierman\u2019s suggested language.\nBY: Follow @lachlanObamacare got a boost from current and former National Football League players on Super Bowl Sunday after the White House sent suggested language for laudatory tweets to a representative of the league\u2019s players union.\nNFL agent Drew Rosenhaus, who has represented Stallworth and Ayanbadejo, also tweeted a pro-Obamacare message that copied language directly from Lierman\u2019s email.\nAyanbadejo sent three tweets, all of which copied Lierman\u2019s suggested language with the exception of the typo in the last tweet."}
