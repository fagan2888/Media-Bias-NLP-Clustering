(as if you didn\u2019t know), Title V of the Republican bill to \u201crepeal and replace Obamacare\u201d contains some of the same constitutional problems that led 27 states to challenge Obamacare.

But Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 opinion in last year\u2019s \u201cObamacare\u201d case really knocks the props out from under them.\n\nUnder the proposed Title V of the American Health Reform Act, Congress would assume vast control over state judicial systems. Some of the bill\u2019s provisions would be reasonable if adopted at the state level. But for Congress to start micro-managing state courts and state juries should frighten anyone who cares about our American constitutional system.\n\nThis essay addresses four subjects. First, it outlines some of Title V\u2019s objectionable features. Second, it explains how advocates of the measure try to justify it constitutionally. Third, it shows why the proposal far exceeds congressional powers under our Constitution when that document is read as the Founders intended. Finally, it explains why the bill is likely unconstitutional under modern Supreme Court law as well\u2014and specifically under Chief Justice Roberts\u2019 Obamacare decision.\n\nWhat Title V Would Do.\n\nThe bill would rewrite personal injury law extensively\u2014and not just in federal courts administering federal law. It would intrude on state courts applying state law. For example, the bill requires state judges and juries to adopt federal standards of proof, federal standards of guilt, federal damage rules, and federal deadlines. It imposes rules for attorneys\u2019 fees that override both state law and private contracts. It even mandates that some useful information be withheld from juries.\n\nMany members of Congress were elected after affirming their commitment to federalism\u2014that is, to \u201cstates\u2019 rights.\u201d So Section 508 of the bill is entitled \u201cState Flexibility and Protection of States\u2019 Rights.\u201d But the title is misleading.\n\nThe very first sentence of Section 508 is about federal supremacy, not state flexibility. It reads, \u201cThe provisions governing health care lawsuits set forth in this subtitle preempt, subject to subsections (b) and (c), State law to the extent that State law prevents the application of any provisions of law established by or under this subtitle.\u201d\n\nAnd what of subsections (b) and (c)? They provide that states may establish rigid damage caps, but may not leave damages to the jury\u2014and that states may make it harder for plaintiffs to prevail, but not easier! In other words, a state may be \u201cflexible\u201d if it does what Congress likes, but not what Congress doesn\u2019t like.\n\nHow Supporters of Title V Try to Justify It.\n\nHow can advocates justify constitutionally this massive intrusion into state and local governance? They really can\u2019t. So they finesse the issue in precisely the same way the sponsors of Obamacare did: They invoke Constitution\u2019s much-abused Commerce Power.\n\nTheir argument has two components. First, they claim that the Founders crafted the Commerce Power broadly enough to allow Congress to intervene. Secondly, they claim that even if the Constitution, properly understood, does not authorize Title V, the Supreme Court still will uphold it under its modern Commerce Power jurisprudence.\n\nThe first claim is misrepresentation so gross as to be ludicrous. The second claim would be more plausible\u2014except that the discussion of the Commerce Power in Chief Justice Roberts\u2019 Obamacare decision kicked away much of its support.\n\nWhy Title V Violates the Founders\u2019 Design.\n\nIf there is one thing that can be asserted with absolute confidence about the American Founding, it is this: Federal control over state judges, state juries, and state tort law is emphatically NOT what the Founders intended. The Constitution created a federal government limited to enumerated (listed) powers, and the Founders did not design those powers to include federal control of state civil justice. The evidence on this point is overwhelming.\n\nIn 2011, I investigated the issue thoroughly, and reported my findings in a detailed paper entitled The Roots of American Judicial Federalism, available at http://constitution.i2i.org/files/2011/11/Roots_Am_Federalism.pdf. That paper showed that (1) a core reason the Founders fought the American Revolution was to assure local control of courts, (2) the Constitution was structured to achieve the same goal, and (3) leading Founders specifically represented\u2014not merely once or twice, but again and again\u2014that state civil justice systems and tort law would remain free of federal control. Despite a few half-hearted assertions to the contrary, the paper\u2019s conclusions have never been seriously challenged.\n\nThe Importance of the Obamacare Case: Why Title V Likely Violates Modern Commerce Power Doctrine.\n\nTechnically, the Commerce Power stems from two separate constitutional provisions. One is the Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3). It grants Congress authority \u201cto regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.\u201d By \u201cCommerce,\u201d the Founders did not mean everything economic. They meant trade among merchants, transportation, commercial paper, and a few associated activities. Contrary to widespread belief, the Supreme Court has never really changed this definition, except when it ruled in a 1944 case that \u201cCommerce\u201d also included insurance.\n\nThe other component of the Commerce Power is the Constitution\u2019s Necessary and Proper Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 18). This refers to Congress\u2019s authority to make laws \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d for carrying out its other powers. The Founders did not intend the Necessary and Proper Clause to actually give Congress additional authority. Its purpose\u2014as we know from 18th century legal sources and from statements from Founders such as Hamilton, Madison, and James Wilson\u2014was merely to inform the reader that the itemized powers should be read to include certain subsidiary or \u201cincidental\u201d authority.\n\nThe leading Supreme Court case on the Necessary and Proper Clause is McCulloch v. Maryland. In that case, Chief Justice John Marshall also explained that the Clause did not grant to Congress any \u201cgreat substantive and independent powers.\u201d Moreover, in Gibbons v. Ogden (the first great Commerce Power case) Marshall added that \u201chealth laws of every description\u201d were outside the federal sphere and exclusively reserved to the states. In other words, under the view of the greatest chief justice in American history, both Title V and Obamacare are utterly unconstitutional.\n\nSupporters of Title V nevertheless point out that the modern Supreme Court has allowed Congress to go beyond those limits. That is true: In 20th century cases such as Wickard v. Filburn (1942), the Court re-wrote the Necessary and Proper Clause to allow Congress more \u201cgreat substantive and independent powers.\u201d The problem for Title V\u2019s sponsors, however, is that Chief Justice Roberts has informed us that those days may be over.\n\nThe most famous part of his Obamacare opinion upheld the individual insurance mandate as a tax. But Roberts issued three other rulings as well:\n\n(1) The mandate was outside Congress\u2019s power under the Commerce Clause;\n\n(2) The mandate was outside Congress\u2019s power under the Necessary and Proper Clause; and\n\n(3) Obamacare\u2019s effort to force its Medicaid expansion on the states also violated the Necessary and Proper Clause.\n\nObservers who understand that the Supreme Court has not greatly expanded the Founders\u2019 definition of \u201ccommerce\u201d were not surprised by the first ruling. A mandate that someone buy insurance is not \u201ccommerce\u201d as the Constitution uses the term. Neither, for that matter, is a health care lawsuit.\n\nBut many found Roberts\u2019 second holding more surprising: Roberts announced a reversion to the original understanding of the Necessary and Proper Clause. Here is a passage from his opinion (with some punctuation removed):\n\nAlthough the Clause gives Congress authority to legislate on that vast mass of incidental powers which must be involved in the constitution, it does not license the exercise of any \u201cgreat substantive and independent power[s]\u201d beyond those specifically enumerated. . . . Instead, the Clause is merely a declaration, for the removal of all uncertainty, that the means of carrying into execution those [powers] otherwise granted are included in the grant. . . . [T]he individual mandate cannot be sustained under the Necessary and Proper Clause as an essential component of the insurance reforms. Each of our prior cases upholding laws under that Clause involved exercises of authority derivative of, and in service to, a granted power. . . . This is in no way an authority that is \u201cnarrow in scope\u201d or \u201cincidental\u201d to the exercise of the commerce power. . . .\n\nIn a Yale Law Journal article, Professor William Baude shows why this language is important: Roberts is saying that if the Constitution doesn\u2019t specifically give Congress a \u201cgreat substantive and independent power,\u201d then the Necessary and Proper Clause doesn\u2019t give it to Congress either.\n\nIs control of the state court systems a \u201cgreat substantive and independent power?\u201d You bet it is. The Founders clearly considered the judiciary a very important aspect of government, and the Constitution addressed it in detail. But while prescribing the rules for the federal courts, the framers deliberately omitted any federal role in the state judiciary. Here are some examples:\n\n* The Constitution provides for appointment of federal judges\u2014but not state judges.\n\n* It gives Congress authority to \u201cconstitute\u201d (create and regulate) lower federal courts\u2014but not state courts.\n\n* It defines the jurisdiction of the federal courts\u2014but not of the state courts.\n\n* It requires, in many cases, trial by jury in federal court\u2014but not in state court.\n\nThe Founders obviously deemed judicial organization and procedure to be a \u201cgreat and independent\u201d subject, worthy of much constitutional attention. Yet in all procedural and organizational particulars, they left state courts alone. They certainly granted Congress no power to micro-manage them. They left the \u201cgreat substantive and independent power\u201d of operating the state courts to the states themselves. Under Justice Roberts\u2019 opinion, that\u2019s where it stays.\n\nThe part of the opinion dealing with Medicaid buttresses this conclusion. For a 7-2 majority, the chief justice struck down Congress\u2019s efforts to dragoon the states into the Medicaid expansion. His was the latest in a long series of rulings in which the Supreme Court has protected state governments (legislatures, executives, and courts) from what the Court calls \u201ccommandeering.\u201d\n\nAs in previous cases, the Court held that \u201ccommandeering\u201d infringes core state sovereignty. Infringing core state sovereignty violates the Necessary and Proper Clause because a federal law attacking core state sovereignty is not \u201cproper.\u201d A federal statute dictating to state legislatures, judges, and juries how they manage lawsuits arising under their own state law is of that kind.\n\n* * * *\n\nOne reason for Congress\u2019s abysmal public approval rating is the perception that most members of Congress are hypocritical power-seekers. Most of the sponsors of Title V assert that Obamacare is an unconstitutional intrusion on the rights of the states and the people. Yet by supporting Title V they are promoting a bill that may be even more constitutionally suspect than Obamacare.\n\nFor their own political survival\u2014as well as for the Constitution and for constitutional principle\u2014those sponsors need to back off.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nReddit\n\nGoogle\n\nTumblr\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\n\n\nRelated posts", "article_metadata": {"description": "Title V of the Republican bill to \u201crepeal and replace Obamacare\u201d - with its tort-reform provisions contains some of the same constitutional problems that led 27", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Tenth Amendment Center", "description": "Just to show you that hypocrisy is alive and well in Washington, D.C.
