(Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)\n\nWe already know that a ruling against the Obama administration in King v. Burwell, this year\u2019s Affordable Care Act Supreme Court case, would be a public health disaster: Millions of people would lose insurance coverage, and insurance markets across the country would stumble out of balance. But what would happen to children, a vulnerable group with specific health-care needs that any rational society would address? The nonpartisan Urban Institute released an analysis Tuesday that games out the possibilities. The bottom line: In a worst-case scenario, a whopping 3.3 million more kids could end up without health coverage.\n\nOn its own, a Supreme Court ruling hostile to the Obama administration would result in 730,000 more uninsured children, because their parents would lose the ability to claim federal health insurance subsidies. But such a ruling would also magnify the negative effects of other potential changes in children\u2019s health care, which could result in a lot more pain, particularly for one bracket of low- and middle-income families.\n\nThe court will rule this year in the context of a larger debate about the federal government\u2019s childhood health programs. By September, Congress must renew funding for the key Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, also known as CHIP, otherwise states will have to taper or shut their CHIP programs. As many as 1.1 million children could lose coverage if Congress fails to provide more money. Lawmakers might also relax rules requiring states to maintain Medicaid coverage levels for some low-income children. Doing that, too, would increase the number of additional uninsured kids to 2 million.\n\nIf the court struck down Obamacare insurance subsidies in the majority of states, its ruling would make these consequences worse, because some families wouldn\u2019t be able to seek affordable coverage in Obamacare\u2019s private insurance marketplaces, either. With negative effects stacking on top of one another, the number of additional uninsured children would be 3.3 million, and the children\u2019s uninsurance rate would jump from 3.6 percent under current policy to a sad 7.8 percent.\n\nBecause of certain program rules, the effects would be particularly bad for children in families between 138 and 200 percent of the federal poverty line, which equates to a yearly income between $33,465 and $48,500 for a family of four. Their uninsurance rate could shoot from 5.4 percent to 27.3 percent.\n\nTrue, the Urban Institute\u2019s researchers modeled a worst-case scenario. A ruling against the Obama administration in June could adjust Congress\u2019s thinking about what to do on CHIP and Medicaid in September. Senior Republicans also seem keen to cut, not eliminate, CHIP funding this year. But Urban\u2019s analysis suggests that the court could nevertheless exacerbate the negative effects of funding cuts, too.\n\nThe court must interpret laws according to more than just its preferred policy outcomes. But no one \u2014 not the justices, not the Obama administration\u2019s critics and certainly not anyone concerned with children\u2019s health \u2014 should prefer the future that the Urban Institute projects.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A perfect storm for children's health insurance.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/strombergsteve", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A perfect storm for children's health insurance.", "title": "What would happen to children if the Supreme Court dismembers Obamacare", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/03/17/what-would-happen-to-children-if-the-supreme-court-dismembers-obamacare/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/12/15/National-Politics/Images/205790592-5492.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@strombergsteve"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/03/17/what-would-happen-to-children-if-the-supreme-court-dismembers-obamacare/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "obamacare, affordable care act, aca, supreme court, congress, republicans, obamacare illegal, obamacare subsidies, insurance coverage, children's health insurance, health insurance, uninsured, affordable care act illegal, obamacare case, obamacare ruling, aca case, aca ruling, affordable care act ruling, affordable care act case, republicans obamacare, republicans affordable care act, king v. burwell, chip, schip, medicaid", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/strombergsteve"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "obamacare, affordable care act, aca, supreme court, congress, republicans, obamacare illegal, obamacare subsidies, insurance coverage, children's health insurance, health insurance, uninsured, affordable care act illegal, obamacare case, obamacare ruling, aca case, aca ruling, affordable care act ruling, affordable care act case, republicans obamacare, republicans affordable care act, king v. burwell, chip, schip, medicaid"}, "article_summary": "The bottom line: In a worst-case scenario, a whopping 3.3 million more kids could end up without health coverage.\nOn its own, a Supreme Court ruling hostile to the Obama administration would result in 730,000 more uninsured children, because their parents would lose the ability to claim federal health insurance subsidies.\nBut what would happen to children, a vulnerable group with specific health-care needs that any rational society would address?\nBy September, Congress must renew funding for the key Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, also known as CHIP, otherwise states will have to taper or shut their CHIP programs.\nThe court will rule this year in the context of a larger debate about the federal government\u2019s childhood health programs."}
