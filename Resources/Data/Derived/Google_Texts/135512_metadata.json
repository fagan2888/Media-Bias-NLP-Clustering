He ultimately opted for both.\n\n\u201cI had a particularly unusual experience sitting at my table between [Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)] and Linda Evangelista. I was like, this is the weirdest pairing I\u2019ve ever been sandwiched in between,\u201d the \u201cVeep\u201d star tells ITK.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAt first, the seventh-grade boy inside me was just sort of like checking out Linda Evangelista. And then, as the night wore on, I was like, man, I have the opportunity to corner Nancy Pelosi here. And she was really funny. Like, she and I really got along.\u201d\n\nNot to mention that \u201cVeep\u201d fan Pelosi \u2014 who was recently named one of ITK\u2019s \u201cBest Dressed\u201d on Capitol Hill \u2014 was wearing some head-turning duds, according to Scott.\n\n\u201cShe was just sort of like an upbeat gal. She was very relaxed, very cool. She was a snappy dresser. She had this like really skintight, white lace pantsuit on. I was like, \u2018Damn, girl.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. The whole evening was just kind of surreal,\u201d Scott, 37, says with a laugh.\n\nScott, who plays the deputy director of communications, Dan Egan, to Julia Louis-Dreyfus\u2019s fictional president on the hit HBO show, has a pretty good reason he\u2019s unlikely to make this year\u2019s correspondents festivities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re expecting our little guy very soon,\u201d explains the entertainer, whose wife, Elspeth Keller, is pregnant with the couple\u2019s first child.\n\nThe due date of Scott\u2019s son could potentially coincide with the return of the comedy series, which premieres its fourth season on April 12. This season, Louis-Dreyfus\u2019s character, Selina Meyer, will be the one in power in the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cWith her new status as president, the world almost had to expand, because there are just so many more people swirling through that office,\u201d Scott says. \u201cI know one of the things that people tend to like about it is how dense the show is. It\u2019s gotten even denser, but people somehow still feel included,\u201d he says of the upcoming episodes.\n\nFor those who contend the political satire \u2014 the third season of \u201cVeep\u201d was released on DVD and Blu-ray this week \u2014 may be progressing too quickly with the sometimes-bumbling Meyer\u2019s rise from vice president to POTUS, Scott says there hasn\u2019t been a shortage of material for creator Armando Iannucci. \u201cHe seems to have no problem coming up with a list of endless problems for politicians to have,\u201d Scott says. \u201cI guess as long as [they] keep doing what they\u2019re doing, we\u2019ll still have ways to make fun of it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Reid Scott had a choice to make at the last White House Correspondents\u2019 Association Dinner: go gaga over a supermodel or chat up the House minority leader.
