Philip Seidle, is charged with her murder.\n\n\u201cEven though she is gone, her life still lives on through those nine children,\u201d said Gregory Jones, founder of the domestic-violence awareness organization Walking in Her Shoes, which hosted the march. \u201cWe are here to celebrate her life not her death.\u201d\n\nWilson-Seidle was gunned down June 16 on Sewall Avenue. Witnesses and county officials say Philip Seidle used his service weapon to fire two volleys of gunshots at her as their 7-year-old daughter and police watched. Wilson-Seidle had alleged in a divorce complaint that her ex-husband physically abused her throughout their marriage.\n\nMORE: Eyewitnesses saw woman shot by off-duty cop\n\nAbout 60 people participated in the walk which started and ended at the city\u2019s Library Park. Proceeds from the walk will go to the Seidle children.\n\nOn Saturday, the Asbury Park Press also presented the family with a $500 check that came from an anonymous donor who requested the newspaper donate to the cause of its choice.\n\nKyria Ferguson, a Seidle family friend, said she worked with Jones to pull the event together.\n\n\u201cI think it shows how the community comes together to help the kids moving forward,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cIt gives them strength, and they know they have support out here, they are not alone.\u201d\n\nWilson-Seidle\u2019s oldest daughter, Kirsten Seidle, thanked the community for their support at the march and other donations made to the family.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really been helping us to be able to stay together and grow through this experience,\u201d she said.\n\nMORE: Asbury-Neptune NAACP honors \u201can angel\u201d in Wilson-Seidle\n\nCharles Harris of Lakewood said his grandson played Neptune sports with some of the Seidle children. He recalled sitting at football games and wrestling matches with Tamara and Philip.\n\n\u201cWe are all here to lend some kind of support to the family,\u201d Harris said. \u201cPractical, prayer, emotional support ... we are just part of a community that\u2019s pulling together to help the family.\u201d\n\nFriends and community members spoke during the open-mic session at the event.\n\n\u201cTami was a tough cookie; she was a strong woman,\u201d said the Rev. Miguel Virella, pastor of Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church, where Tamara Wilson-Seidle was a religious educator. \u201cShe was a great mother and a good friend.\u201d\n\nJones conducted a roll call of people across the country who have been killed in domestic violence incidents. In many of the cases, the women were killed by their partners with their children watching or in the same house.\n\nJones said Walking in her Shoes hosts walks and events nationwide to honor victims and share information about domestic violence.\n\n\u201cIf we can save one person we have done our job,\u201d Jones said. \u201cOur slogan is \u2018No one has the right to love you to death.\u2019 \u201d\n\nNicquel Terry: 732-643-4023; nterry@gannettnj.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1F74bwk", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Dozens honor Tamara Wilson-Seidle at event that looked to raise awareness of domestic violence.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Dozens honor Tamara Wilson-Seidle at event that looked to raise awareness of domestic violence.", "title": "Community marches for slain mother of nine", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/local/eatontown-asbury-park/asbury-park/2015/08/29/seidle-walk/71384734/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dozens honor Tamara Wilson-Seidle at event that looked to raise awareness of domestic violence.", "title": "Community marches for slain mom", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/be8a15f46563c4aa2049d7c9711e3bf046ad1fc2/c=0-0-1561-1561&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/29/NJGroup/AsburyPark/635764663598846432-walk082915g.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/nicquel.terry"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Tamara Wilson-Seidle, Asbury Park, walk, Philip Seidle"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd98b8\"", "article_summary": "MORE: Asbury-Neptune NAACP honors \u201can angel\u201d in Wilson-SeidleCharles Harris of Lakewood said his grandson played Neptune sports with some of the Seidle children.\nMiguel Virella, pastor of Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church, where Tamara Wilson-Seidle was a religious educator.\nKyria Ferguson, a Seidle family friend, said she worked with Jones to pull the event together.\nThis event was held in honor of Tamara Wilson-Seidle.\nProceeds from the walk will go to the Seidle children."}
