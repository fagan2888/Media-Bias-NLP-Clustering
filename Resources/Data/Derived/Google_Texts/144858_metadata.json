Brookfield will continue to manage and lease the property, built in 1984. The deal values the property at $480 million, and Brookfield said its net proceeds from the transaction are $98 million.\n\nRepublic Plaza, which has 1.2 million square feet of office space, is 95.2 percent leased, with its two largest tenants, Encana Corp. and DCP Midstream, occupying just under half the office tower on long-term leases.\n\n\u201cRepublic Plaza is a trophy office tower in a core real estate market,\u201d Robert Merck, global head of real estate for MetLife, said in a statement. \u201cBrookfield is an experienced and successful owner and operator of office properties, and we are looking forward to expanding our partnership with them.\u201d\n\nMetLife, based in Manhattan, is one of the world\u2019s largest providers of insurance, annuities and employee benefit services. Brookfield Office, also based in New York, has a portfolio of 113 properties across the globe, including 1801 California, where it recently completed a $50 million renovation.\n\nBack in 2006, Brookfield purchased two buildings right next to Republic Plaza, including one that housed Duffy\u2019s Shamrock Bar, a popular eatery. Brookfield at the time said it planned to build a 1,000-car parking garage, but hasn\u2019t done so.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Brookfield and MetLife to share ownership of Denver\u2019s Republic Plaza", "title": "Brookfield and MetLife to share ownership of Denver\u2019s Republic Plaza", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/05/16/brookfield-and-metlife-to-share-ownership-of-denvers-republic-plaza/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140516__20140517_A17_BZ17REPUBLICp1.jpg", "height": 422}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140516__20140517_A17_BZ17REPUBLICp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-16T13:08:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T18:30:34+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Brookfield Office Properties said this week that it has entered into a 50-50 joint venture with MetLife to share ownership of the 56-story building.\nRepublic Plaza, Denver\u2019s tallest skyscraper, has a new co-owner.\nBack in 2006, Brookfield purchased two buildings right next to Republic Plaza, including one that housed Duffy\u2019s Shamrock Bar, a popular eatery.\n\u201cRepublic Plaza is a trophy office tower in a core real estate market,\u201d Robert Merck, global head of real estate for MetLife, said in a statement.\nThe deal values the property at $480 million, and Brookfield said its net proceeds from the transaction are $98 million."}
