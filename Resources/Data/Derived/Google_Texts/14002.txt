President Barack Obama was on ESPN Radio Friday pushing Monday’s sign-up deadline for Obamacare.

While discussing some of the history of athletes who’ve spoken out on political issues, the president said, “Listen, I spend most of my time watching ESPN in the morning. I get so much politics I don’t, you know, want to be inundated with a bunch of chatter about politics during the day.”

LISTEN:

In the past, the president has said he found out about the IRS targeting conservatives for the political beliefs, the VA scandal, Fast and Furious from media reports.

WATCH:

Considering he has a staff of thousands who are supposed to inform him of what is happening within his own government and they clearly aren’t, it might be time for him to switch the TV from SportsCenter to actual news. After all, being president of the United States is the job he ran for twice. Entering his 6th in that job is as good a time as any to start doing it.
