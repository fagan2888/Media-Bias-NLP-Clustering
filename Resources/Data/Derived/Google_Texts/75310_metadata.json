Self employed would pay the whole tax while workers for businesses would pay about a third with the employer kicking in the rest.\n\nProponents say the single-payer system would save administrative costs, be a wash with money that residents already spend on health insurance, cover everyone who has lived in the state for a year or more and cut out profits for large health insurance companies.\n\n\u201cI think most people would love to have health insurance, but they can\u2019t afford it,\u201d said state Sen. Irene Aguilar, a Denver Democrat and physician who is helping organize support for the ballot issue. \u201cBy spreading the costs based on ability to pay, we could make sure everyone gets the care they need.\u201d\n\nBut Linda Gorman, who studies health care for the free-market Independence Institute, called it a \u201cvery, very bad idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people supporting it are ill-informed,\u201d she said. \u201cThey would benefit from some serious reading in the economics of public choice, and from (studying) how the kind of thing they are proposing actually operates when run by real people in the real world.\u201d\n\nGorman said the premium tax increase would give Colorado the highest state income tax rate in the country and allow unlimited tax increases as the measure says it is not subject to Taxpayer Bill of Rights restrictions on raising revenue.\n\nShe also notes the initiative doesn\u2019t define residency requirements so people could claim benefits by registering at homeless shelters or other non-permanent locations. And a board of trustees would decide what procedures are covered so people might still have to pay to get certain treatment.\n\nIN OTHER NEWS: Vermont removes critic of single payer system\n\n\u201cIt would be hard to think of a worse choice for a high-income, industrialized economy except, perhaps, the Soviet or North Korean models,\u201d she said.\n\nAguilar said people would have to establish one year of residency to receive benefits and all people who establish residency and pay into the system would get a chance to vote on any premium increases. She said Colorado residents would be covered for the essentials established under the Affordable Care Act as well as preventive care.\n\nThe secretary of state certified last month the group had enough signatures to get on the November ballot, but recent proposals for large tax increases in Colorado have failed even for popular issues like education.\n\nColorado voters easily rejected a nearly $1 billion tax increase for school funding in 2013, and even Denver voters, known to support many tax hikes, killed a proposal last month to fund college tuition through a sales tax increase.\n\nPolitically, Aguilar concedes single-payer is not a popular term in the United States and the health insurance companies will likely outspend them to urge voters to reject the issue. A spokeswoman for the health insurance association didn\u2019t return a call seeking comment.\n\nColoradoCaresYes campaign will be funded mostly with small, grassroots contributions, she said.\n\nBut Aguilar said it will be popular in rural places that have high insurance premiums.\n\n\u201cThis is an issue that makes sense for everybody spending a lot of money that benefits a corporation that might not be that interested in their personal well-being,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "A group wants Colorado to provide universal healthcare to state residents but critics say it will result in a huge tax increase.", "title": "Colorado ballot question proposes single-payer health coverage, huge tax increase - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/11/hc-imageflickr.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-07T21:38:13+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/249383/colorado-ballot-question-proposes-single-payer-health-coverage-huge-tax-increase/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Colorado", "tag": "coloradocares,Independence Institute,Initiative,single payer healthcare", "published_time": "2015-12-09T04:00:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-07T21:38:13+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "A group wants Colorado to provide universal healthcare to state residents but critics say it will result in a huge tax increase.", "title": "Colorado ballot question proposes single-payer health coverage, huge tax increase - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/11/hc-imageflickr.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "A group wants Colorado to provide universal healthcare to state residents but critics say it will result in a huge tax increase."}, "article_summary": "A spokeswoman for the health insurance association didn\u2019t return a call seeking comment.\nColorado voters easily rejected a nearly $1 billion tax increase for school funding in 2013, and even Denver voters, known to support many tax hikes, killed a proposal last month to fund college tuition through a sales tax increase.\nSelf employed would pay the whole tax while workers for businesses would pay about a third with the employer kicking in the rest.\nVoters will get to decide whether to approve a new state entity with its own board of trustees that would pay for health care for Colorado residents funded by a 10 percent payroll tax.\nPolitically, Aguilar concedes single-payer is not a popular term in the United States and the health insurance companies will likely outspend them to urge voters to reject the issue."}
