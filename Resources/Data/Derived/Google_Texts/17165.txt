Right Hooks Fun With Federalism

Democrats don’t often like federalism, and, when they do, you have to wonder what they’re smoking. Speaking of that habit, Barack Obama weighed in on the controversy over legalized pot, saying, hey, it’s a states' rights issue, man. “[W]hat you’re seeing now is Colorado [and] Washington – through state referendum – they’re experimenting with legal marijuana,” he said. “The position of my administration has been: We still have federal laws that classify marijuana as an illegal substance, but we’re not going to spend a lot of resources trying to turn back decisions that have been made at the state level on this issue.” That’s funny – when he’s not forcing states to do his bidding via ObamaCare he’s lobbying the courts to overturn their marriage laws or suing them over voter ID laws and immigration enforcement. Talk about making a hash out of policy.
