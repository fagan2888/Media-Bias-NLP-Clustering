I just try to keep thinking about me and the court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018They did support me but I think they\u2019d been drinking a bit.\n\n\u2018\u2018That\u2019s life. You just have to get used to it.\u2019\u2019\n\nTomic idolises Bernard and described her painful experience watching his first-round withdrawal against world No.1 Rafael Nadal with a groin tear, after which the Australian was booed by spectators at Rod Laver Arena.\n\n\u2018\u2018I was really worried at the time. I was at the point where I was going to cry,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018\u2018Hopefully everything gets better and he stays healthy.\u2019\u2019\n\nTomic vowed to regroup for her junior doubles campaign with Buayam, saying she was confident they could challenge for the title.\n\n\u2018\u2018I\u2019ve always wanted to play with her, but she\u2019s always had a partner,\u2019\u2019 the teenager said.\n\n\u2018\u2018But we\u2019re pretty good together.\u2019\u2019\n\nTomic said familiarity might have been a factor in losing her singles match to her good friend.\n\n\u2018\u2018We know each other\u2019s games well. Always against me, she always plays well,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018\u2018She\u2019s one of my closest friends in tennis. When we go on court, we\u2019re not friends.\n\n\u2018\u2018But she came over afterwards, gave me a hug.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhile Tomic crashed out, fellow Australians Bradley Mousley, Harry Bourchier, Lizette Cabrera and Destanee Aiava won through to the second round of the juniors.\n\nAAP", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Tennis", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Sara Tomic fell victim to &lsquo;&lsquo;unfair&rsquo;&rsquo; taunts about her older brother Bernard en route to a first-round exit from the Australian Open junior girls&rsquo; singles.", "title": "Sara Tomic heckled at Australian Open", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/sport/tennis/sara-tomic-heckled-at-australian-open-20140118-311jb.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/1/1/j/g/image.related.thumbnail.320x214.311jb.png/1390028488000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@smh", "image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/1/1/j/g/image.related.thumbnail.320x214.311jb.png/1390028488000.jpg"}, "description": "Sara Tomic fell victim to \u2018\u2018unfair\u2019\u2019 taunts about her older brother Bernard en route to a first-round exit from the Australian Open junior girls\u2019 singles.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Sara Tomic heckled at Australian Open"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "Sara Tomic fell victim to \u2018\u2018unfair\u2019\u2019 taunts about her older brother Bernard en route to a first-round exit from the Australian Open ..."}, "article_summary": "Photo: Getty ImagesSara Tomic fell victim to \u2018\u2018unfair\u2019\u2019 taunts about her older brother Bernard en route to a first-round exit from the Australian Open junior girls\u2019 singles on Saturday.\nTomic, 15, lost 7-5 6-2 to her Thai doubles partner Kamonwan Buayam before admitting the heckling on court 20 was an unwanted distraction.\n\u2018\u2018Hopefully everything gets better and he stays healthy.\u2019\u2019Tomic vowed to regroup for her junior doubles campaign with Buayam, saying she was confident they could challenge for the title.\nAustralia's youngster Sara Tomic.\n\u2018\u2018But we\u2019re pretty good together.\u2019\u2019Tomic said familiarity might have been a factor in losing her singles match to her good friend."}
