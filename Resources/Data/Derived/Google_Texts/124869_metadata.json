The Saints Peter and Paul Greek Orthodox Church of Boulder held its 10th annual Taste of Orthodoxy festival this weekend. ( CLIFF GRASSMICK )\n\n\n\nAn estimated 3,000 people attended over the weekend.\n\n\n\nParticipants described it as a three-day block party \u2014 one where people could buy kalamata olives and sheep's milk feta along with religious pictures and books in the bookstore tent. They could also learn more about orthodox Christianity and iconography and listen to a Byzantine choir.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's wonderful,\u201d said Firestone's Bill Rippy.\n\n\n\nProceeds from food and beverage sales go to support the church and a different local charity each year. This year, the festival is supporting Lafayette's Sister Carmen Community Center.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe plan this all year long,\u201d said church member Rola DeGeorge.

The menu includes lamb, gyros, saganaki (flaming cheese), dolmathes (stuffed grapevine leaves), kourabiethes (butter cookies), ouzo cake and loukoumades (donut holes, Greek style).\n\n\n\nSamira Serougi is known for the light and flavorful falafel that she mixes, rolls and fries all three days of the festival. The middle eastern recipe, which includes lots of garlic and parsley, is one that has been passed down in her family for generations, she said.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's an old recipe,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's special.\u201d\n\n\n\nJim Zissimos, who has been a member of the church for 25 years, joked while dishing up loukoumades that the festival draws a crowd because \u201ceverybody wants to be Greek.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople can learn about all the cultures and taste the different foods,\u201d he said. \u201cWe've got everything here.\u201d\n\n\n\nDancing and music is another draw. Both outside groups and the church's own dance group, the Dancing Zorbas, perform. Live music is provided by Jesse Manno and Friends. The band members said they've watched the festival meld into an extended community for people from different Mediterranean ethnicities. Plus, they said, it's a fun, energy filled event to play.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe get inspired to learn new things to play,\u201d said singer Julia Lancaster.\n\n\n\nClick on any photo to see full gallery Folk dancing, live music, authentic food and enthusiastic calls of \u201copa\u201d made for a lively festival today outside the Saints Peter and Paul Greek Orthodox Church near Boulder.The three-day, 10th annual Taste of Orthodoxy celebration of Greek faith, culture and history wrapped up today.
