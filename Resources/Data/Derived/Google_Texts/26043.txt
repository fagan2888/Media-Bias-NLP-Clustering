Osage Nation member Evie Kenworthy, 21, her boyfriend Robert Moseley, 26, and their three young children have been reported missing since February 27.

After receiving their $10,000 tax rebate, the Hominy, Oklahoma-based couple told their families they were headed to Tulsa for a brief getaway and to work on their relationship, according to Fox News. The pair recently reconciled their seven-year relationship following a three-month separation. It was intended to be a one-day or potentially weekend trip, with kids in tow, according to Evie's mom Debbie Kenworthy.

"When [Evie] left, she hugged me and said, 'I love you and I’ll see you tomorrow,'" Debbie Kenworthy told The Huffington Post on Friday.

Evie did not pack any clothes for herself or their children, ages 1, 2 and 4, but according to Debbie, Evie's boyfriend "took all of his clothes."

"He took everything except his cell phone, which I find unusual," she told The Huffington Post.

Evie has not responded to her mother's calls or texts. Hominy and Osage County police have tried contacting the family's cell phones, but they appear to be turned off, reported TulsaWorld.com.

The family of five was last seen in a gray, late-model Ford Escape with an Osage Nation license plate.

"This is highly unusual. My daughter is the type of person who is always in contact with her family, but there’s been nothing," said Debbie, comparing the worrisome disappearance to an "alien abduction."

Anyone who may have seen the family or may have knowledge of the family's whereabouts is asked to call Hominy police at 918-885-4545, the Osage County Sheriff's Office at 918-287-3535, or a local law-enforcement agency.
