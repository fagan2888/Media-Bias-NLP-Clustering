The median age of infected patients was 72.\n\nLead author Joshua Thaden, M.D., a fellow in Duke's Division of Infectious Diseases, suggested it may be time to actively screen patients for antibiotic-resistant E. coli. Patients may not exhibit symptoms even if their skin is colonized with the bacteria, he said in the announcement.\n\nThe findings are published online in Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology, and come amid fears of a looming global crisis of antibiotic-resistant superbugs brought on by overuse and misuse of antibiotics. The only sustainable solution is to rein in antibiotic use, said the co-author of the report, \"The State of the World's Antibiotics, 2015.\" Improving water, sanitation and immunization will reduce the need for antibiotics, according to the report, as will better hospital infection control and implementation of antibiotic stewardship programs.\n\nSome hospitals are experimenting with using naturally germ-resistant copper surfaces to reduce the risk of spreading dangerous microbes, FierceHealthcare previously reported. High-touch, easily contaminated areas being replaced with copper include faucet and cabinet handles, IV poles and nurse call buttons.\n\nFor more:\n\n- see the study abstract\n\n- read the announcement\n\n- download the antibiotic report (.pdf)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nAntibiotic resistance: Global report reveals alarming rates of bacteria resistant to last-resort drugs\n\nIn the age of Ebola and superbugs, interest grows in copper as infection prevention\n\nMajority of hospitals rate poorly in controlling C.diff, MRSA\n\nAntibiotic-resistant superbugs: 'Health crisis of this generation'\n\nWhite House plan calls for aggressive measures against superbugs", "article_metadata": {"description": "The rate of drug-resistant E. coli infections seen in community hospitals doubled between 2009 and 2014, with the majority of the infections occurring in healthcare settings, a\u00a0study\u00a0by Duke Medicine found.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "The rate of drug-resistant E. coli infections seen in community hospitals doubled between 2009 and 2014, with the majority of the infections occurring in healthcare settings, a\u00a0study\u00a0by Duke Medicine found.", "title": "Drug-resistant E. coli infection rates in community hospitals double", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/drug-resistant-e-coli-infection-rates-community-hospitals-double/2015-10-14", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Antibiotic resistance,community hospitals,E. coli,Patient Care & Outcomes", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5840\"", "article_summary": "The findings are important because more than half of U.S. patients receive their healthcare from community hospitals, according to a Duke University announcement.\nThe rate of drug-resistant E. coli infections seen in community hospitals doubled between 2009 and 2014, with the majority of the infections occurring in healthcare settings, a study by Duke Medicine found.\nBut researchers also found that infection rate among patients with limited exposure to healthcare facilities more than tripled, suggesting further study is needed into community-acquired infections.\nThe findings are published online in Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology, and come amid fears of a looming global crisis of antibiotic-resistant superbugs brought on by overuse and misuse of antibiotics.\nSome hospitals are experimenting with using naturally germ-resistant copper surfaces to reduce the risk of spreading dangerous microbes, FierceHealthcare previously reported."}
