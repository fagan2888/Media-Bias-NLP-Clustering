Nina Dobrev is getting naked — for a good cause.

The Vampire Diaries star stripped down this week in an attempt to draw attention to Obamacare. Dobrev posed topless with a sign that read “#getcovered” covering her chest.

The hashtag is part of an effort to get millions of Americans without health insurance to sign up for the new options to them under health insurance exchanges.

Dobrev felt compelled to get into the fight over Obamacare despite the fact that she’s not even American.

“Im Canadian. We have healthcare for all. If you dont have insurance go tohttp://say.ly/cdi6TN2 and #GetCovered, Because w/o it, youre naked,” she wrote.

Nina Dobrev wasn’t the only celebrity to support Obamacare this week, though not all of them appeared naked. Others using the hashtage #getcovered included Kerry Washington, Sophia Bush, Shaun White, and Kate Bosworth.

The future of Obamacare, officially known as the Affordable Care Act, is in jeopardy given strong opposition from Republicans in Congress. A small but devoted group of Tea Party Republicans have vowed not to vote on an essential funding measure unless an amendment to defund or delay Obamacare was included.

Democrats have refused to scrap Pres. Obama’s signature legislation, leading to a government shutdown.

Nina Dobrev has been in the news lately, but not exactly for her political activism. The 24-year-old actress recently started dating former Dancing with the Stars pro Derek Hough,

“[Nina] was hanging a lot with Derek’s sister Julianne,” a source told Us Weekly. “Then she fell for him.”

Dobrev is coming off a three-year relationship with fellow Vampire Diaries star Ian Somerhalder.

She appears to be over the relationship now. Last week Nina Dobrev posted a picture with Derek to her WhoSay account, along with the caption: “Those of us touched by your light got to watch you brighten up the rest of the world. Keep shining!”
