WMC Action News 5 reached out to Kellogg officials who are investigating the incident.

According to Kellogg's spokesperson Kris Charles, the video was recorded at the Memphis, Tennessee, facility in 2014.

Charles also released the following statement on behalf of Kellogg:

“Kellogg takes this situation very seriously and we were shocked and deeply disappointed by this video that we just learned of today. We immediately alerted law enforcement authorities and regulators. A criminal investigation is underway as well as a thorough internal investigation. Our investigation revealed that the video was recorded at our Memphis, TN facility, in 2014. We have confirmed that products that could have been potentially affected were Rice Krispies Treats, Rice Krispies Treats cereal and puffed rice cake products, all of which would be past expiration date. Food quality is of the utmost importance to Kellogg Company. We are outraged by this completely unacceptable situation, and we will work closely with authorities to prosecute to the full extent of the law.”

Memphis residents are disgusted after learning about the video.

"We could be dealing with people’s health, people getting sick and dealing with children,” Tony Pacasso said.

"For a person to do something like that, he is nasty, low down, dirty,” Felicia Hayslett said. “He should go to jail. Go straight to jail."
