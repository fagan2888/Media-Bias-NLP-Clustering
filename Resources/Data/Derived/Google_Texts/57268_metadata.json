The Israelis have lost at least 32 soldiers and three civilians. Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, who has been trying in vain to mediate, said that this round of war has been worse than the Israelis\u2019 previous biggest effort to knock out Hamas, in 2008-09, because Palestinian civilians this time have \u201cno way out\u201d. Gazan schools run by the UN\u2019s refugee agency, where at least 140,000 Palestinians have sought shelter, have been hit.\n\nThe Israelis say it is inevitable that civilians will be hurt, because Hamas uses them as human shields, by putting rocket-launchers and other military facilities in areas and buildings crammed with civilians. The United States and the European Union have defended Israel\u2019s \u201cright to self-defence\u201d in the face of Hamas\u2019s rockets. But a growing chorus of international human-rights organisations are accusing Israel of committing war crimes.\n\nSince Israel intensified its assault by sending in troops on the ground on July 17th, its forces have pushed deep into the densely populated strip, where 1.8m people are stuck within a coastal enclave 41km (25 miles) long and 6-10km wide. The Israelis say their troops, having cleared a buffer zone on the strip\u2019s eastern side, now control nearly half the territory. Many residential areas have been struck, particularly the Shujaiya suburb of Gaza City. In one Israeli attack, a family of 25 was wiped out. Bodies lay strewn across streets reduced to rubble. Several hospitals have been hit.\n\nIsraelis, in rather different ways, also feel isolated. Hamas\u2019s rockets, whose range and sophistication have increased in recent years, have sent Israelis rushing to shelters. One missile on July 22nd landed within two kilometres of Tel Aviv\u2019s Ben Gurion airport, the gateway for 90% of Israelis who travel abroad. An array of international airlines then suspended flights to Israel; some incoming aircraft turned around. Business and tourism have plummeted. Funerals of dead Israelis in the largest toll in war since Israel\u2019s campaign in Lebanon in 2006 have cast the country into mourning. The mood is of anger and trepidation rather than triumph.\n\nIsraeli generals say they can yet beat Hamas into submission. Indeed, the rate of rocket fire has begun to fall, as Gaza\u2019s fighters husband their remaining stockpile. The Israelis say they have uncovered at least 23 tunnels into Israel, through which Hamas intended to send guerrillas on missions to capture Israelis and hold them as hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners; in this way 1,000-plus of them were swapped for Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier nabbed in 2006 and held by Hamas for five years. The tunnels are being blown up, the stockpiles methodically destroyed. Israeli generals say they need time to finish the job.\n\nSome Israelis, however, are sceptical. \u201cTo neutralise Hamas militarily, Israel would have to go into and under every house in Gaza,\u201d says Martin van Creveld, a leading Israeli military historian. \u201cAnd even then, it wouldn\u2019t work.\u201d Since previous wars in Gaza, Hamas fighters have improved in both offensive and defensive terms. On occasions they have seized the initiative, for instance by launching amphibious landings on the Israeli coast. They have popped up to attack from their warren of tunnels. This week they managed to capture another Israeli soldier, though it is unclear whether he has survived. \u201cBetter that he\u2019s dead,\u201d muttered a retired officer, fearful that Israel will eventually have to negotiate another one-sided prisoner exchange.\n\nSome analysts say Hamas\u2019s capability has begun to approach that of Hizbullah, the Shia militia in Lebanon, which killed more than 130 Israeli soldiers and 30 civilians in a month-long war there in 2006. \u201cChutzpah used to be Israel\u2019s military trademark,\u201d says a Palestinian musician, admiring his compatriots\u2019 latest military performance. \u201cNow it\u2019s Hamas\u2019s.\u201d\n\nEven if Hamas could be smashed, says Mr Van Creveld, the Islamist movement might splinter into a web of factions, some claiming allegiance to the region\u2019s jihadist groups, each competing to be more extreme than the other. In the Palestinian diaspora, including refugee camps in the region, jihadist sentiment is growing, making Hamas look mild in comparison. Israel could end up being no safer than before.\n\nSome prominent Israelis from the military and intelligence world think Israel should offer an olive branch as well as its iron fist. Yuval Diskin, a former head of the Shabak, Israel\u2019s internal security service, has written that a military takeover of Gaza would \u201cnot generate real winners\u201d; a diplomatic push should accompany the military one. The warring parties should agree to a long-term ceasefire in exchange for \u201cfully lifting the economic, land and naval blockade\u201d of Gaza, including the opening of its borders, airport and seaport, to be overseen by international monitors.\n\nThe Economic Co-operation Foundation, an Israeli think-tank, has penned a similar plan. It calls for Gaza to be rebuilt under a government headed by Mahmoud Abbas, head of the Palestinians\u2019 moderate mainstream authority, who is based in the West Bank, the larger bit of a would-be Palestinian state. This should be followed by a resumption of serious Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.\n\nThere are signs that some senior Israeli ministers, mindful of such advice, may be changing their minds. Moshe Yaalon, the defence minister, has spoken in favour of Mr Abbas returning to stabilise Gaza at the head of the reconciliation government, similar to the one denounced by the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, when it was formed with Hamas\u2019s endorsement after the failure of Israeli-Palestinian talks in April. Some Israeli officials now say they never really opposed the Palestinian unity government. That is a sign, says a former senior Israeli official, that Israeli ministers may be considering a volte face, dropping their previous policy of sowing division between the Palestinian leaderships of Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nSome Hamas cadres are also, unusually, speaking in favour of Mr Abbas resuming authority in Gaza. Many were buoyed by his decision, after he vacillated during the first days of the latest war, to endorse Hamas\u2019s insistence that the blockade of Gaza should be lifted and that prisoners should be released as part of a ceasefire accord. He also seemed to abandon shuttle diplomacy in the region, whose Arab leaders have mostly been notably loth to speak up for Hamas. \u201cFinally he realised that angry Saudis are less important than angry Palestinians,\u201d says a Hamas official in Gaza, surmising that Mr Abbas now has a better chance of rallying a solid majority of Palestinians in both territories behind him.\n\nBut even if Israel\u2019s leaders begin to see the merit of negotiating with the Palestinians, it is hard to see how they could persuade Israeli voters that the latest war was worth the lifting of the siege of Gaza and the freeing of Hamas prisoners. Besides, Egypt\u2019s new regime and Hamas are virulently at odds. Qatar and Turkey, whose governments are close to Hamas, are distrusted by Israel. The European Union (EU) still refuses to talk to Hamas. It is an uphill struggle to find effective mediators.\n\nEgypt has to be involved if Gaza\u2019s border at Rafah is to be opened. An international monitoring mechanism would have to be set up, perhaps overseen by an American-led \u201ccontact group\u201d including Egypt and the EU. Whatever the outcome of the present war, it seems certain that America, despite its recent failure to make peace, will be dragged back into the diplomatic fray. Its secretary of state, John Kerry, is shuttling around the region\u2014but so far in vain.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/50_by_50/images/print-edition/20140726_MAP001_0.jpg", "sailthru.flytitle": "The war in Gaza", "description": "As the death toll soars, both sides claim success, while mediators flounder", "pubdate": 20140726, "og": {"site_name": "The Economist", "description": "As the death toll soars, both sides claim success, while mediators flounder", "title": "No one is winning\u2014yet", "url": "http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21608760-death-toll-soars-both-sides-claim-success-while-mediators-flounder-no-one", "image": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20140726_MAP001_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.rubric": "As the death toll soars, both sides claim success, while mediators flounder", "sailthru.date": "2014-07-24 11:35:15", "sailthru.printdate": "2014-07-26 00:00:00", "revisit-after": "1 day", "sailthru.tags": "The war in Gaza", "fb": {"pages": 6013004059, "app_id": 173277756049645}, "sailthru.imagepath": "images/print-edition/20140726_MAP001_0.jpg", "articleid": 21608760, "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20140726_MAP001_0.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb_mfte": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/ec_related_article_image/images/print-edition/20140726_MAP001_0.jpg", "sailthru.web_section": "Middle East and Africa", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theeconomist"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20140726_MAP001_0.jpg", "site": "@TheEconomist", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "news_keywords": "The war in Gaza"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce016\"", "article_summary": "The Israelis say their troops, having cleared a buffer zone on the strip\u2019s eastern side, now control nearly half the territory.\n\u201cAnd even then, it wouldn\u2019t work.\u201d Since previous wars in Gaza, Hamas fighters have improved in both offensive and defensive terms.\n\u201cTo neutralise Hamas militarily, Israel would have to go into and under every house in Gaza,\u201d says Martin van Creveld, a leading Israeli military historian.\nBut a growing chorus of international human-rights organisations are accusing Israel of committing war crimes.\nSome prominent Israelis from the military and intelligence world think Israel should offer an olive branch as well as its iron fist."}
