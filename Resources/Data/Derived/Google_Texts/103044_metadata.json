And Sen. Ted Cruz swerved clear of a deep one this afternoon.\n\nAt a speech to conservative activists at the Heritage Foundation, a member of the audience asked Cruz whether the Obama administration \u2013 by \u201creleasing U.S. enemies from Gitmo and trying to put Gen. Petraeus in jail\u201d \u2013 has justified the question \u201cwhich side we\u2019re on.\u201d\n\nDavid Petraeus, the former CIA director, is under investigation for leaking classified information to a mistress.\n\nCruz thought for a split second.\n\n\u201cThis administration has a very difficult time differentiating good guys from bad guys,\u201d he said, pivoting quickly to a set of allegations he\u2019s more comfortable discussing \u2013 towit, that the Obama administration is too cozy with enemies such as Iran and too antagonistic with allies such as Israel.\n\nOver the course of about an hour, the freshman senator ran through his critique of congressional Republicans who, in his view, are far too timid in standing up to the president and far too willing to abandon campaign pledges to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nObamacare, he asserted, has wrought \u201cdevastation.\u201d He called it a \u201ctrain wreck\u201d that has cost millions of Americans their jobs or access to doctors of their choice, and forced employers to roll back working hours.\n\nDemocrats were watching the speech, and were not amused.\n\nThe party\u2019s press office noted that the rate of uninsured is near its all-time low. Health care costs are growing more slowing than ever. \u201cUp to 129 million Americans with pre-existing conditions no longer have to worry about being denied health coverage\u201d and the rate of young adults 19-25 without insurance has dropped from 30 percent to 21 percent since the ACA\u2019s enactment in 2010.\n\n\u201cNice try Senator Cruz, but unlike this new Republican Congress, the Affordable Care Act is helping people across the country \u2014 and it\u2019s here to stay regardless of how many times Republicans try to dismantle it,\u201d Democrats said.\n\nCruz, in his Heritage speech, ran through a 10-point policy agenda that includes shutting down the IRS. He would \u201cpadlock the building\u201d and send all of the tax agency\u2019s 110,000 employees to the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\u201cI say that somewhat tongue In cheek,\u201d he said. But \u201cif you swam across the Rio Grande and the first thing you saw was 110,000 IRS agents, you\u2019d turn around and go home.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wMS9jcnV6LWF2b2lkcy1wYWludGluZy1vYmFtYS1hcy10aGUtZW5lbXktYnV0Lmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Todd J.
