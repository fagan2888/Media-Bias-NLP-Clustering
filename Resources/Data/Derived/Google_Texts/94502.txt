sioux falls, sd

If you plan to travel on Sunday, you’ll want to check the forecast before you hit the road.

Snow overnight and falling temperatures could create dangerous travel conditions.

Snowfall totals greater than five inches in combination with high winds will cause visibilities to drop and cause drifting snow. The last of the snowflakes will fall into early Sunday afternoon but snow and clouds will be decreasing as an area of high pressure sets in over KELOLAND.

As of 11:30 a.m., Safe Travel USA shows roads in western and southeastern KELOLAND are slippery due to snow and ice.
