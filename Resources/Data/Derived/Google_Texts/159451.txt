A struggle between officer and suspect spilled over into the Colorado Springs Airport's baggage claim area, where police say travelers were able to help the officer detain the suspect.

The officer, who works at the airport, was investigating a disturbance in the men's bathroom at the airport Friday afternoon when the suspect allegedly assaulted him. Police say the suspect, identified as 50-year-old Pedro Perez, had been making racial slurs towards a black man in the bathroom when the officer interceded.

The officer said he managed to spray Perez with pepper spray during the assault, but that neither the pepper spray or his later use of a stun gun stopped the suspect. The officer finally got the suspect under control in the baggage claim area with the help of others at the airport.

Perez faces charges of boas motivated crimes and second-degree assault on a peace officer.
