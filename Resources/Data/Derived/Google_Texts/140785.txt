HARRISBURG, Pa., Sept. 18 (UPI) -- Eric Matthew Frein, the man who allegedly ambushed two Pennsylvania state troopers Friday, was deemed a federal fugitive Thursday by authorities.

Investigators say Frein has an intense hate of law enforcement. These feelings were turned into a lethal sentiment after Frein participated in European-themed military reenactments. The 31-year-old shaved his head into a mohawk before lying in wait and attacking the officers.

"In the event you are listening to this broadcast on a radio -- on a portable radio -- while cowering in some cool, damp hiding place, I want you to know one thing: Eric, we are coming for you," said Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens.

Troopers in full body armor have been searching for Frein for six days. Two high-powered rifles were missing from Frein's father's home. Police are considering him extremely dangerous.
