Scott Walker, desperate to revive his sinking presidential campaign, unveiled a plan Monday that would essentially wipe out eight decades of industrial labor relations law, dismantle major public employees\u2019 unions and end a requirement that public works projects pay the prevailing wage to construction workers.\n\nIn a speech prepared for delivery later today at Eureka College in Illinois, the alma mater of President Ronald Reagan, Walker will attempt to reboot his campaign with a hard hitting and highly controversial critique of the labor movement and the need for a major overhaul that would strip public employees\u2019 unions of most of their collective bargaining strength.\n\nRelated: Five Obstacles to Scott Walker\u2019s Presidential Bid\n\nThose efforts would include dismantling the National Labor Relations Board that was created during the New Deal in 1934, and passage of a national \u201cright to work\u201d law among federal workers.\n\nHe would also repeal the Davis-Bacon and Project Labor Agreements law that requires federally funded public works projects to pay construction workers the prevailing hourly wage and fringe benefits in their respective jurisdictions, as determined by the Department of Labor. The law applies to contractors and subcontractors performing on federally funded or assisted contracts valued at more than $2,000. Critics like Walker say it unnecessarily increases the government\u2019s costs.\n\n\"Any economic plan that does not bring our federal labor laws into the 21st Century is incomplete,\u201d Walker says in excerpts of his speech released by his campaign. \"Just like President Reagan, I believe we need to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.,\u201d he added.\n\nFrom a strategic political standpoint, Walker is certain to find considerable public sympathy for his views. A 2014 Gallup survey of Americans\u2019 attitudes about the labor movement showed that only 53 percent still approve of unions and their goals. The vast majority indicated that it favors \u201cright to work\u201d laws that have greatly accelerated the decline of private-sector union organizations.\n\nRelated: 11 Facts You Didn\u2019t Know About Scott Walker\n\nAt one time labor unions wielded substantial political and economic clout, but their influence and support is now greatly diminished in the private sector \u2013 while growing rapidly in the government sector. Indeed, AFSCME (the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees), the American Federation of Government Employees, and the American Federation of Teachers boast a membership rate of 35.3 percent, according to Department of Labor statistics. That is five times greater than the 6.7 percent union rate within the private sector job market.\n\n\"In 2012, taxpayers subsidized 3,395,187 hours of 'official time' time spent working for the union or lobbying,\u201d he said. \u201cThat cost the taxpayers $156 million.\u201d\n\nAs for the NLRB, Walker claimed that it had become \u201ca one-sided proxy for big union bosses \u2013 often at the expense of taxpayers and workers. The NLRB is an independent government agency responsible for conducting elections to determine labor union representation and for investigating and correcting unfair labor practices.\n\n\"Our plan gets rid of the NLRB - and reassigns the few necessary responsibilities to more fair and balanced areas of the government,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to level the playing field which will make it easier to create more jobs and higher wages.\u201d\n\n\"Next, we must take on the big government union bosses in Washington - just like I did in Wisconsin.\u201d\n\nRelated: Scott Walker, the \u2018Do It My Way\u2019 Gov, Enters 2016 Race\n\nWalker, who rose to prominence as governor in 2011 by slashing taxes and clashing with state employees over collective bargaining rights, has stressed his anti-union credentials since launching his presidential campaign in July. After making an early big splash with grass roots conservatives in Iowa and capturing an early lead in some national polls, Walker \u2013 like other traditional candidates -- has been totally eclipsed by billionaire Donald Trump and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson.\n\nHe scored a shockingly low 3 percent Republican approval rating in a new Washington Post/ABC News national poll published on Sunday \u2013 down 11 percentage points from the last survey conducted in July. He has also suffered major hemorrhaging of support in Iowa, according to a recent Quinnipiac University poll.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Wisconsin Gov.", "title": "Walker Promises Sweeping Assault on Labor Unions", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/14/Walker-Promises-Sweeping-Assault-Labor-Unions", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-politics-walker_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/14/Walker-Promises-Sweeping-Assault-Labor-Unions", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-politics-walker_1.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Wisconsin Gov.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6104\"", "article_summary": "The NLRB is an independent government agency responsible for conducting elections to determine labor union representation and for investigating and correcting unfair labor practices.\nA 2014 Gallup survey of Americans\u2019 attitudes about the labor movement showed that only 53 percent still approve of unions and their goals.\n\"Any economic plan that does not bring our federal labor laws into the 21st Century is incomplete,\u201d Walker says in excerpts of his speech released by his campaign.\nScott Walker, desperate to revive his sinking presidential campaign, unveiled a plan Monday that would essentially wipe out eight decades of industrial labor relations law, dismantle major public employees\u2019 unions and end a requirement that public works projects pay the prevailing wage to construction workers.\nFrom a strategic political standpoint, Walker is certain to find considerable public sympathy for his views."}
