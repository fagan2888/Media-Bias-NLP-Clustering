In this, they have failed spectacularly. In the last couple of years, 12 of the co-ops have shut their doors, costing doctors and hospitals million of dollars in losses. This year, some experts are predicting that up to 8 of the 11 remaining co-ops will go under as well.\n\nDaily Caller:\n\n\"In general, there\u2019s not a turnaround in sight. The same problems that plagued them before are continuing,\u201d Thomas P. Miller, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who previously served as the senior health economist for the congressional Joint Economic Committee, told TheDCNF.\n\nObamacare advocates hoped the tax-funded non-profit co-ops would successfully compete with for-profit commercial insurance companies and drive down healthcare costs and eventually become permanent fixtures in the marketplace.\n\nState insurance regulators are already liquidating in the 12 states where the co-ops already have closed their doors.\n\nIn some states like New York, hospitals and doctors are facing hundreds of millions in losses that will not be covered by the assets of the failed co-op, Health Republic of New York.\n\nData compiled by TheDCNF based on the co-op 2015 annual reports suggest eight are likely to default and only four of them will be in business by year\u2019s end.\n\nThe co-op documents obtained by TheDCNF were annual reports filed before state insurance regulators. The reports must accurately depict the financial health of the co-ops and are current through the end of calendar year 2015. The annual reports became available to the public in mid-March.\n\nThe Department of Financial Services of New York is also conducting an official investigation into Health Republic, alleging the co-op did not accurately describe its financial condition to regulators.\n\nEarlier this year, Mandy Cohen, a top official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), told Congress eight co-ops are facing special scrutiny because of their poor financial statuses.\n\nShe said an \u201cenhanced oversight\u201d program is in place for some troubled co-ops and others are operating under a federally imposed \u201ccorrective action plan.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2016/04/8_of_the_11_remaining_obamacare_co_ops_set_to_fail_this_year.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: 8 of the 11 remaining Obamacare co-ops set to fail this year"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "This year, some experts are predicting that up to 8 of the 11 remaining co-ops will go under as well.\nThe reports must accurately depict the financial health of the co-ops and are current through the end of calendar year 2015.\nThe annual reports became available to the public in mid-March.\nThe Obamacare co-ops are tax-funded non-profit entities that were supposed to compete with private insurance companies.\nThe co-op documents obtained by TheDCNF were annual reports filed before state insurance regulators."}
