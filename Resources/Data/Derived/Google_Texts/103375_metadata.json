While the one-step-away Avs of old could often afford to gamble on expensive rentals and part with young prospects or draft picks and justify it to their fans, the Avs of the present are thinking beyond this spring.\n\nA young team in the midst of its most successful season in years, the Avs are not about to trade away first-round draft picks or top prospects in their system with the kinds of trades the St. Louis Blues made Friday \u2014 when they acquired Ryan Miller and Steve Ott from Buffalo in exchange for a boatload of young talent.\n\nHere\u2019s where it gets tricky, though: While the Avs cannot justify importing expensive rentals, as they could in the days of Ray Bourque, Theo Fleury and Rob Blake, neither can they be stuck in the situation of having essentially their own rental player on the roster beyond Wednesday in the form of top players with expiring contracts.\n\nThat\u2019s where it could get interesting with a player such as Paul Stastny. While the Avs would like to re-sign as many players in the last year of their contracts as they can, Stastny\u2019s situation is trickier because of his potential status as an unrestricted free agent July 1.\n\nIf the Avs can\u2019t reach agreement on a new deal by Wednesday \u2014 or lack the confidence they can sign him at some point before July 1 \u2014 it is possible Stastny could be traded. The worst of all worlds for the Avs would be to lose a top player such as Stastny for nothing on the unrestricted free-agent market this summer.\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s something I really don\u2019t worry about. You worry about (this week) a little bit, but we have a good thing going here and everyone realizes that,\u201d Stastny said Saturday. \u201cYou want to keep winning and don\u2019t want to break that chemistry, but at the same time if something happens, it happens. It\u2019s just part of the business. Some things I can\u2019t control and I just worry about what I can control \u2014 and that\u2019s playing hockey.\u201d\n\nThe Avs would not comment on any ongoing negotiations with Stastny toward a new contract, and Stastny\u2019s agent, Matt Keator, did not respond for comment. If Stastny is dealt, Avs fans can probably expect a young defenseman in return, someone who can play 20-25 minutes per night, someone with time still left on his existing deal or, if not, restricted free-agent status \u2014 but not unrestricted.\n\nIt would seem that the Avs\u2019 most-preferred course for the rest of this season is to retain their core group \u2014 Stastny included \u2014 and why not? The Avs have been the biggest surprise success story of the season in the NHL, and a big disruption could have unintended consequences.\n\n\u201cThe chemistry is great on this team,\u201d Avalanche executive vice president of hockey operations Joe Sakic said last week. \u201cIt\u2019s a great dressing room. For us, if we do nothing, we\u2019ll be happy. If we can improve our team, and have that vision that whatever we do here is going to be good for the next two or three years, then we\u2019ll try to make our team better. But if it\u2019s status quo, we\u2019ll be happy with that as well.\u201d\n\nAvs coach and vice president of hockey operations Patrick Roy echoes Sakic\u2019s thoughts. He said last week he is \u201cvery happy with the team I have right now. If there is a situation where you can make your team even better, you have to evaluate it, but I like this group and I believe in this group.\u201d\n\nStastny is making $6.6 million this season. He is one of five potential unrestricted free agents, joining John Mitchell (current salary: $1.1 million), Andre Benoit ($900,000), Cory Sarich ($2 million) and Jean-Sebastien Giguere ($1.5 million).\n\nThe Avs also have three potential restricted free agents in Ryan O\u2019Reilly, Tyson Barrie and Jamie McGinn.\n\nAccording to Capgeek.com, with the players already signed through next season, the Avs have a salary cap-averaged payroll of $45,646,429 for 2014-15. The NHL\u2019s salary cap will rise from its current $64.3 million to $71.1 million. The Avs\u2019 current cap-averaged payroll for this season is $52,376,298.\n\nAdrian Dater: adater@denverpost.com or twitter.com/adater\n\nOn the move?\n\nA list of five NHL players most likely to be dealt by Wednesday\u2019s trade deadline:\n\nThomas Vanek, 30, LW, N.Y. Islanders ($5.75 million cap hit, UFA this summer) \u2014 Big winger likely to go to a contender, but Avs aren\u2019t interested\n\nChristian Ehrhoff, 31, D, Buffalo (seven years left on contract, $4 million cap hit) \u2014 Probably too old and would come at too high a cost for Avs to be interested.\n\nRyan Callahan, 28, RW, N.Y. Rangers ($4.275 cap hit, UFA this summer) \u2014 Reports say he wants $7 million per on long-term deal. No interest from Avs.\n\nMatt Moulson, 30, LW, Buffalo ($3.1 million cap hit, UFA this summer) \u2014 Sabres in pure sell-off mode still, even after trading Ryan Miller.\n\nMike Cammalleri, 31, LW, Calgary ($6 million cap hit, UFA this summer) \u2014 Might look good on a contending team, but Avs won\u2019t be involved with him.\n\nSUNDAY: TAMPA BAY AT COLORADO\n\n6 p.m. Sunday, ALT; 950 AM, 104.3 FM\n\nSpotlight on Martin St. Louis: The Lightning captain and leading scorer struck for two goals Saturday in a 4-2 win at Dallas, giving him 29 goals in a season when he has carried the team during Steven Stamkos\u2019 recovery from a broken leg. The 5-foot-8 St. Louis, 38, might choose another team to play for by Wednesday\u2019s trade deadline. He has discussed his future with general manager Steve Yzerman.\n\nNOTEBOOK\n\nLightning: Former University of Denver standout Matt Carle played a team-high 21:05 for Tampa Bay on Saturday as the Lightning snapped a two-game losing streak on the road. \u2026 Steven Stamkos hasn\u2019t played since suffering a broken leg Nov. 11 against Boston. \u2026 Rookie Tyler Johnson, 23, is among those chasing the Avs\u2019 Nathan MacKinnon, 18, for the Calder Trophy. Tampa Bay beat Colorado 5-2 on Jan. 30 in Florida, when Johnson had three goals for his first career hat trick.\n\nAvalanche: The Avs didn\u2019t practice Saturday but convened at their practice complex for off-ice activities. \u2026 Defenseman Erik Johnson will be back in the lineup after serving a two-game NHL suspension for slashing. Coach Patrick Roy said he might go with an 11-forward, seven-defenseman lineup to avoid having to scratch a defenseman to replace Johnson. \u2026 Semyon Varlamov will start in goal.\n\nMike Chambers, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Paul Stastny, Avs could part ways if new deal not done by Wednesday", "title": "Paul Stastny, Avs could part ways if new deal not done by Wednesday", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/01/paul-stastny-avs-could-part-ways-if-new-deal-not-done-by-wednesday/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140114__paul-stastny-avs-011414ap1-3.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140114__paul-stastny-avs-011414ap1-3.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-01T15:17:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T19:02:58+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1ca9\"", "article_summary": "Matt Moulson, 30, LW, Buffalo ($3.1 million cap hit, UFA this summer) \u2014 Sabres in pure sell-off mode still, even after trading Ryan Miller.\nRyan Callahan, 28, RW, N.Y.
