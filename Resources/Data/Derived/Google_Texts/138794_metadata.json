He then asked the senator if there is \u201cany hope of getting it straightened out.\u201d\n\nDurbin responded:\n\nBob, let\u2019s look at the bottom line. Ten million Americans have health insurance today who would not have had it without the Affordable Care Act \u2014 10 million. And we can also say this. It is going to reduce the deficit more than we thought it would.\n\nWe\u2019re seeing a decline in the growth of the cost of health care, exactly our goal in passing this original legislation. I\u2019m finding people, as I go across Illinois, who \u2014 for the first time in their lives \u2014 have an opportunity for affordable health insurance for their families.\n\n\u201cNow, there are many Republicans who are wishing that this fails, hoping they can find any shred of evidence against it,\u201d the Illinois Democrat asserted.\n\n\u201cWe had a bad rollout. Let\u2019s concede that point,\u201d he said. \u201cSince then, we are gaining steam. And I think, ultimately, we\u2019re going to find you can\u2019t go back. You have to extend the health insurance protection to the 25, 30 million Americans who will ultimately have it, and we\u2019ll be a better nation for it.\u201d\n\nHowever, according to an online article by the Post\u2019s appointed \u201cfact checker\u201d Glenn Kessler: \u201cSometimes, talking points persist even in the face of new evidence negating the previous claims.\u201d\n\n\n\nKessler stated that \u201cDurbin appears to be combining two figures released by the administration: more than three million signing up for insurance through the federal HealthCare.gov and state exchanges, and 6.3 million deemed eligible for Medicaid.\u201d\n\nBut there are big problems with both numbers, the reporter noted.\n\nFirst, \u201cthe troubled federal exchange counts people as enrolled if an individual has selected a plan, but it does not know if a person enrolled and paid a premium because that part of the system has yet to be built.\u201d\n\nSecond, the Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid eligibility, but \u201cno one really knows how many of the 6.3 million are in this expansion pool \u2014 or whether they are simply renewing or would have qualified for Medicaid before the new law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese figures must be treated with caution,\u201d he noted, but \u201cDurbin went a step further and claimed that all of these people would not have had health insurance if not for the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s simply ridiculous,\u201d Kessler said, since it is impossible to verify the White House claims. About all one can say with certainty is that the number of people who signed up and got new health insurance is no more than four million, and even that estimate is \u201cextraordinarily generous.\u201d\n\nAlso, Kessler sharply criticized Durbin, stating that given the \u201cfuzzy nature\u201d of the numbers and the wide publicity devoted to recent surveys, he \u201chas little excuse for going on national television and claiming that every one of these people had been previously uninsured. This has now become a Four Pinocchio violation.\u201d\n\nSoon after the article appeared, Durbin spokesman Max Gleischman released this statement:\n\nFact check after fact check has confirmed that more than nine million Americans have signed up for private health insurance or Medicaid coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Many of the more than nine million Americans are being covered for the first time.\n\nNo matter the number of new enrollees, there is no question that the law is working, and millions of people are realizing the benefits of affordable health coverage and the protections it guarantees.\n\nThe Fact Checker responded that he is \u201cunaware of any fact checks that have confirmed these figures as all ACA enrollments or evidence that \u2018many\u2019 of the enrollees are being covered for the first time.\u201d\n\nRegarding ObamaCare\u2019s impact on the federal budget deficit, a recent Congressional Budget Office report did not suggest that ObamaCare would bring down the deficit. Instead, it is expected to rise uncontrollably after 2015.\n\nIt comes as no surprise that such a devoted ObamaCare supporter doesn\u2019t let reality get in the way of his opinion. Perhaps in the future, Durbin will check his facts before making more wild claims.\n\nEditor\u2019s note.
