Consider this week\u2019s Senate filibuster of a three-month extension of unemployment benefits, which despite the support of a majority of Americans failed to advance. It got 55 votes, a clear majority, but thanks to the filibuster rule a 45-senator minority blocked it.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTry explaining that to a laid-off worker struggling to survive another week in the bleak mid-winter, or to a high schooler whose textbooks explain how our government operates on the principle of majority rule. Americans are turned off by the procedural games that make our government appear dysfunctional - which is exactly the point for the faction of senators now calling the shots.\n\nThis is unacceptable. And next week, three federal judges have a rare chance to start fixing it.\n\nAlthough the Senate moved to end the 60-vote threshold on nominations last November, the filibuster\u2019s anti-democratic rule remains in place for Supreme Court nominees and for every bill or resolution that comes to the Senate floor.\n\nA lawsuit brought by Common Cause, four members of the House of Representatives and three immigrants seeking American citizenship seeks to declare the 60-vote filibuster rule unconstitutional. Whether any party has standing to bring this claim will be argued on Tuesday in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe filibuster\u2019s 60-vote provision is an accident of history that violates the bedrock principle of majority rule upon which our democracy was founded. Our system of government \u2013 with its carefully calibrated checks and balances - guards against knee-jerk majoritarianism that runs roughshod over the rights of the minority. For example, the House is apportioned by population where every person is equally represented, while each state enjoys equal voting power in the Senate. At the same time, the Constitution requires a supermajority to impeach a president, override a veto, amend the Constitution or ratify a treaty.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing in the Constitution about a supermajority requirement to pass legislation. The founders considered and rejected such a mandate because it could be used \u201cto embarrass the administration, to destroy the energy of government\u201d and subject decisions of Congress to \u201cthe caprice, or artifices of an insignificant, turbulent, or corrupt junta,\u201d Alexander Hamilton wrote. Who needs government shutdowns to \u201cdestroy the energy of government\u201d when blocking the Senate from legislating will do?\n\nThe founders notwithstanding, the filibuster rule\u2019s defenders today rely on a constitutional provision granting each house of Congress exclusive authority to write its own rules. They say it leaves the courts powerless to hear challenges to the constitutionality of those rules. But if a court can rule on whether a law like the Affordable Care Act exceeds congressional power, surely it can also decide if a chamber\u2019s procedural rule exceeds that power.\n\nIn fact, the Supreme Court long ago held in United States v. Ballin that Congress \u201cmay not by its rules ignore constitutional restraints\u201d on its operation. And earlier this month, justices heard another case touching on a symptom of Senate gridlock, NLRB v. Noel Canning. In that case, the justices examined the scope of the President\u2019s authority to install through recess appointments nominees blocked from confirmation by the historic backlog of Senate filibusters.\n\nIt is the courts\u2019 duty to rule on such questions of law, including the scope of the Senate\u2019s power to distort the legislative process by cloaking supermajority requirements in the language of mere Senate rules.\n\nWe can no longer tolerate obstruction for obstruction\u2019s sake as a governing strategy. The unconstitutional filibuster rule undermines our representative democracy because it nullifies the outcome of elections. The 60-vote rule is no longer the exception to the rule, but the rule itself. It\u2019s time for the rule to go.\n\nSpaulding is staff counsel at Common Cause.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Today\u2019s modus operandi for anti-government crusaders is gridlock and minority rule.", "description": "Today\u2019s modus operandi for anti-government crusaders is gridlock and minority rule.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Today\u2019s modus operandi for anti-government crusaders is gridlock and minority rule.", "title": "Court case challenges the filibuster", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/195816-court-case-challenges-the-filibuster", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:40:00-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:40-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/195816-court-case-challenges-the-filibuster", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-01-20T09:00-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Stephen Spaulding", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-20T09:00:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:40:00-05:00"}, "keywords": ",,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/195816-court-case-challenges-the-filibuster", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Today\u2019s modus operandi for anti-government crusaders is gridlock and minority rule.", "card": "summary", "title": "Court case challenges the filibuster"}, "dcterms.title": "Court case challenges the filibuster"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddf36\"", "article_summary": "The unconstitutional filibuster rule undermines our representative democracy because it nullifies the outcome of elections.\nA lawsuit brought by Common Cause, four members of the House of Representatives and three immigrants seeking American citizenship seeks to declare the 60-vote filibuster rule unconstitutional.\nThe founders notwithstanding, the filibuster rule\u2019s defenders today rely on a constitutional provision granting each house of Congress exclusive authority to write its own rules.\nThe 60-vote rule is no longer the exception to the rule, but the rule itself.\nIt got 55 votes, a clear majority, but thanks to the filibuster rule a 45-senator minority blocked it."}
