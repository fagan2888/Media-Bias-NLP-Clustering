Under the new rules, child car seats sold in the United States, designed for kids weighing up to 40 lbs., would have to go through a rigorous side-impact test before they are authorized for vehicle use.\n\n\"Car seats are an essential tool for keeping young children safe in vehicles and have a proven track record of saving lives,\" said NHTSA Acting Administrator David Friedman in the press release. \"Today we continue to build on our extensive child seat safety program by adding side-impact crash protection for the first time.\"\n\nAn NHTSA study has shown that many child death and injuries commonly occur in side-impact crashes. Typically, in these crashes, the car carrying children is stopped at an intersection \u2014 usually at a light or stop sign \u2014 and when the car begins to go through the intersection, it is struck in the side by a vehicle traveling at a greater speed on the cross street. Unrestrained children are found to be eight times more likely to sustain incapacitating injuries than children restrained in child safety seats. However, the agency believes designing child car seats to withstand side collisions will greatly reduce the number of deaths and injuries per year.\n\nThe feds\u2019 proposed test will aim to simulate a T-bone crash where the front of a vehicle traveling 30 mph will strike the side of a small passenger vehicle traveling at 15 mph. The NHTSA chose these speeds because they are known to cover over 90 percent of side collisions seen not only in the U.S., but around the world.\n\nRather than using actual vehicles, the tests will include sleds because \u201cthe aim isn't to test the crash worthiness of specific vehicles,\u201d NHTSA officials said. The car seat will be positioned on the sled, with another sled ramming the side of the sled with the seat. The tests will use a to-be-developed side-impact 3-year-old child dummy, along with the NHTSA-approved 12-month-old dummy to accurately reflect the age groups of child car seat users.\n\n\"As a father of two, I know the peace of mind this proposed test will give parents,\" said Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, NBC News reported. \"We all want to make sure our children\u2019s car seats are as safe as possible, and today\u2019s proposal will give parents and car-seat makers important new data on how car seats perform in side crashes.\u201d\n\nInstallation and proper use of safety seats are vital in protecting children in motor vehicles. The NHTSA fact sheet says they can reduce up to 71 percent of fatalities for infants and 54 percent for toddlers. Acknowledging the importance of child vehicle safety, manufacturers like the Dorel Juvenile Group \u2014 the world's largest car-seat maker \u2014 has begun to incorporate small, already-inflated air bags.\n\nSome manufacturers are already taking steps to improve the protection afforded by their car seats in side-impact crashes. The Dorel Juvenile Group, the world's largest car-seat maker, has been incorporating small, already-inflated air bags into some of their models to protect children's heads from injury in side-impact crashes since 2009, Julie Vallese, a spokeswoman for the Columbus, Ind., company told The Associated Press. \"Dorel is committed to side-impact protection,\u201d she said.\n\nThe NHTSA proposed regulations will be open for the public to comment on for 90 days after they are published this week. These regulations will not be final until the agency reviews comments and answers any important issues that may arise upon discussions. The agency acknowledges this can take months and sometimes years, but they are hopeful the process will move quickly.\n\nCar-seat makers would be given a three-year time frame to make any design changes necessary to pass the side-crash tests and abide to regulations if and when they are passed. The new child car seats could save five lives and prevent 64 injuries each year, the NHTSA estimates.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics suggests infants and toddlers ride in a rear-facing car seat until age 2 and then moved to a front-facing seat with a harness until at least age 4. They will then have to be placed into a \u201cseatbelt-positioning booster seat until they\u2019ve reached 4 feet, 9 inches tall and are at least 8 years old.\u201d Children who outgrow their booster seats are recommended to continue to ride the back seat until they\u2019re at least 13 years old.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "child car seats, side-impact crashes, t-bone crashes, side collisions, deaths, injuries, kids, children, toddlers, nhtsa", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Feds propose new child car seat regulations to protect kids in side-impact crashes, but can they effectively reduce deaths and injuries?", "title": "New Child Car Seats May Protect Kids In Side Collisions", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-child-car-seats-may-protect-kids-side-collisions-will-proposal-reduce-deaths-and-injuries-267751", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/23/child-car-safety-seat.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Feds propose new child car seat regulations to protect kids in side-impact crashes, but can they effectively reduce deaths and injuries?", "title": "New Child Car Seats May Protect Kids In Side Collisions", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-child-car-seats-may-protect-kids-side-collisions-will-proposal-reduce-deaths-and-injuries-267751", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/23/child-car-safety-seat.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/23/child-car-safety-seat.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-01-23T15:20:57-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-23T15:20:51-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Feds propose new child car seat regulations to protect kids in side-impact crashes, but can they effectively reduce deaths and injuries?"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb118\"", "article_summary": "However, the agency believes designing child car seats to withstand side collisions will greatly reduce the number of deaths and injuries per year.\nThe new child car seats could save five lives and prevent 64 injuries each year, the NHTSA estimates.\nUnrestrained children are found to be eight times more likely to sustain incapacitating injuries than children restrained in child safety seats.\nThe tests will use a to-be-developed side-impact 3-year-old child dummy, along with the NHTSA-approved 12-month-old dummy to accurately reflect the age groups of child car seat users.\n\"Today we continue to build on our extensive child seat safety program by adding side-impact crash protection for the first time.\""}
