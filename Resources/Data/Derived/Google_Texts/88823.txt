â€” Imagine running barefoot across two continents.

That's exactly what Joseph Michael Kai-Tsu Liu Roqueni is doing to raise money for several education foundations, including The Edible Schoolyard Project in New York and New Orleans.

Roqueni is taking three years to travel 12,000 miles from Montreal to Argentina. He runs about 20 miles a day, four to five times a week.

He stopped in Raleigh Monday night to rest for a couple days before journeying to Wilmington.

Roqueni said he wants people to know that things that seem impossible have to be attempted to be achieved.
