JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - The driver of a Ford Mustang hit a Florida Highway Patrol vehicle early Saturday morning. The trooper was sitting in his patrol car blocking northbound lanes to Riverside Avenue due to an earlier crash investigation.

Nineteen-year-old Megan Pye attempted to travel through the roadblock by driving around the patrol car. As Pye attempted this maneuver, her left side door struck the right front bumper and pushed the bumper of the patrol car.

An investigation into the crash was conducted in which she was later placed under arrest for a DUI and then transported to the Duval County Jail.
