Tenet Healthcare announced Thursday that Howard Hacker has been named senior vice president and chief compliance officer, a role that will begin on May 2. As chief compliance officer, Hacker will manage and oversee the company's ethics and compliance program.

The announcement comes a day after Tenet dropped out of the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index due to its its falling stock price and investor unease over a rocky past few months.

As of Thursday, Tenet's market capitalization was down 50 percent from July 2015, landing at about $2.8 billion. The company lost $140 million last year, reports say, due in part to a False Claims Act settlement.

Hacker will report directly to the Quality, Compliance and Ethics Committee of Tenet's board of directors.

Trevor Fetter, chairman and chief executive officer of Tenet, said in a statement that Hacker's hiring reflects the organization's desire to "operate from a strong foundation of values supported by an effective compliance program."

"Integrity is an essential part of Tenet's culture," said Hacker in a statement.

He replaces Vanessa Benavides, who left Tenet to assume the leadership of compliance and privacy operations at Kaiser Permanente. Previously, Hacker spent more than a decade at Pfizer, where he served in various roles within its legal and compliance teams.
