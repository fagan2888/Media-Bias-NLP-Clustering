1. NFL TO SUSPEND BRONCOS KICKER MATT PRATER

Broncos kicker Matt Prater has been notified by the NFL he will be suspended through the first four games of the season for violating the league’s substance-abuse policy. But as Mike Klis explains, the ban could have been much more severe.

2. PEYTON MANNING CAUGHT TAUNTING

Days after calling out his offense — “We stunk” — in a joint practice with the Texans, Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning was called for taunting D.J. Swearinger in the team’s preseason loss to Houston on Saturday after Swearinger’s hit that gave Wes Welker another concussion. So what did Manning say exactly?

3. VON MILLER SEEMS HAPPY, AGAIN

A new-found attitude has helped the Broncos linebacker’s engaging outward appearance to resurface. His skin might be thicker, but it no longer blocks the good-natured humor within. His guard might never again disappear, but it has thinned to where the smile and jokes are once again evident.

4. CALIFORNIA QUAKE CRITICALLY INJURES 3

A large earthquake caused significant damage and left three critically injured in California’s northern Bay Area early Sunday, igniting fires, sending at least 87 people to a hospital, knocking out power to tens of thousands and sending residents running out of their homes in the darkness.

5. SPECIAL REPORT: TRYING TO LIVE, TRYING TO LEARN

The number of homeless school children in this state has more than tripled in a decade. Some live in cars, campgrounds and shelters, but most double up with other families or live in cheap motels because they’ve lost their own housing.

6. HOW COLORADO CAME TO A FRACKING COMPROMISE

It was July 25, and Gov. John Hickenlooper wanted to talk to his trusted staffer about yet another compromise attempt on fracking measures headed to the November ballot. Other deals had fallen apart, but Hickenlooper wanted to try again to get Congressman Jared Polis, the state’s $30 billion oil and gas industry, and other parties on board.

7. DENVER AFFORDABLE HOUSING EFFORTS FACE UNCERTAINTY

Developers, city officials and affordable housing advocates agree that expanding Denver’s stock of apartments and other rentals holds far more promise for helping low-income people to afford living in the city. But many legal factors stand in the way.

8. RACIAL TRAUMA RAISES QUESTIONS FOR DENVER

Ferguson has become a mirror for other cities. We’d be foolish and foolhardy if we didn’t ask: Could the shooting of an unarmed black man by a police officer happen in Denver, Aurora, Colorado Springs?

9. LANDOWNERS AND OIL, GAS COMPANIES: ROOM FOR BOTH?

Gov. John Hickenlooper is set to name a 20-person commission to recommend to the legislature ways to “minimize land-use conflicts.” But large landowners who own their mineral rights, as well as small landowners who own their rights and band together, already have some clout in dealing with oil and gas operators.

10. GREATNESS ON DISPLAY AT USA PRO CHALLENGE

As a five-time Olympic gold medalist in speed skating who later turned to road cycling, competing in the Giro d’Italia and the Tour de France, Eric Heiden knows what makes a great endurance athlete. He sees those qualities clearly in one rider at the USA Pro Challenge, which wraps up in Denver on Sunday afternoon.
