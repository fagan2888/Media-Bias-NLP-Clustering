Kevin Kelly, R-Stratford, also wants lawmakers to conduct a public hearing to allow consumers to vent their frustrations with Connecticut\u2019s efforts to implement the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nKevin Counihan, the CEO of Access Health CT, appeared before the Insurance and Real Estate Committee on Nov. 22, but that stop \u201craised more questions than answers,\u201d Kelly said during a late-morning press conference in the Legislative Office Building.\n\nThe Stratford lawmaker outlined several issues that he insists need answers, or at least more details.\n\nFor example, Kelly said he learned through media reports earlier this month that about 2,400 individuals received incorrect information while purchasing coverage in October. According to exchange officials, there were errors in the information displayed on the system web pages listing plan designs.\n\nAnd although the Connecticut operation is being held up nationally as an example of a system that is working well, issues also remain regarding the usability of the exchange web site.\n\n\u201cWe should know when they discovered issues on their site, who knew about them, and what decisions were made outside of the public eye,\u201d Kelly said. And though he didn\u2019t provide specific numbers, the senator said he has received \u201cnumerous\u201d informal complaints from the residents of his district.\n\nBut Counihan wrote in a statement released late Wednesday afternoon that the exchange not only corrected the information on the website and identified it with a prominent yellow box and red letters, but also sent letters and made telephone calls to all affected individuals to ensure they had correct data.\n\nKelly said he also is concerned about thousands of residents whose insurance policies either have been or will be discontinued before the year\u2019s end.\n\nHealth plans that were in effect before the federal health law took effect in March 2010 can be renewed as long as they don't change significantly, even though they don\u2019t meet the law\u2019s requirements. These plans are known as \u201cgrandfathered,\u201d and aren\u2019t open to new members.\n\nAlthough insurers are not required to cancel grandfathered plans, they don\u2019t have to continue them. This fall, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the state\u2019s largest insurer, told members their grandfathered plans, about 15,000, were being discontinued.\n\nDec. 23 is the deadline for people who want to buy private insurance through Access Health and have coverage by Jan. 1.\n\nBut the exchange will continue to accept enrollment for private insurance through March 31, and people can apply for Medicaid at any point in the year. Access Health\u2019s goal is to have 100,000 people signed up for coverage in 2014.\n\n\u201cWe are moving along at a very brisk pace as it relates to actually enrolling people in coverage,\u201d exchange spokesman Jason Madrak said during a meeting of the state\u2019s Health Care Cabinet earlier this month.", "article_metadata": {"original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2013/12/18/gop-senator-wants-hearing-access-health-ct-problems/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "The top Republican on the legislature\u2019s insurance committee wants the head of Connecticut\u2019s health exchange to answer more questions -- publicly -- about problems with the system.
