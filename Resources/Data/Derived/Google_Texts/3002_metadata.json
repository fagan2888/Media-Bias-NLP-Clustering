He was the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, rock-ribbed conservative from West Central Ohio. His district is represented today by John Boehner.\n\nAnd he was just as conservative as John Boehner in most ways, but he was a fierce supporter of civil rights. His ancestors had been abolitionists before the Civil War, and as a young man out of law school at Ohio State, he\u2019d gone to practice down in Jacksonville, Florida, and was appalled by Jim Crow segregation, and made it his business to become a strong supporter of federal civil rights legislation.\n\nGWEN IFILL: It\u2019s easy to look at the way things happen on Capitol Hill now and the way they happened then, and you have to think to yourself, where does a Bill McCulloch get the room to run, to be that kind of advocate?\n\nTODD PURDUM: Yes, I mean, he had a population in his district that was 2.7 percent black, but he had something else, which was, the Republican Party in those days still took very seriously its legacy as the party of Lincoln and the party of civil rights.\n\nAnd remember that, for most of the 20th century, to the degree that either party was paying attention to civil rights, it really was the Republicans. Most black people in the South were Republicans. So McCulloch made a deal with the Kennedy administration when they proposed the bill.\n\nHe said, if you promise not to water this down in the Senate, as had been the usual practice, and if you promise to give us Republicans equal credit going into next year\u2019s presidential election, I will bring along my Republican Caucus. And that\u2019s just what happened.\n\nBut could you imagine that happening today, one party removing the single most contentious domestic issue, as a political issue, and working cooperatively?\n\nGWEN IFILL: A greater percentage of Republicans in the Senate in the end voted for it than Democrats.\n\nTODD PURDUM: By far, because the Senate Democrats were totally divided on the question of civil rights, the Southerners, 18 Southerners lockstep in unison against any change.\n\nAnd if it weren\u2019t for the Republican leader Everett Dirksen of Illinois and his colleagues, they could never have achieved cloture and passed the bill.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Bill McCulloch\u2019s partner in all of this was a Democrat who was very much unlike him. He was from an urban area, Emanuel Celler from New York.\n\nTODD PURDUM: Yes, from Brooklyn. He was an immigration lawyer. He was a staunch defender of liberalism in all its guises.\n\nHe\u2019d been in Congress for already by this point something more than 40 years. And he and McCulloch were polar opposites in many ways, but they were close friends, and they and their wives socialized together. So while McCulloch was trying to work with the Kennedy administration, Manny Celler was having to deal with the civil rights coalition and the advocacy groups who wanted the strongest possible bill.\n\nAnd in the fall of 1963, they came to kind of a clash because the administration was afraid that the bill would be so loaded up with a Christmas tree of items that it couldn\u2019t pass, and they had to work to work a compromise.\n\nGWEN IFILL: In the popular retelling, Lyndon Johnson gets a huge amount of credit, a great deal of which he deserves, in getting this bill through the House and the Senate just by sheer force of will.\n\nYou describe him in the book as a riddle \u2014 a sprawling riddle wrapped in an enigma. I love that term. So what was it about Lyndon Johnson that deserved the credit for getting this through, and how much of the credit did he not deserve?\n\nTODD PURDUM: Well, the credit he deserves is being fiercely in favor of it, and never compromising, never weakening the bill.\n\nAfter all, his reputation was as a master wheeler-dealer, who in 1957 and 1960 had watered down the civil rights bills so they could pass the Senate. But, in this case, he said, we\u2019re going to pass the bill the Kennedy administration had. It\u2019s going to be a strong bill. I\u2019m going to sort of make my bona fides on civil rights, and there\u2019s not going to be any doubt about it.\n\nHe never wiggled. But the other thing that I think is quite admirable and against the popular image, he had to restrain himself, he had to hold himself in check. He knew that he couldn\u2019t go in and micromanage the process in the Senate, because his former colleagues would resent him.\n\nSo even though he resisted it and he was champing at the bit at the pace that Hubert Humphrey, the floor leader, and Mike Mansfield, the majority leader, were setting, he let them have their day, and they prevailed.\n\nGWEN IFILL: You tell a story about \u2014 some point during the debate, there was a black man in the gallery who was watching this as a citizen. What happened to him?\n\nTODD PURDUM: Well, he said, this is crazy. There\u2019s not a single black person on the floor. You\u2019re talking about 10 percent of the population here. How can you be doing this?\n\nHe was taken off to Washington Hospital for mental observation, but it was a very reasonable statement to have made.\n\nGWEN IFILL: It was a reasonable point. But there were a lot of African-Americans civil rights activists, Clarence Mitchell among them, who were basically in the gallery watching.\n\nTODD PURDUM: All the time. All the time.\n\nThere were five black members of Congress, but we forget people like Clarence Mitchell, who was the chief NAACP lobbyist in Washington. He was such a constant presence in the corridors of this building and the Capitol that he was known as the 101st senator.\n\nAnd he was there day and night; in fact, he and his colleague Joe Rauh, who was with the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, when the bill was about ready to pass the House, they were in the gallery, and they got a frantic call from the White House operator that the president\u2019s trying to find them wanting to know what they\u2019re going to do about the Senate, before it\u2019s even passed the House.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nGWEN IFILL: Before it even passed the House.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting because, when you look back on it now, there were all these pressures coming from all these different angles, but in the end, was it a legislative victory, was it a moral victory? What was really driving people to what we \u2014 to the outcome?\n\nTODD PURDUM: Well, that\u2019s a great question.\n\nAnd I think at the end of the day, you have to say it was a moral victory, because it wasn\u2019t just the insiders here on Capitol Hill who were doing it. There was a massive grassroots coalition of church groups, interfaith groups of all kinds, not just Dr. King and the SCLC and the marchers on Washington, but people in their communities day after day lobbying their members, knowing that, you know, this person was a Catholic and that person was a Methodist, and you should bring to bear.\n\nAnd it was really President Kennedy in his speech proposing the bill who said, we face primarily a moral issue. It\u2019s as old as the Scriptures and as clear as the American Constitution. And at the end of the day, even the Southerners said, you couldn\u2019t fight the golden rule. You couldn\u2019t fight do unto others as you would have them do unto you. It\u2019s the most basic idea of fairness.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Fifty years later, it\u2019s hard to remember why people objected to what seems to be a given now, equal rights and a level playing field, which is how Johnson put it.\n\nBut, at the time, this was an argument which was familiar to us now, which is an argument against government expansion and government expansion over basic people\u2019s control.\n\nTODD PURDUM: This was going to be a government takeover. This was going to be a usurpation of private property rights.\n\nThis was going to tell businessmen who they had to serve and who they \u2014 it\u2019s so much like the arguments that were made against the Affordable Care Act, that you can\u2019t force people to buy insurance. That\u2019s un-American. That\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s going to destroy the Constitution. It\u2019s going to create an army of snoops from Washington. It\u2019s going to \u2014 and it\u2019s very, that part of the argument that was in fact \u2014 sounded very familiar to me as I was doing my research.\n\nAnd it occurred to me there\u2019s probably not any nasty e-mail that could ever cross President Obama\u2019s desk that would too much surprise John Kennedy or Lyndon Johnson in terms of the kind of vituperative mail they got.\n\nGWEN IFILL: As you were working on this book and you looked back in that 50-year span, did you \u2014 and you have spent a lot of time in Washington covering the issues of the day. Do you feel like Washington has grown in that time, or did it stop? Did its ability to do big things end then?\n\nTODD PURDUM: It seems that the poignant part of this story is that this and the Voting Rights Act are two of the last great achievements Congress managed to do.\n\nAnd in some ways, the coalition that brought these bills into being began to splinter as the \u201960s wore on, and debates grew up about affirmative action and busing and Vietnam. Dr. King and Lyndon Johnson were essentially estranged at the time of his death because of Vietnam.\n\nSo the paradox for me is that, 50 years ago, the country was every bit as divided as it is now, probably more divided. But the Congress still managed to work together. Now Congress is much more divided than the country as a whole, partly because the districts are redder and redder and bluer and bluer, and people are worried not about losing in November, but getting a primary from the right or the left.\n\nSo I do worry that we have lost something essential that we really \u2014 we really depended on 50 years ago. And just as we seem awfully lucky to have had the particular cast of characters we did at the time of the founding, it seems to me that 50 years ago, we were pretty lucky to have that cast of characters too.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Todd Purdum, the author of \u201cAn Idea Whose Time Has Come: Two Presidents, Two Parties, and the Battle for the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\u201d thank you so much.\n\nTODD PURDUM: Thanks so much for having me.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wednesday marks 50 years since President Lyndon Johnson signed the landmark Civil Rights Act, outlawing discrimination based on race, ethnicity and sex.
