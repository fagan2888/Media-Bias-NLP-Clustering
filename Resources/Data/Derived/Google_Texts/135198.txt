Hold on to your hats, Denver. A sunny and breezy morning in the city is likely to lead to stronger gusts in the afternoon.

The metro area is expected to have a high of 63 degrees with morning winds anywhere from 13 to 18 miles per hour. Winds later in the day could accelerate to as high as 25 miles per hour, according to the National Weather Service in Boulder.

Gusts should calm down as the day goes on, with a nighttime low around 30 degrees, the weather service said.

In the foothills, the weather service said gusts could reach 40 miles per hour. These high winds could spread east along the Front Range during the middle of the afternoon.

Sunday temperatures are expected to drop with a high near 51, leading into Monday â€” the next chance for snowfall.

During the day, Denver residents can expect mostly sunny skies with a high near 55 and light winds. Come nightfall, forecasters predict a chance of rain before midnight and then a 30 percent chance of snow that increases to a 40 percent chance of snowfall into Tuesday morning.
