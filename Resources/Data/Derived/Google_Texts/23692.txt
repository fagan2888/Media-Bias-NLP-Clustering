Good evening. Here’s the latest.

1. The F.B.I. mustered hundreds of agents after a gunman attacked two military sites in Chattanooga, Tenn., killing four Marines and leaving others injured before being killed. A federal official said the case was being treated “as an act of domestic terrorism.”

2. A Colorado jury rejected the insanity plea of James E. Holmes, finding him guilty of killing 12 and wounding 70 at a Denver movie theater three years ago.

3. The trial date for Dylann Roof, the suspect in the killings of nine blacks in a South Carolina church last month, was set for a year from now. Our latest profile portrays a youth many saw as aimless, troubled and strange, but with no record of violence to prefigure the massacre.

4. E.U. officials agreed to shore up Greece with more loans and credit while working toward a bailout package. But there was little sense of security, particularly after Germany’s finance minister raised, for the second time this week, the idea of Greece leaving the euro.

5. With an eye on China’s rise, Japan took a big step toward allowing itself limited foreign combat powers for the first time since World War II. Its lower house approved security bills backed by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the U.S., but detested by most voters.

6. Golf’s wunderkind Jordan Spieth, left, ended the first day of the British Open two strokes behind Dustin Johnson, right. (Johnson, by the way, is so impetuous that when the portable toilet was occupied, he urinated on the fairway grass.) Two former stars, Tiger Woods and Tom Watson, were among those tied for 141st place.

7. Senate passage of a bill that rewrites the No Child Left Behind law set up a showdown with the House. Both of their bills give local governments more power, but the House’s, passed last week, limits the federal government’s role in education.

8. President Obama visited a prison near Oklahoma City as part of his campaign for reform of the criminal justice system. He reflected on how he had used marijuana and cocaine as a young man, saying, “There but for the grace of God” as he toured a cellblock emptied for his security.

9. The prognosis was good for former president George Bush, who was hospitalized Wednesday after cracking a bone in his neck in a fall at his seaside summer home in Maine. “He’s doing great, his spirits are good, and he’s up and talking, and out of bed,” his doctor said.

10. HBO dominated the Emmy nominations with 126, almost a fifth of them for “Game of Thrones.” Surprise snubs: no drama series nomination for “Empire,” or nods to Gina Rodriguez (“Jane the Virgin”) or Ellie Kemper (“Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt”). The awards are set for Sept. 20.

11. It’s a big week for the star of “Inside Amy Schumer.” Her Emmy nomination for outstanding actress in a comedy series was one of seven for her show, plus her much-anticipated first film, “Trainwreck,” opens Friday.

12. There isn’t even a name for what these stunt skydivers pulled off recently. Dropping from 7,000 feet, one leapt between his two wingsuit-clad teammates, and then went into freefall before deploying his parachute. According to the man who filmed it, the motive was to have a killer video for last month’s edition of an annual extreme sport festival in Voss, Norway.
