In recent years, Trump said he would \u201cpress for universal health care,\u201d claimed that he was \u201cpro-choice in every respect,\u201d remarked that \u201cI hate the concept of guns,\u201d stated that Hillary Clinton would \u201cdo a good job\u201d in negotiating with Iran, asserted that the GOP was \u201cjust too crazy right,\u201d and even said, \u201cIn many cases, I probably identify more as a Democrat.\u201d\n\nLast summer, Donald Trump described Mexican immigrants as \u201cbringing drugs, they\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists.\u201d In December, he called for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d Many commentators claim that this wild rhetoric helps Trump suck up media oxygen or appear like a straight-talking political outsider. But the most important benefit of the anti-immigrant language is that it inoculates Trump against the charge of being a closet liberal.\n\nThe problem for Trump is that he\u2019s running for the nomination of a party in no mood for compromise. The rise of the Tea Party pushed the GOP to the right. There is an entire lexicon devoted to condemning Republican moderates: \u201csquish,\u201d \u201cRepublicans in name only\u201d (RINOs), \u201cmilquetoast,\u201d or, of course, \u201cestablishment Republicans.\u201d GOP candidates are routinely assailed for deviating from conservative orthodoxy, including Mitt Romney\u2019s backing \u201cRomneycare\u201d as governor of Massachusetts, Senator Marco Rubio\u2019s past support for immigration reform, or Ohio Governor John Kasich\u2019s expansion of Medicaid.\n\nA 2013 poll found that most Republicans wanted a congressman who \u201csticks to their principles no matter what,\u201d over someone who \u201ccompromises to get things done.\u201d By contrast, large majorities of Democrats and Independents preferred someone who would bargain with the opposition. Similarly, last October, a poll found that 62 percent of Republicans wanted leaders who refuse to compromise on principle even if it risked a government shutdown, whereas more than three-quarters of Democrats favored cutting deals with the GOP to avoid gridlock.\n\nOne of the great puzzles of the primary season is why a candidate who so recently espoused moderate or progressive views is succeeding in a party that favors purity over pragmatism. Of course, Trump can always claim that he had a road-to-Damascus-style conversion to conservatism. But this claim surely won\u2019t cut it for many movement conservatives. After all, if Trump can flip to the right so recently, perhaps he\u2019ll flop back to the left in due course.\n\nFor Trump, the solution has been to announce something so outrageously offensive to liberals, so contrary to every progressive shibboleth, that its utterance immediately disqualifies him from being a leftist. Opposing Obamacare isn\u2019t good enough. After all, some progressives aren\u2019t big fans of the Affordable Care Act. Neither is it sufficient to back gun rights. Many on the left own guns and believe in the Second Amendment. In any case, these are issues on which reasonable people can disagree. What Trump needs is something that is literally unspeakable for a liberal. Trump\u2019s immigration policy is just the ticket. Virtually no progressive would dream of banning the world\u2019s 1.6 billion Muslims from visiting the United States. The very idea represents a kind of exclusionary nativism that is anathema to liberals. Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant language is an efficient way of proving that he has abandoned the left. In a single glorious moment of illiberal demagoguery, he can achieve what would otherwise take months of debate and rebuttal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Why Donald Trump&#39;s anti-immigration rhetoric was enough for movement conservatives to forgive his history of liberalism.", "author": "Dominic Tierney", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Why Donald Trump's anti-immigration rhetoric was enough for movement conservatives to forgive his history of liberalism.", "title": "Trump\u2019s Unspeakable Strategy to Erase His Past", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/02/AP_360172132216/facebook.jpg?1454348879", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/trumps-unspeakable-strategy-to-erase-his-past/458748/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/dominictierneyauthor"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb61f\"", "article_summary": "Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant language is an efficient way of proving that he has abandoned the left.\nThe problem for Trump is that he\u2019s running for the nomination of a party in no mood for compromise.\nBut the most important benefit of the anti-immigrant language is that it inoculates Trump against the charge of being a closet liberal.\nTrump has a seemingly fatal vulnerability in the Republican primary: His past support for a host of moderate and liberal positions .\nAfter all, if Trump can flip to the right so recently, perhaps he\u2019ll flop back to the left in due course."}
