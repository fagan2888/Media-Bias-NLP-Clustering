If that end of episode claim is not received in time, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services auto-cancels and the whole process has to restart, resulting in lack of payment for home healthcare agencies and a lot of hassles for everyone.\n\nBut many home healthcare providers find it difficult to keep track of their RAPs, said Bud Meadows, executive vice president of the healthcare technology company ABILITY, which offers a product for RAP tracking.\n\nFor one thing, the majority of home healthcare agencies are small, meaning they have less than $2 million in annual revenue. Lacking financial leverage, many aren\u2019t using the technologies available to track RAPs; a good number, he said, often track the RAP process with \u201csticky notes.\u201d\n\nFamily Home Health Services, which has 11 offices throughout Florida, used to track part of its RAP process using an Excel spreadsheet, said Stacy Patton, billing manager for the organization. \u201cIt was difficult to manage,\u201d she said, because staffers would get busy and forget to put information in the spreadsheet.\n\nFamily Home Health Services primarily relies on its old billing system to help keep track of RAPs. But that is problematic.\n\nOne of the biggest holes in using the old billing system is that it isn\u2019t suited to tracking where RAP-related orders are, Patton said. Signed doctors\u2019 orders are required with the end of episode claim. In order to get signed orders, they\u2019ve created a system wherein they fax orders to doctor\u2019s offices \u2013 multiple times if necessary. If the multiple faxes don\u2019t result in a signed order, they send an account executive to the office.\n\nWhile this part of their RAP monitoring process is still cumbersome and time-consuming, as one of the agencies reporting to Palmetto, they knew they had to make some investment in technology that would make reporting easier and provide them with advance warning that they were in danger of auto-cancellation.\n\nTo that end, they began using an ABILITY product that alerts the main office when they are close to being overdue and tells them what, if anything, is missing from the claim. Patton said their rejection rate was 10 percent to 15 percent before they began using the software, but has been reduced to less than 5 percent.\n\nWhat many home healthcare agencies may not realize, said ABILITY\u2019s Meadows, is that as technology has progressed, affordable technical solutions are available to make the RAP process easier and help them avoid auto-cancellations.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/bad-rap", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/BudMeadows_Headshot.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Despite the hassle of auto-cancellations, many home healthcare agencies find it difficult to keep track of their requests for anticipated payment.", "title": "A bad RAP"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/BudMeadows_Headshot.jpg"}, "title": "A bad RAP", "description": "Despite the hassle of auto-cancellations, many home healthcare agencies find it difficult to keep track of their requests for anticipated payment.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "When Palmetto GBA, the country\u2019s largest home health and hospice Medicare administrative contractor, announced last year it planned to suppress payments to home health agencies identified as having a high number of auto-cancelled requests for anticipated payment, Palmetto\u2019s decision forced many in the home healthcare industry to increase their efforts to track and send claims in the time frame allotted.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcca6f\"", "article_summary": "For one thing, the majority of home healthcare agencies are small, meaning they have less than $2 million in annual revenue.\nBut many home healthcare providers find it difficult to keep track of their RAPs, said Bud Meadows, executive vice president of the healthcare technology company ABILITY, which offers a product for RAP tracking.\nAfter sending out a RAP and receiving some payment, home healthcare agencies have 60 days to submit an end of episode claim to receive the remainder of the payment.\nWhat many home healthcare agencies may not realize, said ABILITY\u2019s Meadows, is that as technology has progressed, affordable technical solutions are available to make the RAP process easier and help them avoid auto-cancellations.\nIf that end of episode claim is not received in time, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services auto-cancels and the whole process has to restart, resulting in lack of payment for home healthcare agencies and a lot of hassles for everyone."}
