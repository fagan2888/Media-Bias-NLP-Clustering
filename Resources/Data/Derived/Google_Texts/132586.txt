AcelRx said the FDA previously indicated that the bench tests and two human factors studies AcelRx performed to assess inadvertent dispensing and risk of dispensing failures were acceptable.

AcelRx said it plans to meet with the FDA to discuss the need for an additional clinical study. The stock's selloff puts it on track to open at a five-month low. Through Friday, it had surged 32% in the past three months, while the S&P 500 has gained 0.6%.
