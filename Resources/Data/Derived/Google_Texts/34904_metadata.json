The musical guest on the Tonight Show was Mary J. Blige.\n\nJimmy Fallon began the Tonight Show by welcoming his audience and then he did his nightly monologue. Some jokes from it follow, somewhat paraphrased.\n\n\u201cWhat a show to come to! What a show to be at! Here\u2019s what everyone\u2019s talking about. Last week, President Obama and Michelle sent out the very first ever interactive holiday card. It opens up and you have to sign up for ObamaCare.\u201d\n\n\u201cBit of a scandal \u2014 President Putin bribed a soccer official with a Picasso. \u2018It wasn\u2019t a Picasso, it was a warning \u2014 eyes here, nose there,'\u201d Fallon said, imitating Putin.\n\nThen, Jimmy Fallon joked \u201cA brewery in Oregon is coming out with a Sirachi flavored beer. It\u2019s perfect to find out if you\u2019re really an alcoholic.\u201d\n\nAfter that, The Roots played Jimmy Fallon to his desk, where he talked about upcoming guests like Reese Witherspoon, Cameron Diaz, Chris Rock and The Foo Fighters. He also mentioned tonight\u2019s guests, like Martin Short, and Gabrielle Union from the movie Top Five. He and Steve Higgins, the announcer of the Tonight Show, then mentioned seeing the musical guest at dinner and sending over their bill to her table, to mess with her \u2014 Mary J. Blige.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a guy who asks the hard-hitting questions \u2014 Jiminy Glick, from Talk of the Town,\u201d Jimmy Fallon said. Glick is, of course, Martin Short. He told Fallon \u201cI usually talk to celebrities. I can tell from the grammar, limited education.\u201d\n\nGlick asked him how doing American Idol was, and Fallon said \u201cI\u2019m not Ryan Seacrest.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, God \u2014 I\u2019m really not prepared for this,\u201d Glick said. He stuffed and entire doughnut into his mouth, then grabbed Fallon\u2019s doughnut and put it into his mouth. Fallon had to perform the Heimlich Maneuver on him.He asked Fallon about Timberlake, saying \u201cTop or bottom?\u201d\n\nFallon said \u201cYou\u2019re trying to get a reaction out of me.\u201d It was a pretty hilarious comedy segment. Fallon said he will be interviewing Martin Short when the Tonight Show comes back. Short has a new book out, I Must Say: My Life as a Humble Comedy Legend.\n\n\u201cI adore being overwhelmed by love like that!\u201d Martin said. \u201cThis is my first appearance on the Tonight Show! I mean your energy, it\u2019s so insane! You look tremendous. You lost the muffin top.\u201d Short then called the announcer, Steve Higgins, \u201cAndy Richter,\u201d and said he had not seen The Roots \u201csince the Charlie Manson bachelor party.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you love comedy, you have to read this book,\u201d Jimmy Fallon said about Short\u2019s book. Martin told him the characters he created were based on real people he has known. There is also an audio book people can get. Fallon also talked with Martin about a new movie he is in, Inherent Vice, where he plays \u201ca cocaine-addicted guy obsessed with having sex with younger women,\u201d in short\u2019s words.\n\n\u201cYou pretty much always play that guy,\u201d Jimmy Fallon said. He showed a clip from the movie, then said they would be playing Pictionary when the Tonight Show returned from another commercial break.\n\nJimmy Fallon introduced Miranda Sings and Jerry Seinfeld, his special guests who will play Pictionary with Fallon and Martin Short. Fallon and Short were on one team, while Miranda drew first for Jerry.\n\n\u201cYou can go now, Miranda! There\u2019s a time limit on this,\u201d Jerry said. She had hardly anything drawn, when the time ran out. It was supposed to be \u201cMistletoe.\u201d\n\nJimmy tried to draw \u201cHang Gliding.\u201d Short eventually said \u201cHang Glider,\u201d which was close, but they did not get the points.\n\nNext, Jerry drew for Miranda. He tried to draw \u201cFoot in the Door.\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s an expression,\u201d he told her. Jerry talked too much, trying to give clues; but, Miranda still did not get the answer right.\n\nMartin Short was next to draw, a \u201cPiggy Bank.\u201d\n\n\u201cDevil bank, bank teller, snowman,\u201d Fallon said.\n\n\u201cI guess you don\u2019t know art,\u201d Martin told Fallon.\n\nMartin told Miranda \u201cYou\u2019re going down!\u201d and she acted as if she was crying. Both Miranda and Martin drew at the same time \u2014 it was supposed to be \u201cMrs. Claus.\u201d Jerry was looking at Short\u2019s drawing, which did not help at all. \u201cYou guys, this is the first-ever tie,\u201d Fallon said. Nobody got any points whatsoever.\n\nWhen The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon came back from yet more commercials, Fallon introduced his second guest of the show, Gabrielle Union. \u201cPlease welcome to the show the lovely Gabrielle Union!\u201d Falon said. He asked her about her marriage, saying the last time she was there, she was about to get married.\n\n\u201cWe had John Legend perform, we had Questlove. The highlight had to be the Dance Off,\u201d Gabrielle told Fallon.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s your husband? How\u2019s Dwyane Wade?\u201d\n\n\u201cGod has given him many gifts,\u201d Gabrielle answered. \u201cInside, he\u2019s Usher. Outside, he\u2019s like a toddler.\u201d\n\nJimmy asked her about Top Five, and she said that Chris \u201cis a cool cat.\u201d She also talked about going to a Prince party. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a Plus One,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just have to hope that someoen you know is also going.\u201d She said she told him \u201cIf I had known there was food, I would have brought a tuna casserole.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou play a reality star. There\u2019s a big made-for-TV wedding coming up,\u201d Fallon said.\n\n\u201cYes, and he goes off the rails,\u201d Gabrielle replied. Then, Fallon showed a clip from Top Five.\n\n\u201cMary J Blige performs next, everybody!\u201d Fallon said, and the Tonight Show again went to a break.\n\nFrom her latest album, The London Sessions, Mary J. Blige performed the song Therapy. She knocked the song dead, as usual. The record has her singing with a ton of collaborators, like Sam Smith. Blige had platinum blond hair. She had the audience in the palms of her hands as she sang, and then they clapped along as she sang. Fallon came onstage with her new album, and said it is in stores, now.\n\nThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon was terrific tonight, a great way to start the week off right. Martin Short is always funny, and tonight was no exception, though he was not very good at guessing what Jimmy Fallon tried to draw in Pictionary. That was okay, because Jerry Seinfeld and his partner for the game, Miranda Sings, were not very good at the game, either. It was funny watching them try, though. Gabrielle Union was a very entertaining guest, and Mary J. Blige put on a great musical performance singing Therapy.\n\nWritten By Douglas Cobb\n\nSources:\n\nNBC Universal Media Village\n\nMary J.
