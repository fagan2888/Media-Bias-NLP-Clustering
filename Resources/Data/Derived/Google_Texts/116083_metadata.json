He became an aide to Kemp at the age of 23, and the two remained close up to Kemp\u2019s death in 2009. Ryan seems to be carrying on his legacy well.\n\nAmid the unprecedentedly vitriolic campaign for the Republican nomination, Ryan used his clout as speaker on Wednesday to criticize the ugly nature of political discourse today. In a 14-minute speech, Ryan struck an uplifting tone characteristic of his mentor.\n\n\u201cInstead of playing to your anxieties,\u201d he said, \u201cwe can appeal to your aspirations.\u201d\n\nRyan\u2019s message offered important themes regarding the rejection of identity politics and the importance of compromise. Regardless of political allegiance, Americans should be thankful that Ryan, who has a unique credibility on the subject, had the courage to give this speech.\n\nSome critics have called Ryan hypocritical, saying he is too conservative to be a unifier. They cite his infamously parsimonious budgets and his presence on the Romney ticket in 2012.\n\nYet the extremity of his conservatism is exactly what makes him a good example. Kemp himself was a fiercely committed conservative. The Reagan tax cut of 1981 was Kemp\u2019s brainchild. Nonetheless, Kemp earned a legacy as a unifier.\n\nDespite Ryan\u2019s ideological commitment, he also has a history of being a unifying figure and of proposing positive alternatives to the opposition\u2019s ideas.\n\nMost notably, in 2013, Ryan famously collaborated with Washington Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat and the then chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, to work out a bipartisan budget in a politically divided Congress. This effort was a response to two years of partisanship-induced budget and debt ceiling crises, including the government shutdown that October. When the nation\u2019s credibility was on the line, Ryan stepped up to be a conciliator and provide relief from the crushing impact of sequestration.\n\nAs speaker, his work has continued in this vein. Ryan recently passed a tax and spending bill that the LA Times hailed as a \u201creal give-and-take with Democrats.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Ryan has offered a positive vision for his party \u2014 a party that has spent the past seven years obstructing legislation without proposing alternatives. For instance, unlike his party colleagues, Ryan actually proposed an alternative to the Affordable Care Act, called The Patients\u2019 Choice Act. As speaker, he has worked to \u201cput together a complete alternative to the Left\u2019s agenda.\u201d\n\nRyan has set an example not just for politicians, but also for all Americans. Not only has he brought a conciliatory nature and positive vision to Washington D.C., but he also used the speech to address his own faults \u2014 a rare occurrence for a politician.\n\nHe expressed regret for speaking in terms of \u201cmakers and takers\u201d when running for vice president in 2012, saying that he shouldn\u2019t have \u201ccastigate[d] a large group of Americans to make a point.\u201d While most politicians won\u2019t admit to hyperbolizing \u2014 particularly in this year\u2019s campaign \u2014 Ryan pointed out that this was a dangerous and harmful way to appeal to the public.\n\nAdditionally, this message was an important one for the public in the age of social media, which offers ideological groups a place to cluster and magnify their collective outrage in hyperbolic terms.\n\nMany saw this speech as a rebuke of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. In The Week magazine, Pascal Emmanuel Gobry criticized Ryan\u2019s speech for not attacking Trump directly. But thinking of the speech in this way is a tragic mistake.\n\nAttacking Trump would have undermined Ryan\u2019s message, drawing him into a drawn-out public brawl with the Republican frontrunner. Not only has this proven to be a poor strategy, typically inflating Trump\u2019s support, but it also would have forced Ryan to stoop to Trump\u2019s level, damaging his credibility.\n\nIt seems that this speech was about much more than just Trump. Ryan is smart enough to understand that Trump isn\u2019t the cause of the current atmosphere but a symptom of many larger issues.\n\nTherefore, Ryan\u2019s appeal was not to Trump supporters but to all Americans. From the legislators to the candidates to typical Americans partaking in political debate, Ryan sought to temper the growing repugnance with which people of opposing viewpoints have come to view each other.\n\nLet Americans heed his advice and follow his \u2014 and Kemp\u2019s \u2014 example. Ryan\u2019s speech and his record prove that one can be passionately committed to a set of ideals and still look for common ground in the interest of the collective good. It is through these values that the United States will begin to politically heal itself.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ryan\u2019s speech and record prove that one can be committed to a set of ideals and still look for common ground in the interest of the collective good.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Free Press", "description": "Ryan\u2019s speech and record prove that one can be committed to a set of ideals and still look for common ground in the interest of the collective good.", "title": "YANK-JACOBS: Paul Ryan's speech shows commitment to common ground - The Daily Free Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 3332, "identifier": "http://dailyfreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/kobeheadshot.jpg", "height": 3332}, "url": "http://dailyfreepress.com/2016/03/27/paul-ryans-speech-shows-commitment-common-ground/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ryan\u2019s speech and record prove that one can be committed to a set of ideals and still look for common ground in the interest of the collective good.", "creator": "@dailyfreepress", "image": "http://dailyfreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/kobeheadshot.jpg", "title": "YANK-JACOBS: Paul Ryan's speech shows commitment to common ground - The Daily Free Press", "site": "@dailyfreepress", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://dailyfreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/cropped-DFP_Lettering_Final-07-270x270.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/dailyfreepress/", "section": "Columns", "tag": "Washington D.C.", "published_time": "2016-03-27T23:30:16-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1c7f\"", "article_summary": "Ryan\u2019s speech and his record prove that one can be passionately committed to a set of ideals and still look for common ground in the interest of the collective good.\nIn a 14-minute speech, Ryan struck an uplifting tone characteristic of his mentor.\nIn The Week magazine, Pascal Emmanuel Gobry criticized Ryan\u2019s speech for not attacking Trump directly.\nDespite Ryan\u2019s ideological commitment, he also has a history of being a unifying figure and of proposing positive alternatives to the opposition\u2019s ideas.\nAttacking Trump would have undermined Ryan\u2019s message, drawing him into a drawn-out public brawl with the Republican frontrunner."}
