For over half a century, Cubans have remained under the boot of the Western Hemisphere\u2019s longest-running military dictatorship,\u201d Quintana said, adding that Cuba had been \u201cpromoting anti-Americanism.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Coolidge traveled to Cuba on a U.S. battleship, so this will be a very different kind of visit,\u201d Ben Rhodes, Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser, noted in a Medium post Thursday morning.\n\nA little over a year ago, Obama pledged with Cuba\u2019s President Ra\u00fal Castro to reopen diplomatic channels.\n\n14 months ago, I announced that we would begin normalizing relations with Cuba \u2013 and we've already made significant progress. \u2014 President Obama (@POTUS) February 18, 2016\n\nRhodes wrote:\n\nLast summer, we restored diplomatic relations and Secretary of State John Kerry traveled to Cuba to raise the American flag over our Embassy. This enhanced diplomatic presence makes it much easier for the United States to advance our interests and values in Cuba, as we do in countries around the world. \u2026 Changes in U.S. policies and regulations have allowed for greater travel and commerce between our countries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so abhorrent any way that you look at it,\u201d Quintana told The Daily Signal. \u201cU.S. presidents are not supposed to be in support of military dictatorships, especially if it\u2019s not in our national interest.\u201d\n\nOur flag flies over our Embassy in Havana once again. More Americans are traveling to Cuba than at any time in the last 50 years. \u2014 President Obama (@POTUS) February 18, 2016\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement marks a huge step toward successfully rejecting failed policies that are rooted in the Cold War and creating opportunities that will engage and empower the Cuban people,\u201d the White House announced.\n\n\u201cThere is much more that can be done,\u201d Rhodes wrote, adding, \u201cUltimately, we believe that Congress should lift an embargo that is not to advancing the Cuban people\u2019s individual well-being and human rights, and remove onerous restrictions that aim to dictate to Americans where they can and cannot travel.\u201d\n\nThis week, Cuban Foreign Trade Minister Rodrigo Malmierca addressed the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2014making him the first senior Cuban official to do so in more than a half-century.\n\n\u201cUnder this regime, Cuba\u2019s primary export has been anti-Americanism,\u201d Quintana said. \u201cThe administration\u2019s unilateral concessions to Havana have strengthened the regime and eased what had been building pressure to transition to democracy. Since the concessions were announced, the regime has stepped up its repression of democratic activists and sparked a huge increase in the number of Cuban refugees entering the U.S.\u201d\n\nShe added:", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Presidents are not supposed to be in support of military dictatorships.\"", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"Presidents are not supposed to be in support of military dictatorships.\"", "title": "What Will Obama Achieve With His Cuba Visit?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160218_ObamaCuba_Jessen.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-18T15:04:01+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1KsAjTm"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"Presidents are not supposed to be in support of military dictatorships.\"", "title": "What Will Obama Achieve With His Cuba Visit?", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160218_ObamaCuba_Jessen.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": "president", "published_time": "2016-02-18T14:22:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-18T15:04:01+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, Cuba, Castro, Havana, trip, Michelle Obama, diplomatic relations, international, military dictatorship, Calvin Coolidge"}, "article_summary": "The last sitting U.S. president to visit Cuba was Calvin Coolidge in 1928.\nPresident Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will be making a historic trip to Havana, Cuba, March 21-22, the White House announced Thursday.\n\u2014 President Obama (@POTUS) February 18, 2016Rhodes wrote:Last summer, we restored diplomatic relations and Secretary of State John Kerry traveled to Cuba to raise the American flag over our Embassy.\n\u2014 President Obama (@POTUS) February 18, 2016\u201cPresident Obama\u2019s decision to visit Cuba reveals the real goal of his Cuba policy: legitimization of the Castro regime,\u201d Ana Quintana, a policy analyst in Latin America and the Western Hemisphere at The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy, said in a statement.\nNext month, I'll travel to Cuba to advance our progress and efforts that can improve the lives of the Cuban people."}
