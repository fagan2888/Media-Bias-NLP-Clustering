Officers are investigating a second deadly pile-up along Interstate-10 related to an earlier wrong-way driver accident near Quartzsite, the Arizona Department of Public Safety said.

I-10 was closed eastbound at milepost 44 for most of Saturday morning while officers conducted their investigation. It re-opened at around 11:30 a.m.

Shortly after 5:30 a.m., a semi-trailer truck failed to slow for traffic congestion tied to an earlier four-car collision that killed a woman and injured several others.

The big rig then rear-ended another semi along eastbound I-10 at milepost 44, west of Quartzsite , DPS said. Two other commercial semi-trailer trucks were also rear-ended due to the initial impact.

The first semi burst into flames, killing the driver, DPS officers said.

Investigators said it’s not clear why the driver failed to slow down for traffic congestion. Fatigue has not been ruled out, DPS said.
