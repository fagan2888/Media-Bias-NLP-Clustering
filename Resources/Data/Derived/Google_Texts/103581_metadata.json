Animal health powerhouse Zoetis (NYSE:ZTS) fell 5% today, after it reported fourth-quarter results that came in slightly ahead of analyst estimates, at $0.36 per share versus an estimate of $0.34. However, the news that had shares falling was the company's guidance for 2014. With a midpoint of $1.51 in per-share 2014 earnings, guidance was 10 cents lighter per share than analysts had hoped, and the stock took a haircut as a result.\n\nSmall-cap active pharmaceutical ingredient maker Cambrex (NYSE:CBM) is today's other loser. While there was no further clarity regarding rumors over the a possible deal for Cambrex regarding the hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, the more important factor today was that the company released guidance for 2014, which, like Zoetis, was also lower than estimates.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "18:46", "date": "2014-02-11T23:46:00Z", "description": "Here's what was behind Zoetis' and Cambrex's market falls today.", "ResponsiveALP": "1Ses_control-21_control_100", "author": "Dave Williamson", "promo": "Here's what was behind Zoetis' and Cambrex's market falls today.", "twitter": {"site": "@themotleyfool", "description": "Here's what was behind Zoetis' and Cambrex's market falls today.", "title": "Why Zoetis Inc. and Cambrex Corporation Were Today's 2 Big Losers --  The Motley Fool"}, "pitch": 387, "og": {"site_name": "The Motley Fool", "description": "Here's what was behind Zoetis' and Cambrex's market falls today.", "title": "Why Zoetis Inc. and Cambrex Corporation Were Today's 2 Big Losers --  The Motley Fool", "url": "http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/02/11/why-zoetis-inc-and-cambrex-corporation-were-todays.aspx", "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Ffool%2Ftmf-logo.png&h=630&w=1200&op=resize", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 50808187550, "page_id": 7240312795, "app_id": 50808187550}, "bureau": "usmf-health-care", "STORY_UID": "54becfac-9375-11e3-a59e-0050569d4be0", "headline": "Why Zoetis Inc. and Cambrex Corporation Were Today's 2 Big Losers", "msvalidate.01": "8D40D58712924715BAA79D135A6C8DDA", "gsa_date": "2014 02 11", "tickers": "ZTS,CBM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe06b0\"", "article_summary": "In this segment, David takes a look at two of the day's losers from the world of health care.\nIn this video from Tuesday's Market Checkup, Motley Fool health-care analyst David Williamson takes investors through the biggest investing stories in the health care space today.\nAnimal health powerhouse Zoetis (NYSE:ZTS) fell 5% today, after it reported fourth-quarter results that came in slightly ahead of analyst estimates, at $0.36 per share versus an estimate of $0.34.\nSmall-cap active pharmaceutical ingredient maker Cambrex (NYSE:CBM) is today's other loser.\nHowever, the news that had shares falling was the company's guidance for 2014."}
