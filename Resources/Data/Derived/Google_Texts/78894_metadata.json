And there\u2019s only one economically sound answer: Congress must raise the debt ceiling, end the sequester, put more people to work, and increase our investment in education and infrastructure.\n\nHere are the three reasons why Republican deficit hawks are wrong. (Please watch and share our attached video.)\n\nFIRST: Deficit and debt numbers are meaningless on their own. They have to be viewed as a percent of the national economy.\n\nThat ratio is critical. As long as the yearly deficit continues to drop as a percent of the national economy, as it\u2019s been doing for several years now, we can more easily pay what we owe.\n\nSECOND: America needs to run larger deficits when lots of people are unemployed or underemployed \u2013 as they still are today, when millions remain too discouraged to look for jobs and millions more are in part-time jobs and need full-time work.\n\nAs we\u2019ve known for years \u2013 in every economic downturn and in every struggling recovery \u2013 more government spending helps create jobs \u2013 teachers, fire fighters, police officers, social workers, people to rebuild roads and bridges and parks. And the people in these jobs create far more jobs when they spend their paychecks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Deficit and debt numbers are meaningless on their own  VIDEO", "title": "Robert Reich: The three reasons Republican deficit hawks are wrong", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Deficit and debt numbers are meaningless on their own  VIDEO", "title": "Robert Reich: The three reasons Republican deficit hawks are wrong", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/18/robert_reich_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2010/09/robert_reich_explains_why_the_great_recession_wont_end_soon.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Deficit and debt numbers are meaningless on their own  VIDEO", "title": "Robert Reich: The three reasons Republican deficit hawks are wrong", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2010/09/robert_reich_explains_why_the_great_recession_wont_end_soon.jpg", "creator": "@rbreich", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Robert Reich", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Austerity, Deficit, Robert Reich, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Austerity, Deficit, Robert Reich, Video, Business News, Politics NewsThis originally appeared on Robert Reich's blogCongress is heading into another big brawl over the federal budget deficit, the national debt, and the debt ceiling.\nAnd the people in these jobs create far more jobs when they spend their paychecks.\nHere are the three reasons why Republican deficit hawks are wrong.\nAs long as the yearly deficit continues to drop as a percent of the national economy, as it\u2019s been doing for several years now, we can more easily pay what we owe.\nFIRST: Deficit and debt numbers are meaningless on their own."}
