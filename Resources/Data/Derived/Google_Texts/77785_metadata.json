Here are some of the key findings:\n\nHealthcare.gov and seven state exchanges offered tools that allowed customers to get a general idea of what their healthcare will cost, but these tools only provide rough estimates because they don't take specific medication costs or patient needs into account.\n\nHealthcare.gov and five state exchanges provide directories that allow consumers to see which plans include their providers, but the directories only identify which providers are in-network, and not the level of cost-sharing consumers will experience.\n\nFour state exchanges provide information on the quality of plans.\n\nHealthcare.gov and all but two state exchanges offer the option to view their entire websites in Spanish, and California and Massachusetts offer their websites in an array of languages.\n\nTo further enhance their websites, the report recommends that the exchanges: offer cost calculators that include consumers' expected use of healthcare, adopt designs that tell consumers when they are eligible for cost-sharing reductions, keep plan information as up-to-date as possible, place quality information in a prominent location on the website, and provide additional features to help people who understand limited English.\n\n\"It is critical that consumers remain at the center of efforts to improve these websites,\" the researchers wrote. \"These efforts will help the marketplace deliver on one of its core missions: helping consumers compare coverage options and identify the plan that best meets their and their families' needs.\"\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here is the report (.pdf)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n3 ways to improve consumer experience on health insurance exchanges\n\nHealth insurance marketplaces improve consumer-friendly tools\n\nLower income marketplace enrollees still have trouble with healthcare costs", "article_metadata": {"description": "It is becoming easier for consumers to evaluate Affordable Care Act health insurance plans online, though more could be done to enhance the\u00a0user experience\u00a0on the exchange websites, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0from the National Partnership for Women & Families.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "It is becoming easier for consumers to evaluate Affordable Care Act health insurance plans online, though more could be done to enhance the\u00a0user experience\u00a0on the exchange websites, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0from the National Partnership for Women & Families.", "title": "User experience better on exchange websites, but more improvement needed", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/user-experience-better-exchange-websites-more-improvement-needed/2016-05-12", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "ACA marketplace,consumer tools,Health Information Technology,Health Insurance Exchanges,health literacy,health tools,Marketing & Consumer Engagement,state exchanges", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Health Information Technology,Health Insurance Exchanges,Marketing & Consumer Engagement"}, "article_summary": "Healthcare.gov and all but two state exchanges offer the option to view their entire websites in Spanish, and California and Massachusetts offer their websites in an array of languages.\nFour state exchanges provide information on the quality of plans.\nHealthcare.gov and five state exchanges provide directories that allow consumers to see which plans include their providers, but the directories only identify which providers are in-network, and not the level of cost-sharing consumers will experience.\n\"It is critical that consumers remain at the center of efforts to improve these websites,\" the researchers wrote.\nIt is becoming easier for consumers to evaluate Affordable Care Act health insurance plans online, though more could be done to enhance the user experience on the exchange websites, according to a report from the National Partnership for Women & Families."}
