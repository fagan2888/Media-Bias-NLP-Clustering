This term usually is applied to persons of importance. The implication in Al Pacino\u2019s reply is that he doesn\u2019t want or need to be famous or important. M.A. Russo\n\nFresh Meadows: The reference to Al Pacino\u2019s statement \u201cAnother pezzonovanta\u201d in \u201cThe Godfather\u201d refers to soneone who weighs 90 kilos or about 200 lbs, thus a \u201cheavyweight\u201d or a big shot. Hope that clears things up. Richard Del Favero\n\nDeer Park. L.I.: \u201cPezzonovante\u201d originally meant: the biggest firecracker (mortar) fired at a firework show, later on became a mafia word meaning a powerful mafioso, a big shot, a politician who has power and does favors, also a person that is very powerful in his profession or activity. Andrew Belloisi\n\nWar and security\n\nBrooklyn: To Voicer Dawn R. LaMadeleine, who has a typically liberal and selective take on recent history: Were you absent the day that Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons to murder thousands of civilians (including children)? While we\u2019re at it, perhaps you can explain, to those of us not so enlightened, how America has benefited from the so-called \u201cwars for oil,\u201d which are so much a part of the liberal mantra? Kenneth Klipp\n\nNot our fight\n\nGarfield, N.J.: The war in Syria is a bad idea, an unjust war, a waste of our resources, and none of our business. Yet we somehow may end up getting involved. Unbelievable! David Reniewich\n\nTheir neighborhood\n\nRichmond Hill: Let Iran, Iraq and Egypt deal with Syria\u2019s chemical warfare. Thomas D. & Anna E. Esposito\n\nTheir problem\n\nStockholm, N.J.: If this gassing of innocent people happened in either China or Russia, would we be contemplating bombing those countries? There will never be peace in the Arab world, so can\u2019t the U.S.A. for once just take care of business here at home and let all the civil wars in these Third World countries be just that? Gino Nuzzo\n\nDance to the music\n\nBrooklyn: To Voicer Judith Durah: What you and the rest of the American public are calling twerking is what we in the West Indian community call \u201cWining,\u201d a cultural tradition. This is how we dance to our form of music, whether it be Calypso or Reggae, so what you saw the masqueraders doing was not taken from Miley Cyrus or anybody else. They took it from us the way they take everything else and try to make it their own. Pamela O\u2019Connor\n\nNyuk, nyuk, nyuk\n\nMatawan, N.J.: It surprises me that Gov. Cuomo does not want to endorse a mayoral candidate, but I do understand his decision. He\u2019s probably thinking, \u201cWho do I pick, Moe, Larry or Curly?\u201d Angelo F. Grillo\n\nReal issues ignored\n\nStaten Island: Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to hear the mayoral candidates talk about property taxes that have gone up every year for the past 12 years, ridiculously high water bills and out of control electric rates? And what about the skyrocketing rents people are faced with every month? I haven\u2019t heard a word from any of them about any of these problems that we are up against every month. I wish they would address these important issues that affect all of us. Phyllis O\u2019Callaghan\n\nNo more political mail\n\nBrooklyn: I don\u2019t know who Alan Maisel is. I don\u2019t care who he is or what he\u2019s running for. All I wish is that I\u2019d stop receiving mail from him asking for his vote. In a week alone I received six postcards. Utterly ridiculous and a waste of money. Heidi Lystad\n\nRobbery protection\n\nMiddle Village: The Cross County Federal Saving Bank policy banning hoodies, hats and sunglasses was in response to several robberies, one of which took place in my branch in Middle Village. Since then, a major renovation has taken place at this branch. The entrance has been moved and so have the teller stations. Upon entering the bank, you cannot see the tellers. A robbery could be in progress and you would walk right into it. I questioned the new design on more then one occasion and was told I would know by the expression on the faces of the officers that something was awry. If Cross County Federal Bank wants to ensure the safety of its employees and customers, an unobstructed view of the premises would be advisable and most appreciated by me. Linda Pettorsson\n\nA sure thing\n\nAstoria: Re your Sept. 4 editorial \u201cAqueduct finish line\u201d: Having a casino at the track was to raise the purses so more horsemen would come. Aqueduct has not had needed repairs done because the politicians want the property. The idea to build affordable housing is laughable, because once that land is taken, the the seniors and the poor would soon be forgotten. You are right in asking about the Lottery money. But where is the parking meter money? Where is the bridge toll money? It never has gone to education. Look at OTB, when it began it was also for education. You want to free up the property to generate more revenue for the city, which takes enough from us all already. Cynthia Capurso\n\nBack to school\n\nBayonne: I keep reading about test scores and how schools are letting our children down. Here\u2019s what I see. When there were not enough teachers, they allowed people to teach using the alternative route. There is no longer a shortage of teachers; many are being laid off. My son has had his degree for 10 years and all he can get is a permanent sub job, which took eight years to obtain. Meanwhile, people without a license who have never taught or been in a classroom are being hired. I think the alternative route has served its purpose. It\u2019s time to get people in the classroom who chose teaching as a profession, did student teaching and wanted to make a difference from the beginning. Not someone who took the job since he could not get a job in his own profession. Patricia Cummings\n\nTaking a break\n\nStaten Island: I noticed for a long time that Darby Conley of \u201cGet Fuzzy\u201d is always going on vacation. It must be very exhausting, beyond human endurance, work to draw and write a comic strip. As far as I\u2019m concerned, he can stay on vacation because \u201cGet Fuzzy\u201d is stupid. Please bring back \u201cCurtis.\u201d Pedro Moure\n\nThe other side at Walmart\n\nSecaucus: In response to Thursday\u2019s anti-Walmart protest in New York City, I would like readers to know that the claims made by the protesters are far different than what I have experienced in my years with the company. As someone who never had the opportunity to get a college degree, I was concerned that my career would suffer. But I have thrived thanks to the support of Walmart. I joined Walmart more than 10 years ago and realized immediately that I had come to the right place. Starting as a sales associate, I worked my way up on the sales floor to sporting goods and then into store planning. For the past three years, I have been a co-manager, currently at the Secaucus location. By encouraging mobility, Walmart has fostered an environment that pushed me to advance and grow. My story isn\u2019t unique \u2014 thousands of others have had the same experience. I hope people will keep this in mind as they read and hear comments by Walmart\u2019s critics. Joshua Robertson\n\nThe fracking debate\n\nOssining, N.Y.: Congratulations on your Sept. 3 editorial, \u201cA tutor for Cuomo,\u201d dealing with one of the most important issues of our time \u2014 fracking to gain energy independence \u2014 and the wisdom of Energy Secretary Moniz, one of President Obama\u2019s wisest appointments. Moniz, along with Interior Secretary Sally Jewell and EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, make a terrific team to pursue an energy policy that could well save our country. Now it\u2019s time for you to cover and interview the other side, i.e., five of the nation\u2019s most knowledgeable and prominent anti-frackers: Lady Gaga, Yoko Ono, Mark Ruffalo, the Academy Awards Nominating Committee and Ian Urbina, fracking reporter for The New York Times. Let\u2019s see what they come up with. William Jaenike\n\nSecond-class treatment\n\nFishkill, N.Y.: Congratulations to Voicer Susan Seidenberg on being a three year cancer survivor. The sad part is that Obamacare is just for the general public, not for the members of Congress, the President or their families. They get to keep the plan that they currently have.
