Collectively, they could be a financial and administrative avalanche that may overwhelm employers.\n\n\u201cThe restaurant and hospitality industry in particular has been hit very hard\u201d by the new regulations, said Shari Herrle, vice president and director of compliance at Henderson Brothers insurance agency, Downtown.\n\nBusinesses had only recently come to grips with their responsibilities for offering health coverage under the Affordable Care Act, she said. Now they also need to figure out how they will pay overtime wages for assistant managers, \u201cthe people who help keep the business going\u201d but had previously been salaried. And that\u2019s on top of a possible minimum wage increase and mandatory paid sick days.\n\n\u201cOur clients are trying to do the right thing for their employees. It just makes it very, very difficult,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a busy and competitive business environment, though, it\u2019s unclear whether the coming changes have registered with employers.\n\n\u201cIf you were to poll the average business owner on all of these and ask them if they are real, they would probably check one or two and put question marks next to the rest,\u201d said Marilyn Landis, founder of Basic Business Concepts on the North Side and former chair of the National Small Business Association.\n\n\u201cThey find out about things when they get a penalty, get a warning notice or literally trip over it,\u201d she said.\n\nAs district director of the Pittsburgh Small Business Administration, Kelly Hunt provides information to help business owners comply with new regulations and \u201cto help small businesses adjust and make sure they can still grow and succeed.\u201d\n\nSo far, she\u2019s not been hearing from small business owners about the changes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like people are forgetting about it right now, before they start seeing it and have to comply,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople know it\u2019s out there, but I think they hope that it keeps getting pushed off. I doubt that\u2019s going to happen.\n\n\u201cThis is something that small businesses definitely need to be planning for. You need to take this under consideration. It is going to affect your bottom line in some way.\u201d\n\nPeter Fleming, partner and CPA at Wilke & Associates in Carnegie, said he can foresee many businesses getting hit with all four obligations, not that they\u2019re prepared or even considering the implications yet.\n\n\u201cA lot of it is because they don\u2019t want to deal with it. There\u2019s so much complexity, they just don\u2019t want to take the time to wrap their arms around it until they have to,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re in a crouched, defensive position because they know some things are coming that are not good, but they don\u2019t want to focus on it.\u201d\n\nThe new regulations have followed different timetables and have taken different paths, so their near-simultaneous arrival may explain why businesses seem to be slow to react.\n\nProvisions under the Affordable Care Act that penalize employers who don\u2019t offer a health plan were under discussion more than five years ago; the U.S. Department of Labor announced just last month a proposed rule to expand eligibility for overtime pay for workers earning as little as $23,660 a year; the Pennsylvania Legislature is considering a proposal to raise the minimum hourly wage to $10.10; and the paid sick leave legislation was approved by Pittsburgh City Council on Aug. 3.\n\nTaken together, said Mrs. Herrle, they represent \u201ca perfect storm for retail and hospitality businesses in the city.\u201d\n\nRaymond Vargo, director of the University of Pittsburgh Small Business Development Center, said business owners are busy enough with the day-to-day logistics of staying in business and trying to make a profit to keep track of all the regulations, proposed or passed.\n\n\u201cWhen a business owner wakes up in the middle of the night, they\u2019re wondering \u2018What customers am I going to get tomorrow and where are they coming from?\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAny time the government puts an additional burden on the small business owner, financially, administratively, whatever, that is a true cost to that business and a small business does not have the economy of scale that that can be absorbed a little bit easier.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to be successful in a business environment now and these additional burdens make it more difficult.\u201d\n\nSteve Twedt: stwedt@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1963.\n\nCorrection, posted Aug. 28, 2015: In an earlier version of this story, the name of the business founded by Marilyn Landis was misstated.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For some, these new regulations could be a financial and administrative avalanche that may overwhelm employers.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "Small business owners setting up a budget for the next 12 months should prepare to see a few lines added to the ledger\u2019s debit side: One for the possible increase in the minimum wage, another to cover the newly-expanded eligibility for overtime pay, and yet another for the 2016 play-or-pay health coverage obligation for firms with at least 50 employees.
