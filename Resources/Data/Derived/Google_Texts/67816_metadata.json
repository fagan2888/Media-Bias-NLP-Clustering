Everything\u2019s not political. It is an election year.\u201d\n\nRichard says the legislature has to deal with social issues some time.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the overreach of the fed at some times, and then we\u2019ve got this immigration issue. We\u2019ve got this Medicaid that is expanding by itself. I mean, we can\u2019t continue the growth of an extra $100,000 every couple of years just because Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, is throwing people off and they can\u2019t afford that kind of insurance,\u201d said Richard.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve still got to take care of the veterans, you\u2019ve got to take care of the older population and that\u2019s part of it. You can\u2019t deny that there\u2019s a social aspect to \u2026 that\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re in the majority,\u201d said Richard.\n\nBoth say key issues in the final weeks include ethics reform and finishing the budget.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Missourinet", "description": "The Republican leaders of the state House and Senate reject the assessment that their focus is on social issues that will drive conservative voters to the polls in November.
