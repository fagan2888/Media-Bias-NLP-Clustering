Many of the clinics merged over the years (others are thriving independently) to form Lifelong Medical Care, which now serves more than 50,000 clients a year in three counties. Many of those dignitaries had worked in the health care reform movement.\n\n\u201cWell before the Affordable Care Act was a reality, Berkeley has been seriously engaged, Berkeley has been doing its best, to actualize that health care is a right and is accessible to everyone,\u201d said Skinner, who then jokingly referred to the people in the room \u2014 once radicals \u2013 as \u201cthe establishment.\u201d\n\nThe new $13 million, three-story clinic at 2031 Sixth St. is designed to treat the whole patient, not just his or her specific ailment. On each floor there is a \u201cpod\u201d (really an elongated office) with long counters, multiple computers and chairs. Exam rooms are right near by. The ideas is that all the people who treat patients are in close contact so they can easily confer on the best treatment. For example, if a doctor determines a patient has diabetes, she can immediately put that client in touch with the person who runs diabetes or healthy cooking classes. If the patient needs a blood test, the doctor can send him to the blood lab \u2013 right down hall.\n\nThe new clinic is also completely computerized, which should assist in patient care. For example, the scales and blood pressure cuffs are connected to the computer system, so a patient\u2019s vital signs are automatically fed online. While Lifelong staff took the blood pressure of 100% of the patients previously, the information only got recorded about 80% of the time, according to Dr. Ron Adler, who serves on the board. Now all that information will be available for perusal.\n\nThe new clinic is also decorated with art, which is one more way Lifelong provides a full experience to patients. The art is curated by three volunteers and changed regularly. Kaiser Permanente Foundation donated the mural the wraps up and around the main staircase. It is dedicated to Dr. Henrik L. Blum, an emeritus professor of health administration at UC Berkeley and a pioneer in health care reform. He served on Lifelong\u2019s board for many years.\n\nRafael Baca and his wife and daughter spoke at the dedication ceremony and thanked Lifelong staff for improving their lives. Baca said he had diabetes and \u201ceverybody here is helping us.\u201d\n\nRoberta Brooks, who chaired the capital campaign and was a former aide to Lee, reminded the crowd that Lifelong is not well known among Berkeley\u2019s affluent population. They don\u2019t really know where the poor get their health care. She urged those in the audience to spread the word about Lifelong, as it will need operating funds to run the new clinic.\n\nBerkeleyside was the event\u2019s media sponsor.\n\nSee more photos of the Lifelong Medical Care grand opening celebration.\n\nRelated:\n\nLifeLong Medical Care celebrates renovated Berkeley space (02.28.14)\n\nLifelong Medical Care gets $1.1 million federal grant (05.29.12)\n\nLifelong Medical Care: helping the community for 36 years (03.05.12)\n\nBerkeleyside publishes many articles every day.
