Rats: Cannibal-rat-carrying ghost ship is likely a hoax

The ship isn’t — the Lyubov Orlova actually exists, and actually did get lost at sea after a tow line broke as the ship headed to the scrapyard. It may not have sunk, either, although that’s still up for debate. But no one knows where it is, or whether it’s headed to the British isles or to Timbuktu (which would be a neat trick, admittedly, since Timbuktu is landlocked). But the cannibal rats that just might be lurking offshore are the product of one part speculation and nine parts imagination:

A science writer for NBC says: “It made for the tastiest click bait since ‘Sharknado!’ But alas, there’s not much behind this rat tale.”

Rats! However, the number of ghost ships floating in the ocean does give one pause:

Quartz reports an average of 146 ships were lost each year between 2001 and 2010. Even with 42 percent of those ships sinking, there are still a lot of ghost ships haunting the waters.

And, of course, cannibal rats. But you didn’t hear that from me.
