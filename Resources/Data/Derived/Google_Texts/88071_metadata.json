(AP) - Leaders of the National Rifle Association on Saturday cited the new Republican majority in the U.S. Senate as evidence of the group\u2019s political clout, but warned of looming gun-control efforts in the final years of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\nWayne LaPierre, the NRA\u2019s executive vice president and CEO, in his members\u2019 meeting speech called on Congress to enact a law allowing people with handgun carry permits to be allowed to be armed anywhere in the country, arguing that nobody \u201cshould be forced to face evil with bare hands.\u201d\n\nThe motto of the NRA\u2019s annual convention this weekend is: \u201cIf they can ban one, they can ban them all.\u201d Organizers expect more than 70,000 people to visit the convention\u2019s exhibit space, meetings and musical acts in downtown Nashville.\n\nLaPierre and Chris Cox, the head of the NRA\u2019s lobbying arm, painted a bleak picture of the state of the country and the dangers to gun rights presented by the last 650 days of Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no telling how far President Obama will go to dismantle our freedoms and reshape America into an America that you and I will not even recognize,\u201d LaPierre said. \u201cAnd when he\u2019s finished he intends to go out with a coronation of Hillary Rodham Clinton.\u201d\n\nClinton is expected to announce the launch of her bid for the Democratic nomination for president on Sunday.\n\nCox said Clinton would make Obama \u201clook like an amateur\u201d when it comes to gun control.\n\n\u201cThink about it: Hillary Clinton as president of the United States until 2025,\u201d Cox said. \u201cScared yet?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a few hundred NRA protesters gathered in a park along the nearby Cumberland River. Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, criticized what she called LaPierre\u2019s \u201cfear-mongering rhetoric.\u201d\n\nThe NRA\u2019s goal, Watts said, is: \u201cGuns for anyone, anywhere, anytime - no questions asked.\u201d\n\nBack at the NRA meeting, the group\u2019s president, Jim Porter, criticized politicians and the media on gun rights, a common refrain throughout speeches at the convention.\n\n\u201cThey think that they\u2019re better and smarter than we are, as if they\u2019re more sophisticated and intellectually evolved than we are,\u201d Porter said.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to those elitists, looking down their noses and telling us how to live, it\u2019s time they got the message loud and clear,\u201d he said. \u201cYou elitists live however your want, but when it comes to us, get your hands off our freedom and leave us the hell alone.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the NRA hosted a series of speeches from potential Republican presidential candidates, including former Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida; Govs. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana; Sen. Ted Cruz and former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas; former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas; Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina; and neurosurgeon Ben Carson.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s Cox told members on Saturday that the group has a multi-pronged approach to opposing gun-control advocates.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll fight you in the courts, we\u2019ll fight you in the legislatures and we\u2019ll fight you on Election Day,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Leaders of the National Rifle Association on Saturday cited the new Republican majority in the U.S. Senate as evidence of the group's political clout, but warned of looming gun-control efforts in the final years of Barack Obama's presidency.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Leaders of the National Rifle Association on Saturday cited the new Republican majority in the U.S. Senate as evidence of the group\u2019s political clout, but warned of looming gun-control efforts in the final years of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency.", "title": "NRA leaders warn members of looming gun-control efforts", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/11/nra-leaders-warn-members-of-looming-gun-control-ef/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/11/da13a56d44e46110730f6a706700664a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/11/da13a56d44e46110730f6a706700664a.jpg", "description": "Leaders of the National Rifle Association on Saturday cited the new Republican majority in the U.S. Senate as evidence of the group's political clout, but warned of looming gun-control efforts in the", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "NRA leaders warn members of looming gun-control efforts"}, "Author": "ERIK SCHELZIG", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdefac\"", "article_summary": "The NRA\u2019s Cox told members on Saturday that the group has a multi-pronged approach to opposing gun-control advocates.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll fight you in the courts, we\u2019ll fight you in the legislatures and we\u2019ll fight you on Election Day,\u201d he said.\nCox said Clinton would make Obama \u201clook like an amateur\u201d when it comes to gun control.\n\u201cScared yet?\u201dMeanwhile, a few hundred NRA protesters gathered in a park along the nearby Cumberland River.\n\u201cThink about it: Hillary Clinton as president of the United States until 2025,\u201d Cox said."}
