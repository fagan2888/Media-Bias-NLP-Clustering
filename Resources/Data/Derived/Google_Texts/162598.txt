APAC Customer Services, Inc. appears to be on a hiring spree. Over the past few months the BPO provider has hired hundreds of employees at its call centers across the United States and in a statement released this week the company revealed it is adding 200 agents to its delivery center in Newport News, VA.

These full-time positions will provide customer support via phone, email and chat for a major healthcare client, according to the company statement.

This news comes on the heels of APAC’s announcement that it is hiring 300 people at its newly renovated service center in Mendota Heights, MN.

Thanks to “Obamacare,” the onshore call center market has been growing rapidly in the last couple of years. Because of its large clientele in the healthcare sector, APAC appears to be at the forefront of this growth.

The Bannockburn, Illinois-based company — which provides sales support and solutions, customer care, technical support, and back-office services — is also going to add 750 positions to its call center in Phoenix, AZ, through the end of this year.

Healthcare is APAC’s biggest vertical, but it is also serving several clients in other sectors, including financial services, technology, communications, business logistics, and travel & hospitality.
