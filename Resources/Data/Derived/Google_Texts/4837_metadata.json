Individuals who receive these subsidies make less than $48,000 per year, and many would struggle to afford health-insurance plans without the government\u2019s financial help. Health-policy analysts feared that, without the subsidies in place, healthy people would withdraw from the health-insurance exchanges in large numbers. That, in turn, would cause premiums to skyrocket, making insurance unaffordable to almost anyone who does not receive insurance coverage through their jobs.\n\nAt issue in the case, King v. Burwell, was whether the subsidies should go to residents of the roughly three dozen states that use the federal health-insurance exchange, in addition to those who live in states that run their own exchanges.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act survived its second major challenge at the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday. In a 6-to-3 decision, the justices ruled that the Internal Revenue Service can continue to provide health-insurance subsidies to middle-class people living in all states.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act gave states the option to either set up their own exchanges or to rely on the federal government\u2019s marketplace through Healthcare.gov. The part of the law that describes the subsidies said they should only apply to people in the exchanges \u201cestablished by the state.\u201d The plaintiffs in the King case said that clause meant the IRS was offering subsidies to residents of federal-exchange states illegally.\n\nIn the opinion of the Court, Chief Justice John Roberts dismissed the idea that the fate of the entire Obamacare law should hinge on such a technicality.\n\n\u201cIn petitioners\u2019 view, Congress made the viability of the entire Affordable Care Act turn on the ultimate ancillary provision: a sub sub-sub section of the Tax Code,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe doubt that is what Congress meant to do.\u201d\n\nMany patient advocates cheered the decision. \u201cIt means that millions of people with serious health conditions such as cancer will continue to have access to essential treatment and care, and millions of others at risk for disease will be able to afford preventive screenings and tests that could save their lives,\u201d said Chris Hansen, president of the American Cancer Society\u2019s advocacy arm, in a statement.\n\nJustices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito dissented, writing, \u201cWords no longer have meaning if an Exchange that is not established by a State is \u2018established by the State.\u2019\u201d\n\nRoberts concludes by saying that the Court is attempting to respect what Congress hoped to accomplish in passing the law: \u201cCongress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them.\u201d\n\nThere are still a few, more minor, legal challenges to Obamacare remaining. But at least for now, the law lives to see another day.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. Supreme Court upholds Obamacare in a 6-3 decision, deferring to the intent of legislators.", "author": "Olga Khazan", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The justices uphold Obamacare in a 6-3 decision, deferring to the intent of Congress.", "title": "The Supreme Court's Surprise Ruling Saves Obamacare", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/06/31Moon/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/we-doubt-that-this-is-what-congress-meant-to-do/396839/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/olgakhazan"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The Affordable Care Act survived its second major challenge at the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday.\nIn the opinion of the Court, Chief Justice John Roberts dismissed the idea that the fate of the entire Obamacare law should hinge on such a technicality.\nThe Affordable Care Act gave states the option to either set up their own exchanges or to rely on the federal government\u2019s marketplace through Healthcare.gov.\nIn a 6-to-3 decision, the justices ruled that the Internal Revenue Service can continue to provide health-insurance subsidies to middle-class people living in all states.\nHealth-policy analysts feared that, without the subsidies in place, healthy people would withdraw from the health-insurance exchanges in large numbers."}
