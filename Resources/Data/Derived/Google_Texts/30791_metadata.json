However, that is not possible under Colorado law without proof of a live birth.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Boulder District Attorney Stan Garnett\n\nThe Boulder DA was referring of course to the nightmarish case in Longmont in which a pregnant woman, Michelle Wilkins, was attacked and left for dead \u2014 and her baby removed and taken away.\n\nThe baby did not survive and there is no evidence, according to the coroner, that she ever took a breath \u2014 i.e., that she ever qualified as a person under Colorado law. And so a homicide charge was out of the question, just as Garnett said.\n\nBut there is something obviously very wrong with that outcome. It was a homicide, and everyone knows it. Wilkins\u2019 daughter, Aurora, was 34 weeks post-conception, with about a 98 percent chance of survival outside the womb given proper medical care, according to a neonatologist quoted in The Denver Post. She is dead because she was murdered, and the law ought to account for it.\n\nInstead, the law limits Garnett to a charge of \u201cunlawful termination of a pregnancy in the first degree,\u201d with a maximum penalty of 32 years in prison.\n\nLawmakers should address this defect. To that end, Senate President Bill Cadman, R-Colorado Springs, has promised a fetal homicide bill within days. However, passing it is likely to be difficult unless both pro-choice and pro-life lawmakers are willing to bend.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got two victims of an incredibly violent act and, under Colorado law, you basically can seek convictions related to only one victim,\u201d Cadman told me. \u201cWhere is the murder charge for Aurora Wilkins?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just saying if you attack a woman and she\u2019s pregnant and you can be charged with her attack, then you can be charged with the attack on her infant,\u201d he added.\n\nPro-choice lawmakers historically have resisted such ideas for fear of granting anything that smacks of full human status to an unborn child and finding themselves on a slippery slope. But Cadman says the bill \u201cis exclusively for a criminal act. There will be a provision that will clearly state that this does not apply to a woman\u2019s self-determination [regarding abortion, obviously] or her health care.\u201d\n\nSuch a statute would not remotely jeopardize abortion rights, but it would empower mothers who wish to bring their baby to term with the ability to seek full justice.\n\nOf course, the exemption applying to legal termination of a pregnancy would have to be unambiguous or the bill will be killed by Democrats, who control the House and the governor\u2019s office. And this is where pro-life lawmakers must give.\n\nFour years ago, anti-abortion forces rallied against a bill expanding protection for unborn babies killed by criminal acts that ended a pregnancy. A similar bill did pass in 2013, but only because Democrats were entirely in charge \u2014 and that bill, of course, didn\u2019t go far enough.\n\nWill pro-life lawmakers bow to the reality that they can\u2019t pass a fetal homicide bill without language that addresses Democrats\u2019 fears of a slippery slope?\n\nGarnett dropped a load of charges on the alleged assailant in baby Aurora\u2019s case. If a judge imposes several sentences consecutively, the penalty could be 100 years.\n\nBut that won\u2019t always be true when an unborn baby is murdered. And it\u2019s time to rectify this glaring gap in our law.\n\nE-mail Vincent Carroll at vcarroll@denverpost.com.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Carroll: Death of Michelle Wilkins\u2019 baby was murder in all but the law", "title": "Carroll: Death of Michelle Wilkins\u2019 baby was murder in all but the law", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/03/carroll-death-of-michelle-wilkins-baby-was-murder-in-all-but-the-law/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150403__20150405_Z00_POOP05C_CARROLLp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150403__20150405_Z00_POOP05C_CARROLLp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-03T15:46:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T11:17:35+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda1fe\"", "article_summary": "To that end, Senate President Bill Cadman, R-Colorado Springs, has promised a fetal homicide bill within days.\nAnd so a homicide charge was out of the question, just as Garnett said.\nHowever, passing it is likely to be difficult unless both pro-choice and pro-life lawmakers are willing to bend.\nBut that won\u2019t always be true when an unborn baby is murdered.\nAnd this is where pro-life lawmakers must give."}
