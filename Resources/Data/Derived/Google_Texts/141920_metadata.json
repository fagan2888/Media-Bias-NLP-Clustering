(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nRepublican presidential candidates often promise that once they\u2019re made president, they will do away with President Obama\u2019s executive action to show leniency towards some undocumented immigrants. But they may want to take note that many of their constituents disagree. That\u2019s according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, which found that a majority of Americans support Obama\u2019s plan to allow certain undocumented immigrants to stay in the country legally.\n\nThe poll found that 61 percent of Americans \u2014 including 42 percent of Republicans \u2014 would support an immigration plan granting temporary deportation reprieve and work authorization for undocumented immigrants, particularly \u201cwhen it is described in general terms without using Obama\u2019s name,\u201d Reuters reported. When the same plan was identified as an executive action taken by Obama, support fell 7 percent, with only 31 percent of Republicans supporting such a plan. The inverse was true for Democrats, whose support for the plan went up 2 percent once Obama\u2019s name was attached to it.\n\nThat two-part plan, formally announced in November 2014 as the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Legal Residents (DAPA) and a similar program targeted at younger undocumented immigrants, was Obama\u2019s signature executive action on immigration during a time of congressional inaction on a permanent bill. DAPA and its sister program built upon a previous 2012 initiative, known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, to extend similar benefits for so-called DREAMers who came to the country as children.\n\nBut soon after Obama announced the DAPA program, a group of Republican-led states and lawmakers filed suit to challenge the president\u2019s authority to take action for upwards of four million immigrants. A Texas judge issued an injunction last year, blocking the government from implementing the DAPA and the updated DACA program. The Supreme Court recently decided to take up the case, with a decision likely set for June.\n\nThe online poll of 1,200 respondents was taken in the week following the Supreme Court decision.\n\nIt may be unsurprising that support dropped when the plan was attached to Obama\u2019s name. This partisan divide was observed last year when a similar Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) survey found that 76 percent of respondents, including 67 percent of Republicans, support the specifics of Obama\u2019s executive action when it\u2019s not linked to his name. With Obama\u2019s name attached, however, support dropped to 51 percent. (Similarly, the \u201cObama Effect\u201d has also been observed in health care policy, with polls showing that more Americans oppose the Affordable Care Act when it\u2019s linked to his name.)\n\nAlthough poll after poll indicates Republicans broadly support immigration legislation that would provide some pathway for undocumented immigrants to contribute more to American society, many Republican candidates are still insistent about doing away with Obama\u2019s executive action.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said in November 2015 that he would eventually let the DACA program end. When questioned about what he would do with the DACA program, Donald Trump broadly said that undocumented immigrants \u201chave to go.\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) recently told a DACA recipient that he would deport people like her, building on a previous statement about making it a \u201ctop priority\u201d to end the initiatives. And former Florida Governor Jeb Bush (R) called the initiatives \u201cunconstitutional\u201d in June 2015 and threatened to undo the programs in April 2015.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Support fell when the initiatives were attached to President Obama's name.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Support fell when the initiatives were attached to President Obama's name.", "title": "Candidates Vowing To End Obama\u2019s Immigration Plan May Want To Ask What Their Constituents Think", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/immigration/2016/01/28/3743697/americans-support-obama-executive-action-deferred-action/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/28100619/AP_381943399608-600x315.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Support fell when the initiatives were attached to President Obama's name.", "creator": "@EstherYuHsiLee", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/28100619/AP_381943399608-321x214.jpg", "title": "Candidates Vowing To End Obama\u2019s Immigration Plan May Want To Ask What Their Constituents Think", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-immigration", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/28100619/AP_381943399608-540x303.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/28100619/AP_381943399608-99x66.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-28T12:28:35+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/estheryuhsilee"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)Republican presidential candidates often promise that once they\u2019re made president, they will do away with President Obama\u2019s executive action to show leniency towards some undocumented immigrants.\nThat\u2019s according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, which found that a majority of Americans support Obama\u2019s plan to allow certain undocumented immigrants to stay in the country legally.\nWhen the same plan was identified as an executive action taken by Obama, support fell 7 percent, with only 31 percent of Republicans supporting such a plan.\nThe inverse was true for Democrats, whose support for the plan went up 2 percent once Obama\u2019s name was attached to it.\nAlthough poll after poll indicates Republicans broadly support immigration legislation that would provide some pathway for undocumented immigrants to contribute more to American society, many Republican candidates are still insistent about doing away with Obama\u2019s executive action."}
