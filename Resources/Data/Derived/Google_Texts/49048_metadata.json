If those states hadn\u2019t gotten the option to refuse this particular provision of the health law, the national uninsurance rate would be two percentage points lower, the new analysis predicts.\n\nThat would have dramatically changed the country, and provided an even clearer illustration of Obamacare\u2019s effect on the uninsured (the darker purple indicates a higher rate of uninsured residents):\n\nCREDIT: New York Times\n\nThis data is derived from a national model mapping how the law has affected uninsured individuals across the country. Last week, the New York Times analyzed those numbers to determine that, as a whole, health reform has helped make the country more equal by redistributing resources to the low-income people who were previously locked out of the insurance industry.\n\nBut, as illustrated by this follow-up investigation, those gains aren\u2019t being felt equally across states. \u201cThe uneven Medicaid expansion, largely a result of Republican politicians\u2019 dislike of the program and their concern that their states might get stuck with the costs, has limited the law\u2019s ability to cover poor Americans living in many of the poorest states in the country,\u201d the New York Times concludes.\n\nPrevious analyses of the states that have refused to expand Medicaid have found that the people being denied coverage are disproportionately likely to be low-income people of color. The anti-expansion states also had higher uninsurance rates to begin with, and they\u2019re home to people who tend to be poorer and sicker than the residents in other states.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that this week\u2019s midterm elections will start reshaping the map above. Depending on the outcome of the governors\u2019 races, six additional states \u2014 Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Maine, Wisconsin, and Alaska \u2014 may accept Medicaid coverage next year, according to a recent report from consulting firm Avalere Health. \u201cThis is a key election for the future of the Medicaid program,\u201d Avalere\u2019s CEO, Dan Mendelson, said in a statement last week.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "More than three million low-income people would currently have insurance, for one.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "More than three million low-income people would currently have insurance, for one.", "title": "How The Country Would Look If Every State Took Full Advantage Of Obamacare, In Two Maps", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/11/03/3587767/medicaid-expansion-map/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AP490117691699-1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "More than three million low-income people would currently have insurance, for one.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AP490117691699-1-321x214.jpg", "title": "How The Country Would Look If Every State Took Full Advantage Of Obamacare, In Two Maps", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AP490117691699-1.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AP490117691699-1.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-03T10:06:58+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4b5c\"", "article_summary": "If those states hadn\u2019t gotten the option to refuse this particular provision of the health law, the national uninsurance rate would be two percentage points lower, the new analysis predicts.\n\u201cThis is a key election for the future of the Medicaid program,\u201d Avalere\u2019s CEO, Dan Mendelson, said in a statement last week.\nThat\u2019s how Obamacare was originally intended to work \u2014 but in 2012, the Supreme Court ruled the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion to be optional, giving GOP-led states an opening to resist implementing the law.\nHealth How The Country Would Look If Every State Took Full Advantage Of Obamacare, In Two Maps CREDIT: AP Photo/Erik Schelzig Tennessee protesters urge their lawmakers to accept Medicaid expansionIf every state had expanded their Medicaid programs under Obamacare, more than three million people would now have health insurance, according to a large set of data from Enroll America and Civis Analytics analyzed in the New York Times.\nBut, as illustrated by this follow-up investigation, those gains aren\u2019t being felt equally across states."}
