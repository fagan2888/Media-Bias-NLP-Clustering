For those of you who missed the chance to watch the show, ABCFamily.com explains the idea behind Ravenswood.\n\n\u201cThis new drama series centers on a town, not far from Rosewood, PA (the home base of Pretty Little Liars), which has suffered under a deadly curse for generations. Five strangers suddenly find themselves connected by this fatal curse and need to dig into the town\u2019s mysterious and terrible history before it\u2019s too late for each of them.\u201d\n\nRavenswood seemed promising at first, but viewers quickly realized that it could not live up to Pretty Little Liars, and the ratings, in return, suffered.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got some big news,\u201d Blackburn said, during a statement on the YouTube series Behind the Curtain. \u201cI\u2019m heading back to Rosewood and I will be back this summer on Pretty Little Liars. Thank you so much for all of your support, I love you guys.\u201d\n\nThank you all for welcoming me back! Season 5 of @ABCFpll is going be intense!! \u2014 Tyler Blackburn (@tylerjblackburn) March 12, 2014\n\nIt looks like Blackburn\u2019s return will lead to a serious love triangle between his ex-girlfriend Hannah, and her new love interest Travis. When Caleb left for Ravenswood, he and Hannah decided to part ways, but they left the door open for a possible rekindling of their romance. However, since Caleb has been gone, Hannah has been getting pretty cozy with Travis, and it looks like she may have moved on for good.\n\nAccording to ABC Family, Blackburn\u2019s return will happen early in the fifth season, and will be a \u201clovely reunion\u201d. Are they talking about a reunion with the liars as a whole, or more specifically just Hannah? I guess we will have to wait and see how it play out.\n\nThe fourth season of Pretty Little Liars will wrap up on March 18, and the fifth season will kick off on June 10.\n\nDo you want Hannah and Caleb to get back together, or do you think she should stay with Travis?
