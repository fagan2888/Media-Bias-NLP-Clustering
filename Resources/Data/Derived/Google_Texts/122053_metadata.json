Your budget can probably handle all three, but not as long as you\u2019re renting. In recent years, rental costs have increased while home ownership costs have decreased \u2013 making home ownership the best way to invest your money.\n\nMortgage interest rates are historically low, which means the payments you\u2019re making for rent could be much more valuable to you if you were making them on a home loan. Here are several reasons why you should consider making the cost-saving transition from renting to owning.\n\nThe way to build equity is through home ownership\n\nYour monthly rental payment won\u2019t build equity because you don\u2019t own the property. Owning a home earns you equity value that can be unlocked to use for your children\u2019s college savings, home improvements, paying off debt or several other enticing incentives.\n\nYou can afford more than you think\n\nRenters often believe the myth that home ownership is more expensive than renting. In most cases, this could not be further from the truth. What you are paying each month in rent could equate to a mortgage payment for a home that is as nice or nicer than what you\u2019re currently living in. A qualified loan officer can help you crunch the numbers and learn what kind of property you could afford with the amount you\u2019re paying in rent.\n\nA fixed-rate mortgage payment never goes up\n\nSay goodbye to the fear of a monthly payment increase. Your rent almost always goes up when your lease is renewed, but with a fixed-rate mortgage, the principal and interest payments never go up. You can plan for the future without the stress of paying more rent.\n\nOwning means tax benefits\n\nYour rent payment is not tax deductible. The tax incentives of owning a home alone can make the switch from renting to owning worthwhile. If you own a home, the interest portion of your mortgage payment could be tax deductible and you may also be able to deduct real estate property taxes and any points you may have paid at closing.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been paying rent and have good credit, now is the time to make the transition to home ownership and experience all these benefits and more. Talk to a qualified loan officer at Movement Mortgage today to learn more about your financing options to stop renting and start owning.\n\nTo continue reading this article and others, please go to www.NewHomesAndIdeas.com", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2015-05-16 12:34:00", "description": "In recent years, rental costs have increased while home ownership costs have decreased - making home ownership the best way to invest your money.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2015-08-18 11:23:52", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=14649754|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "In recent years, rental costs have increased while home ownership costs have decreased - making home ownership the best way to invest your money.", "title": "Home ownership makes financial sense :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/home-ownership-makes-financial-sense/14649754/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/lifestyles/house_and_home/2015/05/16/14649756/14649756-1437591540-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "pinterest": "nohover", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-16T12:34:00-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "In recent years, rental costs have increased while home ownership costs have decreased - making home ownership the best way to invest your money.", "title": "Home ownership makes financial sense :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/home-ownership-makes-financial-sense/14649754/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/lifestyles/house_and_home/2015/05/16/14649756/184280-home-750x400.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbabc\"", "article_summary": "In recent years, rental costs have increased while home ownership costs have decreased \u2013 making home ownership the best way to invest your money.\nA fixed-rate mortgage payment never goes upSay goodbye to the fear of a monthly payment increase.\nYour budget can probably handle all three, but not as long as you\u2019re renting.\nIf you\u2019ve been paying rent and have good credit, now is the time to make the transition to home ownership and experience all these benefits and more.\nOwning means tax benefitsYour rent payment is not tax deductible."}
