The proposed labels would have read, \u201cSTATE OF CALIFORNIA SAFETY WARNING: Drinking beverages with added sugar(s) contributes to obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay.\u201d\n\nSenate Bill (SB) 1000 would have required the label to be placed on the front of all beverage containers with added sweeteners that have 75 or more calories per 12 ounces. The bill needed 10 votes to pass, but fell short with a 7-8 vote. Some lawmakers doubted whether a label change would change consumer behavior.\n\n\u201cChanging behavior is the hardest challenge in the world of medicine,\u201d Senator Bill Monning told lawmakers before the vote, the Daily Mail reported. \u201cBut you can\u2019t start to even make a commitment to make behavior change if you don\u2019t have the information.\u201d\n\nThe label design was developed by public health advocates using cigarette and alcohol warnings as a model. Current labels on cigarette packages in the United States highlight negative health effects by stating warnings regarding illnesses linked to smoking, such as, lung cancer, heart disease, and emphysema.\n\nDemocratic Assemblyman Jimmy Gomez pointed out that cigarette warning labels were accompanied by taxes and prohibitions on smoking in public places before tobacco use plunged. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t necessarily the labels that changed peoples\u2019 habits, but it was the other requirements,\u201d Gomez said, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nRepresentatives of the beverage industry argued that the bill was unfair because it didn't target other foods and drinks, like lattes and chocolate milk.\n\n\u201cWhile I am disappointed SB 1000 did not pass out of Committee, I remain committed to pursuing this issue and being part of a broad public health campaign to educate communities about the proven health risks of sugary drinks,\u201d Monning said in a statement. \u201cProtecting the public\u2019s health from the adverse effects of these products will help combat the diabetes and obesity epidemics in California.\u201d\n\nA similar bill was introduced in Vermont last year, and would require manufacturers to put warning labels on beverages that contain sugar or other artificial additives. The bill has been held in the Committee on Human Services since April.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "california obesity warning labels, sugary drinks", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "In an attempt to warn the public about the negative health effects of sugary drinks, Senator Bill Monning\u2019s bill gets turned down.", "title": "California Lawmakers Reject 'Obesity' Warning Labels On Sugary Drinks", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/californias-push-obesity-warning-labels-sugary-drinks-akin-tobacco-gets-rejected-288766", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/18/soda-aisle.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In an attempt to warn the public about the negative health effects of sugary drinks, Senator Bill Monning\u2019s bill gets turned down.", "title": "California Lawmakers Reject 'Obesity' Warning Labels On Sugary Drinks", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/californias-push-obesity-warning-labels-sugary-drinks-akin-tobacco-gets-rejected-288766", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/18/soda-aisle.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/18/soda-aisle.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Policy/Biz", "published_time": "2014-06-18T11:51:20-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-18T11:51:19-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "In an attempt to warn the public about the negative health effects of sugary drinks, Senator Bill Monning\u2019s bill gets turned down."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf021\"", "article_summary": "The California bill requiring sugary drinks to have warning labels advertising negative health effects failed on Tuesday with the Assembly\u2019s health committee.\nCalifornia lawmakers rejected the bill that would require soda and other sugary soft drinks to be labeled with health warnings.\nDemocratic Assemblyman Jimmy Gomez pointed out that cigarette warning labels were accompanied by taxes and prohibitions on smoking in public places before tobacco use plunged.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t necessarily the labels that changed peoples\u2019 habits, but it was the other requirements,\u201d Gomez said, according to the Daily Mail.\n\u201cChanging behavior is the hardest challenge in the world of medicine,\u201d Senator Bill Monning told lawmakers before the vote, the Daily Mail reported."}
