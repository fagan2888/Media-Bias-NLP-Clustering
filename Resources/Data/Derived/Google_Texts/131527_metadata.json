But soon, SEIU could find itself becoming a player in another sector in which government plays a major role: American public education. And the union\u2019s presence may not be welcomed either by the National Education Association or the America Federation of Teachers, the dominant unions in education policymaking.\n\nIn Los Angeles, SEIU is already making waves thanks to Local 99 in Los Angeles, which has become a force in backing the efforts of school reformers \u2014 including former Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Supt. John Deasy \u2014 to overhaul the faltering Unified School District there. The local represents nearly all of the janitors, lunchroom staffers, and other classified workers that aren\u2019t part of either United Teachers Los Angeles, the AFT\u2019s City of Angels local, or the school principal\u2019s union. Over the past three years, it has successfully backed Monica Garcia, the leading reformer on L.A. Unified\u2019s board, and also has put money behind the wishy-washy Steve Zimmer. It has also unsuccessfully backed reformers such as Villaraigosa protege Antonio Sanchez, who lost to former AFT local honcho Monica Ratliff last year.\n\nSo it wasn\u2019t surprising when Local 99\u2019s president, Barbara Torres, announced in April that she was considering a run for the school board seat held by longtime AFT ally Bennett Kayser. After all, the union spent $850,000 in 2011 to back the unsuccessful bid of Kayser opponent Luis Sanchez. While Torres decided last week to withdraw from the race, her sister, Kathryn, who runs the local\u2019s political action committee, is now stepping up to challenge Kayser. The popularity of both sisters among union members, along with their influential roles in L.A. politics, makes it a certainty that the younger Torres will get SEIU backing, and thus, rally both reformers and other unions to her corner. The AFT local is definitely not looking forward to the SEIU\u2019s challenge to its influence over the district.\n\nIn Sacramento, the SEIU\u2019s Local 1000, which represents teachers and school employees working in the Golden State\u2019s prisons and specialized schools, is increasingly becoming a force all its own. Two years ago, the local\u2019s Bargaining Unit 3 successfully convinced state legislators to pass Senate Bill 1121, which requires prisons to include teachers and principals in assessing the educational and workforce training needs of inmates. Another bargaining unit for the SEIU local, which represents school librarians, is also becoming an influential force in education policy-making. SEIU is also making waves in Washington State, where another local is teaming up with the NEA\u2019s Evergreen State affiliate to back Initiative 1351, which aims to devote more school funding toward class size reduction. At least in theory. One likely reason why the SEIU is backing the initiative because the wording of it would effectively allow any district to use the additional state dollars to hire custodians and other classified employees; more than likely, SEIU is using I-1351 as a Trojan Horse for its own aims \u2014 and not exactly to help the NEA expand its ranks.\n\nThen there is SEIU\u2019s major role in early childhood education, the reform currently in vogue among centrist Democrat reformers and traditionalists alike. The union, which counts thousands of Pre-K teachers and other staffers among its rank-and-file, has been a prominent backer of efforts to increase federal and state funding for the programs. In Seattle, its local has teamed up with AFT to launch a ballot initiative that would require childcare centers contracting with the city to pay a $15 minimum hourly wage to its workers \u2014 about $1.05 more than the average hourly wage currently earned by preschool teachers in the area.\n\nAs with so much with SEIU, the union\u2019s increasing prominence in American public education is largely driven by the profit motive. After all, SEIU has managed to increase its rank-and-file by 10 percent between 2004 and 2013 \u2014 even as organized labor continues to decline \u2014 because of its willingness to become a major force in any aspect of Corporate America and the public sector. Particularly in early childhood education, the prospects of increased federal funding means more rank-and-file workers and higher levels of union dues into the coffers.\n\nAt the same time, SEIU is also playing a more-prominent role in education because of Latinos \u2014 especially immigrants and first-generation American natives \u2014 who are the fastest-growing constituency within its rank-and-file. As with earlier generations of immigrants \u2014 including Irish and Italian populations who settled the nation\u2019s big cities \u2014 Latinos are quite aware that they can leverage public-sector employment for entering America\u2019s economic and political mainstream. They also realize that high-quality education is key to their children continuing the progress of their families into the middle class. As a result, SEIU ends up straddling a line, supporting reform measures even as it also tries to preserve union privileges.\n\nThen there is the role of mayoral control of education in furthering SEIU\u2019s influence. Because mayors are elected by an entire city and not concerned just with education matters, it also means that public sector unions with a wide range of concerns will have greater influence over district operations than AFT and NEA locals. This is especially true for SEIU, which has a much wider footprint than the AFT in municipal politics. As seen in New York City last year, when SEIU\u2019s local successfully backed Bill de Blasio\u2019s mayoral bid (while the AFT\u2019s Big Apple local chose losing candidate Bill Thompson) and gained an influential role in the new administration, the union has the potential to outmuscle teachers\u2019 unions when it sees fit.\n\nIn the process of expanding into education, SEIU could end up further weakening NEA and AFT influence over education policymaking.\n\nBecause of SEIU\u2019s massive size, it can serve as a counter-weight to efforts by NEA and AFT affiliates to ensure that school librarians and other workers are the first to be laid off during periods of budget-cutting. Given the union\u2019s penchant for deviating from traditional union thinking, one can imagine its locals and affiliates teaming up with reformers to pass laws ending reverse-seniority (or last in-first out) layoff rules; SEIU units are also likely to demand that districts lay off laggard veterans (who have already attained decades of benefits thanks to quality-blind seniority rules) instead of the librarians and custodians it represents.\n\nSEIU\u2019s tendency to strike cozy deals with bureaucrats and corporate executives \u2014 often agreeing to replace defined-benefit pensions with defined-contribution plans in exchange for gaining the ability to unionize staffs \u2014 also makes it a threat to the decades of dealmaking that NEA and AFT locals hold so dear. Even worse for NEA and AFT locals, SEIU\u2019s sharp-elbowed tactics makes it a threat to unionize the very teachers the two unions have long claimed to represent. As SEIU proved six years ago when it unsuccessfully tried to take over the AFT\u2019s former affiliate in Puerto Rico with the backing of the territory\u2019s governor, the union is more than willing to appeal to teachers, especially those wholly unsatisfied with how the NEA and AFT represent their interests, yet unwilling to embrace the professional association model that many younger teachers support.\n\nThe union\u2019s considerable coffers, which, like those of the NEA and AFT, are funded by forced dues payments by rank-and-file members, gives it the ability to fight the two unions in political contests. One can easily see SEIU locals in other cities weighing in on school board elections the same way Local 99 has done within the past decade. That SEIU also has lots of bodies at its disposal also makes it a threat to NEA and AFT dominance in states and districts.\n\nMeanwhile SEIU\u2019s strong presence in early childhood education programs (along with that of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees) makes the union an obstacle to the AFT\u2019s efforts to expand its influence into that sector. As sly as AFT President Randi Weingarten may be, she has never gone up against the likes of SEIU boss Mary Kay Henry or her notorious predecessor, Andy Stern, both of whom even more ruthless than she is when it comes to getting their way.\n\nBut will SEIU\u2019s presence in education benefit school reformers? Depends on what you mean by benefit. If further weakening NEA and AFT affiliates \u2014 along with advancing some key reforms \u2014 is part of the goal, then yes, SEIU may be helpful. At the end of the day, however, SEIU is still a union, no different than the NEA and AFT in advancing its own agenda at the expense of children, taxpayers, and even its own rank-and-file members. Either way, the growing role of SEIU in education policymaking is a matter which reformers must watch cautiously.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "article_summary": "In the process of expanding into education, SEIU could end up further weakening NEA and AFT influence over education policymaking.\nIt has also unsuccessfully backed reformers such as Villaraigosa protege Antonio Sanchez, who lost to former AFT local honcho Monica Ratliff last year.\nThe AFT local is definitely not looking forward to the SEIU\u2019s challenge to its influence over the district.\nIf further weakening NEA and AFT affiliates \u2014 along with advancing some key reforms \u2014 is part of the goal, then yes, SEIU may be helpful.\nAnother bargaining unit for the SEIU local, which represents school librarians, is also becoming an influential force in education policy-making."}
