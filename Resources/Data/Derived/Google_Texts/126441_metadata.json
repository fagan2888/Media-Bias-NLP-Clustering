This time, it was her sabbatical from her job as a professor. I asked whether we could deduct the travel and lodging expenses from her stints at two universities far from home.\n\nTurboTax offers several kinds of assistance. First is its online community, AnswerXchange, which the website says is composed of \u201cTurboTax support experts and customers just like you.\u201d (Given my near total ignorance of tax law, I\u2019m not sure I want guidance from the likes of me.) The community resembles the comment string at the end of an online article or blog posting: You can pose a question, and registered users can answer. Or you can search previously answered questions.\n\nI dutifully filed my question, and a community member, who called herself TurboTaxNatasha, responded to my inquiry within an hour. She suggested that a sabbatical might count as nondeductible \u201ceducational travel.\u201d I pointed out that my wife\u2019s sabbatical was primarily devoted to research, not sipping sauvignon blanc in the south of France. TurboTaxNatasha waffled: \u201cI recommend that your wife speak with her employer or contact the I.R.S. directly.\u201d I wondered how \u201chelp\u201d from TurboTax could entail instructions to call the I.R.S. That seemed more akin to punishment \u2014 especially since the tax agency has warned that this year\u2019s telephone wait times could top 30 minutes.\n\nI then tried TurboTax\u2019s phone assistance \u2014 and inadvertently misdialed the software help line. Eventually, I ended up in the right place and reached a TurboTax representative who identified herself as Bonnie P. We chatted for about 15 minutes. She quizzed me and concluded that the sabbatical expenses were probably deductible \u2014 they were work-related and seemed necessary \u2014 but added that she knew of no applicable I.R.S. regulation.\n\nH&R Block\n\nGetting an answer from H&R Block proved easier, which highlighted the company\u2019s strength. H&R Block uses its nationwide staff of tax pros \u2014 it operates a chain of more than 11,000 tax preparation shops \u2014 to backstop its online customer service.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs with TurboTax, you\u2019re encouraged to start by searching a repository of previously answered questions. If that doesn\u2019t work, you can click on a box taking you to an online chat or a phone number. I opted for the web chat and soon reached \u201cYoung L.\u201d Young pointed me to a passage in the 2014 I.R.S. Publication 17 tax guide. It explained that a professor\u2019s expenses relating to research and teaching, including travel, often can be deducted, but the wording did offer a little wiggle room for the I.R.S.\n\nPhoto\n\nThat\u2019s not the only way H&R Block distinguishes itself. The company also offers customers the promise of in-person representation by an H&R Block expert, at no additional cost, in the case of an I.R.S. audit. Audits are rare \u2014 the I.R.S. does in-person examinations of about only 1 percent of returns \u2014 but the guarantee is like an insurance policy: a major relief if needed. TurboTax charges Home and Business customers $60 for this service, and TaxACT charges $40 for all filers. Both require that you buy it before filing your return.\n\nOtherwise, H&R Block\u2019s software worked much like TurboTax, though not as smoothly. For reasons unclear (the fault could have been mine) my browser, Safari, froze as I was importing last year\u2019s return to the H&R Block website. I quit and signed into my online account again, and the pertinent information was there.\n\nTax filing will be different this year because of the Affordable Care Act. For the first time, people must provide their health insurance information on their returns, so all three programs include this topic in their interview questions. If you have employer-provided insurance, you simply answer a few yes-or-no questions, no matter which program you use.\n\nH&R Block also has added an informative feature called Refund Reveal. All three programs keep a running tally of your tax payment or refund as you answer their interview questions. With H&R Block, if you click on that amount, you see a breakdown of what\u2019s contributing to your total. TaxACT gives a less detailed tally.\n\nTaxACT\n\nTaxACT provided the most improved experience this year.\n\nIn the past, I\u2019ve occasionally found it more difficult to use than TurboTax or H&R Block, and once in a while its instructions would confuse me. This year, the online program wouldn\u2019t import the PDF of last year\u2019s return. When I tried, I got a message saying the upload had failed, which meant I had to type everything in. But beyond that, its offering and apps worked just as well as the others.\n\nLike TurboTax and H&R Block, the program asks questions about your circumstances and finances. There is a difference, however. The interview seems to mention farming more often, perhaps reflecting the company\u2019s roots in the Corn Belt. (TaxACT is based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.)\n\nI emailed TaxACT, too, with my question about the sabbatical expenses. One of its helpers, Jeff, emailed back within four hours. He didn\u2019t confirm that we could get a deduction, but he did provide a critical piece of information, explaining the I.R.S.\u2019s definition of ordinary and necessary business expenses.\n\nFinally, TaxACT\u2019s prices continue to impress. For a federal and a state return, it would have cost my family nearly $100 less than TurboTax \u2014 recall that TaxACT\u2019s Ultimate Bundle is only $20. If you fret over the portion of your paycheck that\u2019s given to Uncle Sam \u2014 and who doesn\u2019t? \u2014 it might be worth a try.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150214100835, "twitter": {"description": "Advances in tax prep software from H&R Block, TaxACT and TurboTax may make for more relaxing returns, though each service offers specific strengths.", "title": "Better Software Lets You Kick Back and Do Your Taxes", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/business/yourtaxes/reviewing-tax-preparation-software-that-maneuvers-from-mobile-to-desktop.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003487948"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/15/business/15-SOFT/15-SOFT-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/business/yourtaxes/reviewing-tax-preparation-software-that-maneuvers-from-mobile-to-desktop.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003487948", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/business/yourtaxes/reviewing-tax-preparation-software-that-maneuvers-from-mobile-to-desktop.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "business/yourtaxes", "hdl_p": "Better Software Lets You Kick Back and Do Your Taxes", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 14, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Intuit Inc", "keywords": "Tax Preparers and Preparation,Mobile Applications,Software,H&R Block Inc,TaxACT Inc,Federal Taxes (US),Intuit Inc,Tablet Computers,Smartphones,Computers and the Internet", "news_keywords": "Software,Smartphone", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Tim Gray", "SCG": "yourtaxes", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By TIM GRAY", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Advances in tax prep software from H&R Block, TaxACT and TurboTax may make for more relaxing returns, though each service offers specific strengths.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/15/business/15-SOFT/15-SOFT-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Advances in tax prep software from H&R Block, TaxACT and TurboTax may make for more relaxing returns, though each service offers specific strengths.", "CG": "business", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Feb. 14, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section": "Business Day", "modified": "2015-02-17", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "tag": "Computers and the Internet", "published": "2015-02-14", "section-taxonomy-id": "104D1E63-9701-497B-8CF4-A4D120C9014E"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "15soft", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150217170652, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/business/yourtaxes/reviewing-tax-preparation-software-that-maneuvers-from-mobile-to-desktop.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/15/business/15-SOFT/15-SOFT-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Advances in tax prep software from H&R Block, TaxACT and TurboTax may make for more relaxing returns, though each service offers specific strengths.", "title": "Better Software Lets You Kick Back and Do Your Taxes"}, "pdate": 20150214, "des": "Computers and the Internet", "articleid": 100000003487948, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Better Software Lets You Kick Back and Do Your Taxes", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/15/business/15-SOFT/15-SOFT-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "With H&R Block, if you click on that amount, you see a breakdown of what\u2019s contributing to your total.\nH&R BlockGetting an answer from H&R Block proved easier, which highlighted the company\u2019s strength.\nFor reasons unclear (the fault could have been mine) my browser, Safari, froze as I was importing last year\u2019s return to the H&R Block website.\nH&R Block also has added an informative feature called Refund Reveal.\nPhotoThat\u2019s not the only way H&R Block distinguishes itself."}
