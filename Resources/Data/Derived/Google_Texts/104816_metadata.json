Vicky Hartzler, R-Mo., and Karen Bass, D-Calif., were joined by advocates and state officials for the lunchtime meeting in the Boone County Commission chambers. They learned that former foster children who cross state lines to attend college or take a job lose their health care coverage under Medicaid.\n\nYou must login to view the full content on this page.

Foster children are covered by Medicaid, which must cover those children up to age 26 as well. The question is whether the law was intended to be state-specific, requiring coverage for a ward of \u201cthe state,\u201d or general, extending coverage to children who were a ward of \u201ca state.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that crazy?\u201d Bass said in an interview after the event. \u201cIt has led to kids not getting health care, because somebody in some office somewhere that was disconnected from the planet said it was one word versus another.\u201d\n\nThe round-table discussion, sponsored by the National Foster Youth Institute and the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth, featured personal stories from former foster children as well as a discussion of barriers to effective programs.\n\nAlong with the health insurance issue, Hartzler and Bass learned that federal aid only pays for foster programs after a child is removed from their home.\n\n\u201cIt would be helpful if dollars for foster children could be used for preventive programs prior to placement, but right now they are prevented from doing that,\u201d Hartzler said. \u201cThey were pointing out it was a lot more cost-beneficial for the taxpayer if we can prevent somebody from going into the foster care system.\u201d\n\nBass and Hartzler said they would work to add flexibility to both the Medicaid rules and federal aid for child welfare programs.\n\nFor children in foster care, communication that tells them what is expected of them and what they can expect is important, said Laura Gray, 18, a member of the State Youth Advisory Board. Gray said she was placed in foster care at age 5 and adopted while in the third grade. The adoption, for a reason she did not reveal, fell through, and she returned to foster care.\n\nGray said she was adopted again at 16 but said she wasn\u2019t always sure what her status was and what to expect.\n\n\u201cThe one thing I would work on if I was in charge would be communication,\u201d she said. \u201cI had a wonderful family support team but my worker and I didn\u2019t always communicate very well.\u201d\n\nMissouri has approximately 12,500 children in foster care, said Tim Decker, director of the Children\u2019s Division of the Missouri Department of Social Services. The top goal of the division is to keep families together, he said.\n\nWhen a child is removed from a home, the division first attempts to solve the issues that make the home unsafe and reunify the family, Decker said. When that is impossible, the division looks for a way to place a child with adoptive parents or a permanent guardian.\n\nThere are 1,400 children in the \u201cHeart Gallery of Missouri,\u201d an online service that seeks to connect children needing permanent homes with prospective parents.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=5; cycle=1", "googlebot": "noarchive", "application-name": "Columbia Tribune", "p": {"domain_verify": "e84f2ccdbb23b2303cfa08c12e9bd926"}, "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/wide.png?_dc=1372340732", "twitter": {"description": "A bureaucratic debate over sentence construction is denying health care to young adults who were once in foster care, a round table on child welfare learned Monday.", "title": "Foster care forum highlights barriers to effective programs", "image": {"src": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/9e/c9e8b3f0-02e7-5435-b1c0-840b85009859/53bc347e84155.preview-800.jpg"}, "creator": "@CDTCivilWar", "site": "@columbiatribune", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#065874", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/tiny.png?_dc=1372340614", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/large.png?_dc=1372340596", "og": {"site_name": "Columbia Daily Tribune", "description": "A bureaucratic debate over sentence construction is denying health care to young adults who were once in foster care, a round table on child welfare learned Monday.", "title": "Foster care forum highlights barriers to effective programs", "url": "http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/politics/foster-care-forum-highlights-barriers-to-effective-programs/article_4987e5ce-185f-5050-834c-8dc178aa4bf6.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/9e/c9e8b3f0-02e7-5435-b1c0-840b85009859/53bc347e4cb1f.image.jpg?resize=1000%2C665", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 299470460147166}, "msvalidate.01": "1E3A617C7822235CF7453A03AC560148", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/t-badge_144.png?_dc=1372343381", "keywords": "vicky hartzler,foster care,family,social issues,medicaid,karen bass,child protective services,boone county commission,patient protection and affordable care act,national foster youth institute", "google-site-verification": "Pa-FtOcowtRH8XQjoX9dIrD_ncPLS80pMIWeoJZyZnA", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/square.png?_dc=1372340606", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "description": "A bureaucratic debate over sentence construction is denying health care to young adults who were once in foster care, a round table on child welfare learned Monday."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddc9d\"", "article_summary": "Gray said she was placed in foster care at age 5 and adopted while in the third grade.\nThe adoption, for a reason she did not reveal, fell through, and she returned to foster care.\nA bureaucratic debate over sentence construction is denying health care to young adults who were once in foster care, a round table on child welfare learned Monday.\nFoster children are covered by Medicaid, which must cover those children up to age 26 as well.\nThey learned that former foster children who cross state lines to attend college or take a job lose their health care coverage under Medicaid."}
