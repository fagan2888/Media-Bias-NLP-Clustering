This is not just annoying \u2013 it adds up.\n\nWhile it\u2019s great news for the industry \u2013 Consumer Reports estimates that in 2013, hotels made about $2.1 billion in fees and surcharges, almost double the amount they made in 2000 \u2013 it\u2019s likely hurting your wallet.\n\nRelated: 6 Sneaky Fees That Are Making Airlines a Bundle\n\nHere are the four most irksome hotel fees, based on a recent survey by VacationHomeRentals.com:\n\nParking is by far the most unexpected hotel fee, according to the survey. The fee, ranging from $20 to $30 per day, is usually not advertised. \u201cHotels assume you won\u2019t have a car,\u201d said Tom Gilmore, CEO of VacationHomeRentals.com.\n\nWiFi is another surprising fee. Most of the time, hotels charge you daily for Internet access in your room. It\u2019s also common for hotels to charge for Wifi per computer, which can quickly add up if you\u2019re traveling as a family and everyone brings their own device.\n\n\u201cIt usually expires unless you renew it and the cost usually shows up on your bill at the end of your stay,\u201d said Gilmore. The price for WiFi at luxury hotels such as the Waldorf Astoria in New York City is between $15 and $20 a day.\n\nResort or hotel fee is one of those vague fees you see on your bill at check out \u2013 without really knowing what it covers. While it varies by resort, it can cover anything from the hotel\u2019s business center to the use of newspapers and fitness centers. Because of the wide spectrum of amenities it can cover, the resort fee can range from a few dollars to nearly $50 a night.\n\nRelated: Another Reason to Hate the TSA\n\nPool or beach towel fees are low, usually only a couple of dollars per towel \u2013 but they can add up if you forget them in your room and use a fresh one every day.\n\nOther surprising fees that came up in the survey include early check-in and late arrival, additional guests, minibar drinks and snacks, and room service delivery. Hotel taxes can also be a big surprise when you get your final bill since they differ so much depending on the city and the state you're in.\n\nTo minimize these fees, do your research. Ask the hotel whether any of these fees apply. If they do, budget extra funds to cover them or plan ahead and find cheaper options such as street parking, bringing your own beach towels, and finding free WiFi in the town you\u2019re visiting.\n\nOf course, you can always avoid hotels altogether and book a vacation rental, which is becoming more popular. A February survey by TripAdvisor found that 52 percent of 1,000-plus respondents surveyed were planning to rent a vacation property this year, up from 44 percent in 2013.\n\n\u201cVacation rental is slowly getting more top of mind for Americans,\u201d said Gilmore. \u201cA lot of online sites are making it easier.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Hotels, just", "title": "4 Hidden Hotel Fees That Pump Up Your Bill", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/07/4-Hidden-Hotel-Fees-Pump-Your-Bill", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/SLIB-Shangri-La-Suite.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/07/4-Hidden-Hotel-Fees-Pump-Your-Bill", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/SLIB-Shangri-La-Suite.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Hotels, just", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca9ea\"", "article_summary": "Related: 6 Sneaky Fees That Are Making Airlines a BundleHere are the four most irksome hotel fees, based on a recent survey by VacationHomeRentals.com:Parking is by far the most unexpected hotel fee, according to the survey.\nResort or hotel fee is one of those vague fees you see on your bill at check out \u2013 without really knowing what it covers.\nHotels, just like airlines, are become masters at charging extra fees that aren\u2019t included in your initial room quote.\nAsk the hotel whether any of these fees apply.\nHotel taxes can also be a big surprise when you get your final bill since they differ so much depending on the city and the state you're in."}
