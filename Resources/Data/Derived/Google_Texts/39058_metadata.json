(Because Obamacare apparently extends coverage to kittens, ducklings and rabbits as well.)\n\n\"Kitten coverage till age 26: prayers answered. Thanks Adorable Care Act.\" Reads one gif with a ridiculously cute kitten. Another one, featuring a piglet, asks, \"Wait being cute isn't a pre-existing condition anymore?\"\n\nIf you give into the cuteness and fall for the clickbait, the Tumblr directs you to Healthcare.gov, a government sponsored site that explains how to enroll in the health exchanges under Obamacare that takes effect Oct 1.\n\nThe Tumblr, created by a former Obama campaign staffer, is just the latest effort by Obamacare advocates to convince young people to sign up for health insurance through the exchanges starting next week.\n\nApparently Obama's team of celebrity recruiters--like Oprah Winfrey, LeBron James and Jay-Z, among others--just isn't cutting it.\n\nRELATED: WHY MILLENNIALS ARE OBAMACARE'S LAST HOPE\n\nIn fact, according to recent polls, the majority of Americans don't like Obamacare at all. The latest USA Today poll found that 53 percent of Americans said they disapprove of the law, while 42 percent said they approve.\n\nTo be sure, the poll was conducted prior to the adorable animals' endorsement of the law. So it's impact is still unclear.\n\nMeanwhile, Obamacare opponents are clawing back with their own animal attack.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Adorable Care Act is just the latest effort by Obamacare advocates to convince young people to sign up for health insurance through the exchanges starting next week.", "title": "Can Adorable Baby Animals Save Obamacare?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/09/27/Can-Adorable-Baby-Animals-Save-Obamacare", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Screen%20Shot%202013-09-27%20at%201.47.34%20PM.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/09/27/Can-Adorable-Baby-Animals-Save-Obamacare", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Screen%20Shot%202013-09-27%20at%201.47.34%20PM.png", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The Adorable Care Act is just the latest effort by Obamacare advocates to convince young people to sign up for health insurance through the exchanges starting next week.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd810f\"", "article_summary": "Thanks Adorable Care Act.\"\nTo be sure, the poll was conducted prior to the adorable animals' endorsement of the law.\nRELATED: WHY MILLENNIALS ARE OBAMACARE'S LAST HOPEIn fact, according to recent polls, the majority of Americans don't like Obamacare at all.\n(Because Obamacare apparently extends coverage to kittens, ducklings and rabbits as well.)\nCan an adorable little kitten persuade you to buy health insurance?"}
