However, the OIG found at least $900,000 in payments that went to manufacturer\u2019s \u201cpersonal use.\u201d\n\nFor instance, one recipient used government funds to buy two Ford Explorers, costing over $45,500. The recipient bought a Ford Explorer and then traded it in for a new one 11 months later, the day before a government deadline requiring the funds to be spent or paid back to the USDA\u2019s Farm Service Agency (FSA).\n\n\u201cAltogether, we questioned 75 expenditures, totaling over $2.4 million,\u201d the OIG said. \u201cThis occurred because FSA has not implemented effective internal controls to determine which capital expenditures are eligible uses of EAAP funds.\u201d\n\nA recipient also spent $6,500 worth of cotton subsidies to \u201cto decorate executive offices with carpet and artwork.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother user spent EAAP funds on decor, such as artwork and an elephant lamp for the Chief Executive Officer\u2019s office and for carpet at one of its operating plants for the managers\u2019 offices,\u201d the audit said.\n\nThe $2.4 million in unallowable purchases also went towards unused equipment \u201ccovered in dust and cobwebs,\u201d and other items unrelated to the cotton industry.\n\n\u201cTwenty-one of the questionable expenditures OIG identified, totaling over $93,000, were not directly related to cotton production operations,\u201d the OIG said. \u201cExamples of these include lawn mowers, a hearing booth, a portable sound system, a TV monitor for a guard station, computers and other IT equipment for corporate offices, grass seed, and road repairs.\u201d\n\nOver $58,000 was spent on unused equipment and more than $675,000 was paid for replacement parts that \u201cdid not modernize the user\u2019s operations.\u201d Other waste included more than $7,000 on \u201cservice warranties for two vehicles, a service contract for a computer, and internal labor.\u201d\n\n\u201cOIG concluded that these types of expenditures, which were allowed by FSA, represent waste and abuse of EAAP funds, as they do not have direct applicability to the manufacturing of upland cotton into eligible cotton products by the user that made them,\u201d the audit said.\n\nAside from funding being wasted on personal items, the audit also found that the government has no way of knowing whether the program as a whole, which has cost taxpayers more than $300 million, has benefited the textile industry.\n\nThe FSA failed to establish a \u201cpurpose or goal\u201d for the program, or ways to evaluate its performance.\n\n\u201cEven though the agency anticipated payments would limit market losses, plant closures, and employment declines, FSA has not developed a way to measure this impact,\u201d the OIG said. \u201cInstead, the agency views paying users in a timely manner and assuring that the users spend the money within required timeframes to be its only purpose in administering the program.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout established goals and related outcome measures, FSA cannot demonstrate that the $337 million spent between August 2008 and July 2013 has stimulated the United States textile industry, or determine to what extent the assistance actually improved the condition of users as they compete in a global market,\u201d the audit said.\n\nThe EAAP program is meant to boost the textile industry, and keep America competitive with other countries. Manufacturers received 4 cents per pound of cotton produced up until July 2012. They now receive 3 cents per pound.\n\nThe USDA has strict guidelines for how money from the program can be spent.\n\n\u201cThe payments must be used to acquire new property, plant, and equipment or upgrade the existing capital facilities, and equipment, and the user agrees upon accepting program payments to open its records to audits by the Department of Agriculture (USDA),\u201d the OIG explained. \u201cPayments may only be used for capital investments to acquire, construct, install, modernize, develop, convert, or expand land, plant, equipment, facilities or machinery.\u201d\n\nThe OIG concluded that the FSA did not \u201csufficiently ensure that funds expended are not a waste or abuse of Government funds,\u201d and recommended that the agency prohibit purchases that are \u201cwholly or partially for personal use by executives and employees.\u201d\n\nWhile the FSA agreed that it would disallow purchases that are wholly for personal use, they disagreed that items sometimes used for personal reasons should be prohibited.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) cotton subsidies meant to assist the textile industry are being spent on Ford Explorers, artwork, sound systems, and elephant lamps, according to a government wat", "title": "USDA Cotton Subsidies Pay for Cars, Elephant Lamps, Artwork", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/usda-cotton-subsidies-pay-for-cars-elephant-lamps-artwork/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/ford-explorer--150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) cotton subsidies meant to assist the textile industry are bein", "creator": "@LizWFB", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/ford-explorer--150x150.jpg", "title": "USDA Cotton Subsidies Pay for Cars, Elephant Lamps, Artwork", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4168\"", "article_summary": "BY: Follow @LizWFBU.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) cotton subsidies meant to assist the textile industry are being spent on Ford Explorers, artwork, sound systems, and elephant lamps, according to a government watchdog.\n\u201cTwenty-one of the questionable expenditures OIG identified, totaling over $93,000, were not directly related to cotton production operations,\u201d the OIG said.\nThe USDA has strict guidelines for how money from the program can be spent.\nThe $2.4 million in unallowable purchases also went towards unused equipment \u201ccovered in dust and cobwebs,\u201d and other items unrelated to the cotton industry.\nThe program, which was created in the 2008 Farm bill, pays textile mills 3 cents per pound of upland cotton they produce to be used on investments, equipment, and new property."}
