Abrams\u2019 \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d is a fun and exciting film. Older audiences will be pleased as they remember their childhoods of the 1970s and 1980s. A new generation of fans who only know the more recent prequel films \u2014 and were likely left wondering \u201cWhy is \u2018Star Wars\u2019 such a big deal?\u201d\u2014 will finally begin to understand why \u201cStar Wars\u201d captivated several generations of viewers around the world.\n\n\u201cStar Wars\u201d is an example of \u201cthe monomyth\u201d \u2014 a set of story forms and narrative structures that are common across all cultures and which together form a shared human mythology.\n\nAs such, J.J. Abrams takes the \u201cStar Wars\u201d formula of a quest \u2014 a magical item, family secrets, the coming of age struggle, finding one\u2019s destiny and the battle between good and evil \u2014 and continues it in \u201cThe Force Awakens.\u201d \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d is for the most part a remix of \u201cStar Wars: A New Hope.\u201d As an example of the monomyth and the subsequent repeated themes present in all the \u201cStar Wars\u201d films, this is to be expected.\n\n\u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d hearkens back to its origins in George Lucas\u2019s original \u201cStar Wars\u201d trilogy. \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d is also grounded firmly in the Age of Obama and a multicultural, \u201cpost-racial\u201d present.\n\nThe original \u201cStar Wars\u201d films created a filmic imaginary galaxy that was almost entirely populated by white people. \u201cStar Wars\u201d had a magical energy field called the Force, sentient droids, bizarre aliens, faster than light travel, lightsabers, and moon-sized battle stations that could destroy a planet with one blast of its laser. Yet there were no black or brown people in Lucas\u2019s original 1977 film. What cultural critic and scholar bell hooks and others have described as \u201coppositional reading\u201d turned the Star Wars universe upside down: If black and brown folks were not actually in the visual and narrative frame (or if there, depicted in a racist and derogatory manner by the White Gaze), they would imagine themselves still present in the movie.\n\nBlack audiences would cheer on the \u201cblack\u201d character Darth Vader as he killed \u201cwhite\u201d rebels. And there were no limitations on the racially transgressive act of childhood play where kids on the \u2018res, in black cities such as Chicago, communities like Harlem or in the barrios of Los Angeles would become Luke, Han, Leia or Chewbacca.\n\nGeorge Lucas, to his credit, attempted to correct this oversight. He cast Billy Dee Williams, then one of, if not the, most recognizable African-American Hollywood leading man of the era, in \u201cA New Hope\u2019s\u201d sequel, \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back.\u201d Williams\u2019 character would be one of the heroes in the (then) final movie Return of the Jedi. Billy Dee Williams would be joined in that movie by token and largely forgettable black characters \u2014 noticed only because of their conspicuousness \u2014 who were mostly cast in the role of random, nameless starfighter pilots and who died in the final climactic battle. Lucas tried to make a more diverse and representative world in his Star Wars prequels. But again, this well-intentioned effort was overshadowed by the Steppin Fetchit, race minstrel-like character known as Jar-Jar Binks, the Charlie Chan Asian caricatures of the Galactic Trade Federation and Watto, an anti-Semitic stereotype embodied by the greedy, craven, slave master who owned a young Anakin Skywalker on the planet Tatooine.\n\nFortunately, people of color, especially those who are \u201cMillennials\u201d and younger, will not have to read themselves back into \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens.\u201d\n\nThe stars of Abrams\u2019 new Star Wars film are a black Stormtrooper named Finn (John Boyega) and a young white woman named \u201cRey\u201d (Daisy Ridley). They are joined by a charismatic and heroic starfighter pilot named Poe Dameron, who is played by the Latino actor Oscar Isaac. There are people of color and women in almost every scene of \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens.\u201d This extends to the antagonists in Abrams\u2019 new film as well. The newest iteration of the Empire \u2014 now known as the First Order \u2014 also demonstrates much more racial and gender diversity than its predecessor. In Lucas\u2019s original films, the Empire\u2019s soldiers were all white and male. They were modeled after the Nazis. More than just uniforms and regalia, the Empire possessed a racist, xenophobic and sexist political culture.\n\nThis is not diversity as racial \u201ctokenism.\u201d The women and people of color who populate Abrams\u2019 \u201cStar Wars\u201d film are present as quotidian fixtures; their existence is not marked by their uniqueness, but rather in how common and mundane humane diversity would be in the fantastical worlds of \u201ca long time ago\u201d and in \u201ca galaxy far, far away.\u201d\n\nThe diversity in \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d has the potential to be remarkably empowering for those black and brown folks, and white viewers too, that see this as the new normal. However, we must be cautious. Celebrating the racial and gender diversity of a movie while not simultaneously understanding how Hollywood, and the mass media more generally, reproduces and reinforces sexism and racism, can also be a distraction from substantive political and social change work.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The diversity in \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" has the potential to be remarkably empowering", "title": "Our new post-Obama \u201cStar Wars\u201d: Race, the Force and the dark side in modern America", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The diversity in \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" has the potential to be remarkably empowering", "title": "Our new post-Obama \u201cStar Wars\u201d: Race, the Force and the dark side in modern America", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/19/our_new_post_obama_star_wars_race_the_force_and_the_dark_side_in_modern_america/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/star_wars7.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The diversity in \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" has the potential to be remarkably empowering", "title": "Our new post-Obama \u201cStar Wars\u201d: Race, the Force and the dark side in modern America", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/star_wars7.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Chauncey DeVega", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, diversity, Editor's Picks, Race, Star Wars, Star Wars the Force Awakens", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: diversity, Editor's Picks, Race, Star Wars, Star Wars the Force Awakens, Entertainment NewsJ.J.
