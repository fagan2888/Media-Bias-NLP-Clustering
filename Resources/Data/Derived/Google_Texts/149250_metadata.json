But the Dallas County Medical Examiner and Irving police will make the final determination.\n\n\u201cWe have crossing arms in that area, and all the initial reports are all the signals and crossing arms were working properly,\u201d says Lyons.\n\nThere were 260 people aboard the train, and Lyons says there were no injuries to passengers. But, of course, incidents like this one are \u201cvery difficult for the operators as well as the people on board once they become aware of what happens.\u201d Officials said just before 6 p.m. that they would be transferred to another train while the investigation continues.\n\nA westbound TRE train from Union Station was also delayed, but DART officials said they were able to resume limited service about 6:30 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzAzL3dvbWFuLWtpbGxlZC1ieS10cmUtdHJhaW4tbmVhci1kb3dudG93bi1pcnZpbmctaW1wYWN0aW5nLXJhaWwtc2VydmljZS1mcm9tLWRhbGxhcy5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert Wilonsky", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Dallas Area Rapid Transit officials say a woman was killed Saturday afternoon by an eastbound Trinity Railway Express train near downtown Irving.
