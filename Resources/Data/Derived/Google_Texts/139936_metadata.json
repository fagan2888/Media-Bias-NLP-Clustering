As he was completing the turn, he ran into a pedestrian who was crossing the road heading east, according to TPD Sgt. Pete Dugan, department spokesman.\n\n\n\nThe officer immediately stopped and began to render first aid. The Tucson Fire Department responded and transported the pedestrian, a man in his 20s, with life-threatening injuries, which have since been stabilized, medical staff tell the TPD.\n\n\n\nThe officer and his passenger were uninjured.\n\nTraffic detectives were on scene much of the day, but the intersection has finally opened again, Dugan said.\n\nStay with Tucson News Now online and on air for updates.\n\n\n\nCopyright 2015 Tucson News Now.
