U.S. Sen. Mazie Hirono is channeling “Late Show” host David Letterman to denounce the Republican budget proposal.

In anticipation of the Senate vote this week, Hirono borrowed a format made famous by the CBS late-night host and released her own Top 10 list of reasons why she thinks the GOP budget “hurts the middle class and is bad for Hawaii.”

The list, released Tuesday and accompanied by 10 pictures of Hirono interacting with her constituents, calls the GOP plan “a disastrous framework that would rig the rules in favor of billionaires and special interests” and assails it for cutting a whole host of government programs.

Topping the list was Hirono’s critique of reductions to food stamps and two tax credits for low-income taxpayers, the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit.

Hirono goes on to criticize other belt-tightening measures — such as cuts to Medicare, Head Start, Pell and Title I grants — and disparages the Republicans for seeking to preserve special interest tax loopholes, to halt the construction and maintenance of national parks, and to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
