Please tell me they have it!\u201d Her license plate indicated she was from New Jersey, but on that cold morning between Christmas and New Year\u2019s she was in small-town central Vermont. She had come farther than I had: My drive was three hours from western Massachusetts, but mixed in with her out-of-state license plate and mine, I saw cars from New York, Connecticut and Pennsylvania. We were all there, hours from home, in search of the same thing: beer.\n\nA lot of places in the country have a claim on great beer right now. Even the Germans and Belgians will admit that the best beers in the world are being brewed by American craft brewers, and there are pockets of world-class excellence in California, Colorado, Ohio, Michigan \u2014 all over. But western New England, in my humble opinion, is the center of the beer universe.\n\nThat morning trek by the happy lady from New Jersey, and me, and all those other far-flung folks, was to get a beer called Heady Topper, which is considered by many to be the tastiest in the world. It\u2019s sold only within a few miles of its brewery in Waterbury, Vt., and it sells out within minutes of arriving at any of the stores to which the brewery delivers, so the effort to get a four-pack has become a hilariously hapless tourist route of people following around delivery trucks and trying to coax store owners into estimating the exact moment the booty might arrive.\n\nAnother fervently sought-after beer is brewed in Connecticut by a Vermont company called Lawson\u2019s Finest Liquids. The distribution of that one \u2014 it\u2019s called \u201cSip of Sunshine\u201d \u2014 is talked about online like leaked Beyonc\u00e9 tracks; people line up for hours ahead of time when a store announces it\u2019s getting cases, and by the time you make it to the front of the line, there\u2019s often a one-four-pack-per-person limit. People line up anyway.\n\nIn the scrappy little city of Worcester, Mass., Wormtown Brewery started making its award-winning beers a few years ago in an old ice cream parlor attached to a downtown restaurant. Now it\u2019s moving into a new facility that\u2019s 10 times larger. IPA all around!\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just beer. Everyone I know in western New England seems to be starting a small business, or growing their smaller one into a bigger one. With the help of a Small Business Association loan, the awesome old lakehouse in Ashfield, Mass., is becoming a significantly more awesome new lakehouse. New England\u2019s top-tier freshwater fishing is becoming a less-well-kept secret now that we\u2019re experiencing a minor explosion of world-class fishing guides and gear. Another friend has just started a magazine \u2014 yes, paper! \u2014 about the \u201cnew culture\u201d of New England. It wasn\u2019t hard to find either investors or advertisers. Did I mention it\u2019s a magazine on paper?\n\nPerhaps the clearest sign of what\u2019s going on is that the newest big new business in college-town Northampton is itself an incubator of new businesses. It\u2019s shared, flexible office space for entrepreneurs who need a temporary base. Demand was so great that it outgrew the old space and moved closer to the new Amtrak station that just started serving the downtown\u2019s first new commuter trains in a generation.\n\nIt is one thing to see the top-line numbers that say the economy is humming: economic growth at 5 percent, unemployment below 6 percent, the number of jobs created last year at a 15-year high. Beyond those numbers, though, it\u2019s that antiseptic, jargony phrase \u201cconsumer confidence\u201d that, at last, we\u2019re finally feeling.\n\nWestern New England is no Silicon Valley. We\u2019re not going to see huge concentrations of capital flooding into these little ventures, and we\u2019re not going to see rural small-business growth on the cover of the financial section anytime soon. But in a lot of far-flung corners of the country right now, you can see America\u2019s new economic optimism in small-scale local ambition. The National Federation of Independent Business says its Small Business Optimism Index is higher than at any point since years before the \u201cGreat Recession.\u201d That \u201csmall-business incubator\u201d idea that has proved so successful in Northampton is actually a new sector of business real estate that\u2019s taking off nationwide. The \u201cStartUp\u201d podcast is a hit. The Affordable Care Act remains a political football, but being able to take health insurance with you from job to job to self-employment has been a boon.\n\nThe perception that ingenuity and growth derive mostly from the tech sector has directed enormous amounts of money and political attention to places designated as tech centers. But if the economy really is back, the great challenge and opportunity of this time in our politics is to make sure it can come roaring back everywhere. Across the country, that makes for some very nonpartisan political imperatives. There has to be broadband, everywhere. If your town doesn\u2019t have high-speed Internet, it\u2019s like you\u2019ve jammed a cork in the prospect of local business innovation. Transportation has to work, not just for moving products around, but for quality of life, so that smart young people with options will choose your town to live and work. That means roads and bridges, but also prioritizing public transportation and walking and biking.\n\nThere will always be ideological disagreements about tax rates and regulations and the role of unions and the structure of health insurance and blah blah blah. But as we keep fighting those interminable fights, the economic resurgence we\u2019re experiencing right now is a moment we shouldn\u2019t waste. If local, state and national politicians can get together to make progress on basic infrastructure, and soon \u2014 which ought to be the most nonpartisan thing imaginable \u2014 the confident, ambitious, creative people of this country will do the rest.
