This tells us something about the Republican electorate.\n\nHistorically, these are obscure issues where mostly the beneficiaries care about them. But today, groups like Heritage Action and the Club for Growth and local Tea Party groups have been agitating against them as corporate welfare for the past three years or so. For Tea Partiers, corporate welfare embodies what's wrong with Washington \u2014 the insiders get rich unfairly, and the rest of us bear the cost and the risk.\n\nCruz building a campaign partly around this reminds us that he's aiming squarely at the Tea Party. More broadly, it reminds us that these days being the \"conservative\" candidate means doing battle, at times with the Chamber of Commerce and the business lobby. As other candidates jump officially into the race, they're going to need to show some bona fides on battling corporate welfare, too.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz is officially announcing his presidential campaign Monday, and one of the central focusses of his campaign website will be battling corporate welfare.\nHis homepage links to four policy areas where he cites his proven record.
