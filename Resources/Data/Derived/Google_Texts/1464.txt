Ohio’s Akron Beacon Journal profiles Green Party U.S. Senate candidate Joe DeMare, writing, “With a master’s degree in education, DeMare is one of the most educated machinists in Perrysburg.” If elected, DeMare “would push to replace the Affordable Care Act, a system of exchanges to purchase mandated private medical insurance, with universal health care by taxing billionaires ‘out of existence.'”

He says his “progressive tax plan, he argues, would balance income inequality. On social justice, he would parrot the demands of the Black Lives Matter movement. … But ecological restoration — ‘bringing the environment back to health, not just slowing its decline’ — is front and center on his political agenda. DeMare’s campaign website features a flier” with the candidate “smirking as global warming burns the world behind him. ‘Vote for me if you want to live!’ the ad says.”

In another article, the Beacon Journal writes that DeMare and the two independent candidates in the race “are long-shot candidates,” but “what they lack in viability they more than compensate for in the ability to alter the outcome of the election.”
