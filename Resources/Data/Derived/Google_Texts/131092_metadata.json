Unable to lead a majority of his own party, he will enter the final 18 months of his presidency badly weakened in the eyes of foreign powers and the U.S. public.\n\nSEE ALSO: Hillary Clinton: Obama should use trade fight to his advantage\n\n\u201cThe loss on the trade bill is a humiliating one for the Obama presidency,\u201d said Charles Lipson, a political science professor at the University of Chicago. \u201cIt tells you something about him and something about his party. Six years of ignoring the Hill and building no relationships there comes with a price. So does the president\u2019s low popularity. It means he cannot protect vulnerable members of his own party if they vote with him.\u201d\n\nThe blow also comes in a make-or-break month for Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy-building efforts. Besides trying to salvage the crucial trade deal, Mr. Obama is awaiting a decision by the Supreme Court that could unravel Obamacare, and he is racing against a June 30 deadline to reach a deal to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons ambitions.\n\nThe key roll call vote Friday came on a measure to grant financial aid to displaced workers, up to $450 million in annual assistance that Democrats have long championed. But 144 Democrats joined 158 Republicans in rejecting the measure, a stunning loss for the president that left the overall trade legislation in limbo.\n\nTop Republicans who allied with Mr. Obama on trade placed full blame on congressional Democrats. Rep. Paul Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, said Sunday that if the president loses clout as a legislative force, Democrats will be fully responsible.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats abandoned their president, the leader of their party, in droves on a bill and a program they demanded as part of this. To me, it was stunning that they would do this to the leader of their party,\u201d Mr. Ryan said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are the ones who are making him a very lame duck president, his own party,\u201d Mr. Ryan said.\n\nHouse Republican leaders, who support granting the president Trade-Promotion Authority, say they will try to bring up the matter for another vote by Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe are not done with this,\u201d said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, California Republican.\n\nSome analysts say the administration\u2019s stature on the world stage is hanging in the balance. Negotiations on sticking points of the sprawling Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed free trade pact with 11 other Pacific Rim nations including Japan and Australia, have slowed while the potential trading partners wait to see whether Mr. Obama will have the authority to conclude the agreement without major changes by Congress.\n\n\u201cIf TPA stays in limbo, it means that ongoing trade negotiations will become much more difficult,\u201d said Frances B. Smith, an analyst on trade issues at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. \u201cHow can countries negotiate in good faith with the U.S. when they know the specifics of their agreements can be pulled apart and dealt with separately rather than as a whole?\u201d\n\nThe setback put Mr. Obama\u2019s diminishing clout on full public display. He made two personal appeals to Democrats in the 24 hours leading up to Friday\u2019s vote, in addition to phone calls, and even hosted four lawmakers aboard Air Force One on a trip with him to Europe.\n\nThe president made an impromptu visit Thursday night to lawmakers playing in the annual congressional baseball game at Nationals Park, bearing a gift of White House-brewed beer. He mingled in the Democrats\u2019 dugout and greeted Republicans, who were chanting \u201cTPA!\u201d His friendly gestures toward the Republicans reportedly didn\u2019t sit well in the Democrats\u2019 dugout.\n\nMr. Obama followed up Friday morning with a trip to Capitol Hill to meet with the House Democratic caucus, his first such pep rally with his own party in two years. It was then that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California, one of the president\u2019s most important partners over more than six years of legislative battles, told him that she was leaning against the trade assistance measure.\n\nIn his meeting with Democratic lawmakers, Mr. Obama urged them to \u201cplay it straight\u201d and pleaded for their support. But he also offended some Democrats by saying he had the nation\u2019s best interests at heart and suggesting that lawmakers who opposed the trade measure were motivated by political considerations.\n\nMany Democrats view the trade measure as poisonous to their re-election chances next year because of constituents\u2019 concerns that U.S. jobs are being lost overseas.\n\nRep. Peter A. DeFazio, an Oregon Democrat who attended the meeting, said Mr. Obama \u201ctried to both guilt people and then impugn their integrity.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s ignored Congress and disrespected Congress for years and then he shows up at the baseball game with homemade beer, and then comes to the caucus and lectures us for 40 minutes about his values and whether or not we\u2019re being honest by using legislative tactics to try and stop something which we believe is a horrible mistake for the United States of America and questions our integrity,\u201d Mr. DeFazio told reporters afterward. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the greatest strategy.\u201d\n\nSaid Mr. Lipson, \u201cEven when President Obama tries to win votes, he personalizes and belittles the people on the other side.\u201d\n\nAs the president tries to forge some political momentum in this crucial month, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the rift with House Democrats on trade won\u2019t spill over into the president\u2019s other priorities. He noted that nearly all House Democrats signed a letter last month in support of Mr. Obama\u2019s efforts to reach a nuclear deal with Iran.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody who\u2019s suggested that that priority is going to be threatened just because we might have a disagreement over this particular issue,\u201d Mr. Earnest said Friday.\n\nBut Mr. Lipson said the trade vote has exposed deeper fissures in the Democratic Party\u2019s base heading into an election season.\n\n\u201cThe left is now firmly against free trade as part of their general view about free markets,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s odd about that is that the labor base of the Democratic Party is no longer in the private, manufacturing sector. It\u2019s public-sector unions, and they actually benefit from the lower prices associated with open markets. But the AFL-CIO had an internal log roll, bowing to the needs of the few remaining members in private-sector unions, and made it a litmus test.\u201d\n\nBoth the White House and House lawmakers who support the trade package pointed to another vote that gives them hope. The House voted 219-211 on the proposal to grant Mr. Obama fast-track authority, with 28 Democrats in favor.\n\nIn his weekly address Saturday, Mr. Obama urged the House to vote again quickly on the measure.\n\n\u201cFor the sake of those workers, their families and their communities, I urge those members of Congress who voted against trade adjustment assistance to reconsider and stand up for American workers,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThis is about the kind of country we want to build for our kids and our grandkids. And if I did not think that smart new trade deals were the right thing to do for working families, I wouldn\u2019t be fighting for it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "If President Obama somehow persuades dozens of Democratic lawmakers to change their minds by Tuesday night and vote with him on a second attempt to pass trade legislation, he will rescue an agreement that is designed to be the centerpiece of his foreign policy shift toward Asia.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "If President Obama somehow persuades dozens of Democratic lawmakers to change their minds by Tuesday night and vote with him on a second attempt to pass trade legislation, he will rescue an agreement that is designed to be the centerpiece of his foreign policy shift toward Asia.", "title": "Obama fights for Asia trade deal with relevance hanging in the balance", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/14/obama-fights-for-asia-trade-deal-with-relevance-ha/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/14/Obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/14/Obama.jpg", "description": "If President Obama somehow persuades dozens of Democratic lawmakers to change their minds by Tuesday night and vote with him on a second attempt to pass trade legislation, he will rescue an agreement", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama fights for Asia trade deal with relevance hanging in the balance"}, "Author": "Dave Boyer, Ben Wolfgang and Dave Boyer, Ben Wolfgang", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Barack Obama, Charles Lipson, Fast Track, Congress"}, "article_summary": "In his meeting with Democratic lawmakers, Mr. Obama urged them to \u201cplay it straight\u201d and pleaded for their support.\nTop Republicans who allied with Mr. Obama on trade placed full blame on congressional Democrats.\nBut if the defeat delivered by the House on Friday stands, Mr. Obama will lose much more than his desired Trade Promotion Authority.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s odd about that is that the labor base of the Democratic Party is no longer in the private, manufacturing sector.\nIn his weekly address Saturday, Mr. Obama urged the House to vote again quickly on the measure."}
