One of Zirkle\u2019s dogs also was injured. Iditarod officials at first reported King had been injured. But the four-time champion said later the snowmobile had missed both him and his sled.\n\nDemoski said when he woke up Saturday morning and heard what had happened to the mushers, he checked his snowmobile and realized he had done it. The snowmobile was missing a part and had rust-colored stains, he said.\n\nDemoski said he doesn\u2019t remember the collisions, which the Iditarod described as apparently intentional attacks.\n\n\u201cI just want to say I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said.\n\nZirkle, 46, who finished second three times from 2012 to 2014, was mushing from Kokukuk to Nulato, a run of less than 20 miles (32.19 kilometers) on the Yukon River, when she was hit, race marshal Mark Nordman said Saturday.\n\nThe snowmobile hit the side of Zirkle\u2019s sled about 5 miles (8.05 kilometers) outside of Koyukuk, turned around multiple times and came back at her before driving off, Alaska State Troopers spokeswoman Megan Peters said by email.\n\nThe snowmobile reappeared 12 miles (19.31 kilometers) outside of Nulato. The driver revved up and was pointed at Zirkle before leaving, Peters said.\n\nDemoski told KTUU that he did not return to harass Zirkle. He said he wanted to check to make sure she was OK.\n\nOne dog on Zirkle\u2019s team was bruised. Officials described the injury as non-life-threatening.\n\nZirkle reached Nulato and told a race official the incident had left her shaken.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really bad. Someone tried to kill me with a snowmachine,\u201d she said on a video posted to the Iditarod Insider webpage. Snowmachine is what Alaskans call snowmobiles.\n\nKing, a four-time Iditarod champion, was behind Zirkle and fared worse. When King reached the vicinity 12 miles outside of Nulato, his team was struck from behind by the snowmobile.\n\nNash, a 3-year-old male, was killed. Crosby, another 3-year-old male, and Banjo, a 2-year-old male, received injuries and are expected to survive. King told the Iditarod Insider the snowmobile narrowly missed him and his sled, but hit his dogs at high speed.\n\n\u201cOne of my dogs was killed pretty much on the spot, and a couple others I gave first aid to the best I could and loaded them into my sled,\u201d he told the Iditarod camera crew. \u201cI kind of felt like a triage ambulance.\u201d\n\nIt did not appear to be an accident, he said. \u201cIt seemed like an act of bravado,\u201d King said.\n\nRural Alaska communities have many wonderful people, he said, but they also have serious social problems.\n\n\u201cIt is beyond comprehension to me that this was not related to substance abuse,\u201d King said, adding that \u201cno one in their right mind would do what this person did.\u201d\n\nKing remained in Nulato early Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe race leader early Saturday afternoon was Brent Sass, who left the village of Kaltag at 8:20 a.m.\n\nZirkle rested four hours in Nulato and dropped one dog before heading back onto the Yukon River with 14 dogs in harness. She reached Kaltag at 10: 44 a.m., and after a nine-minute rest, left again in second place.\n\nCurrent champion Dallas Seavey left Kaltag at 11: 24 a.m. in third place. His father, former champion Mitch Seavey, was in fourth place.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE2LzAzL21hbi1hcnJlc3RlZC1pbi1jb25uZWN0aW9uLXdpdGgtaWRpdGFyb2QtY3Jhc2hlcy10aGF0LWtpbGxlZC1vbmUtZG9nLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Tommy Cummings", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "From The Associated Press ANCHORAGE, Alaska \u2014\u00a0A man suspected of intentionally driving a snowmobile into teams of two mushers near the front of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race was\u2026", "title": "Man arrested in connection with Iditarod crashes that killed one dog", "url": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2016/03/man-arrested-in-connection-with-iditarod-crashes-that-killed-one-dog.html/", "image": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/files/2016/03/dograce.jpg", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2016-03-12T23:00:26Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "PublishDate": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "viewport": "width=device-width", "google-site-verification": "ZjZz-aaVcLkLDp8kIkLnEwtSTZlAwGgQhLyd1pXAbA8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"publishtime": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ed0\"", "article_summary": "King told the Iditarod Insider the snowmobile narrowly missed him and his sled, but hit his dogs at high speed.\nFrom The Associated PressANCHORAGE, Alaska \u2014 A man suspected of intentionally driving a snowmobile into teams of two mushers near the front of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race was arrested Saturday in a Yukon River village.\nThe crashes killed one of King\u2019s dogs and injured at least two others.\nArnold Demoski, 26, of Nulato was arrested on suspicion of assault, reckless endangerment, reckless driving and six counts of criminal mischief.\nZirkle reached Nulato and told a race official the incident had left her shaken."}
