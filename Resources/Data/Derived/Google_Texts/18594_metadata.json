They then weighed those costs against the total av\u00ader\u00adage cost of low\u00adest-price gold and plat\u00adin\u00adum plans on the ex\u00adchanges, be\u00adfore sub\u00adsidies.\n\nGold and plat\u00adin\u00adum plans typ\u00adic\u00adally carry high\u00ader monthly premi\u00adums, with lower out-of-pock\u00adet costs. The re\u00adsearch\u00aders used those plans for their com\u00adpar\u00adis\u00adon be\u00adcause they pay a sim\u00adil\u00adar per\u00adcent\u00adage of health care costs com\u00adpared with their em\u00adploy\u00ader-sponsored coun\u00adter\u00adparts.

They have the op\u00adtion to not of\u00adfer em\u00adploy\u00ader-sponsored health in\u00adsur\u00adance pen\u00adalty free, in\u00adstead leav\u00ading their em\u00adploy\u00adees to buy in\u00addi\u00advidu\u00adal plans on Obama\u00adcare\u2019s ex\u00adchanges, pos\u00adsibly with the help of fed\u00ader\u00adal sub\u00adsidies. But if the busi\u00adnesses do de\u00adcide to of\u00adfer cov\u00ader\u00adage, their em\u00adploy\u00adees are no longer eli\u00adgible for fed\u00ader\u00adal sub\u00adsidies.\n\n\u201cThe plans we\u2019re see\u00ading in the ex\u00adchanges are com\u00adpet\u00adit\u00adive in terms of the ser\u00advices they provide at the cost they\u2019re list\u00ading,\u201d said Ben Is\u00adgur, dir\u00adect\u00ador of the Health Re\u00adsearch In\u00adsti\u00adtute.\n\nThe study com\u00adpares the total cost of the plans, and does not dif\u00adfer\u00aden\u00adti\u00adate for wheth\u00ader those costs are paid by an em\u00adploy\u00ader, an em\u00adploy\u00adee or sub\u00adsidies.\n\nThat lump-sum cal\u00adcu\u00adla\u00adtion leaves it un\u00adclear which plans \u2014 em\u00adploy\u00ader-sponsored or ex\u00adchange-pur\u00adchased \u2014 will cost cus\u00adtom\u00aders the most, as it does not at\u00adtempt to cal\u00adcu\u00adlate what an in\u00addi\u00advidu\u00adal would re\u00adceive in sub\u00adsidies or in em\u00adploy\u00ader con\u00adtri\u00adbu\u00adtions. Nor does it at\u00adtempt to cal\u00adcu\u00adlate how the health plans em\u00adploy\u00aders of\u00adfer af\u00adfect the wages they pay their work\u00aders.\n\nBut the total cost is im\u00adport\u00adant, the re\u00adsearch\u00aders say, be\u00adcause it is what cus\u00adtom\u00aders on the ex\u00adchanges watch most closely. Premi\u00adum prices, in\u00adsur\u00adance com\u00adpan\u00adies say, are the most im\u00adport\u00adant factor in a con\u00adsumer\u2019s health plan de\u00adcision. Ac\u00adcord\u00ading to a Price\u00adwa\u00adter\u00adhouse\u00adCoopers re\u00adport from last fall, 94 per\u00adcent of in\u00adsurers be\u00adlieved this, and cited it as the primary reas\u00adon they began to con\u00adtract with few\u00ader doc\u00adtors and hos\u00adpit\u00adals in an ef\u00adfort to rein in costs.\n\nSo how are the in\u00adsurers of\u00adfer\u00ading plans on the ex\u00adchanges keep\u00ading their costs down?\n\nIn part, the use of nar\u00adrow net\u00adworks, also known as high-per\u00adform\u00adance health plans, al\u00adlows in\u00adsur\u00adance com\u00adpan\u00adies to in\u00adcrease com\u00adpet\u00adi\u00adtion among doc\u00adtors and hos\u00adpit\u00adals by be\u00ading more se\u00adlect\u00adive about with which com\u00adpan\u00adies they in\u00adclude in their cov\u00ader\u00adage.\n\nCeci Con\u00adnolly, man\u00adaging dir\u00adect\u00ador of the Health Re\u00adsearch In\u00adsti\u00adtute, said even em\u00adploy\u00aders are look\u00ading at nar\u00adrow\u00ading their net\u00adworks to lower costs.\n\n\u201cWe an\u00adti\u00adcip\u00adate that the pub\u00adlic and private ex\u00adchanges are go\u00ading to con\u00adtin\u00adue to foster great\u00ader com\u00adpet\u00adi\u00adtion and on\u00adgo\u00ading pres\u00adsure to provide bet\u00adter value,\u201d Con\u00adnolly said. \u201cEvery\u00adone\u2019s go\u00ading to be able to look at what\u2019s out there and avail\u00adable on these ex\u00adchanges. I think em\u00adploy\u00aders will turn around and ask in\u00adsurers for sim\u00adil\u00adar good value, when they com\u00adpare plan of\u00adfer\u00adings and see if they\u2019re get\u00adting what they want for their money.\u201d\n\nHer con\u00adver\u00adsa\u00adtions with em\u00adploy\u00aders are backed up by data from the Kais\u00ader Fam\u00adily Found\u00ada\u00adtion which shows an up\u00adward trend in the use of nar\u00adrow net\u00adworks. While only 15 per\u00adcent of em\u00adploy\u00ader-sponsored health plans con\u00adtained a high-value per\u00adform\u00adance pro\u00advider in 2007, by 2013 that num\u00adber jumped to 23 per\u00adcent.\n\nSome pa\u00adtients have ex\u00adpressed frus\u00adtra\u00adtion with the trend, es\u00adpe\u00adcially when it means less ac\u00adcess to ser\u00advices and the loss of a fam\u00adily doc\u00adtor. But even in\u00adsur\u00adance com\u00adpan\u00adies could change their minds, Con\u00adnolly said, if they start to see that it\u2019s not a tradeoff con\u00adsumers are will\u00ading to make for a lower price.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re really go\u00ading to learn a lot about what con\u00adsumers want now that they really have this op\u00adpor\u00adtun\u00adity to choose from a lot of dif\u00adfer\u00adent plans,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd ul\u00adti\u00admately com\u00adpet\u00adi\u00adtion com\u00ading to health care is a good and healthy thing.\u201d\n\nPrice\u00adwa\u00adter\u00adhouse\u00adCoopers\u2019 Health Re\u00adsearch In\u00adsti\u00adtute is a non\u00adpar\u00adtis\u00adan health care con\u00adsult\u00ading and data ana\u00adlys\u00adis group.\n\n{{ BIZOBJ (video: 4711) }}", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "National Journal", "description": "A top consulting firm ran the numbers and found comparable health plans are 20 percent cheaper on the exchanges.", "title": "Study: Obamacare Is Cheaper Than Employer-Backed Plans", "url": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/health-care/2014/02/06/study-obamacare-is-cheaper-than-employer-backed-plans", "image": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/media/media/2013/12/23/health-insurance-sign-up.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "mxRH-jX1pR5MjoxIjXJOxnDElPR-loQvW49hc6LMh6w", "twitter": {"site": "@nationaljournal", "image": {"src": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/media/media/2013/12/23/health-insurance-sign-up.jpg"}, "description": "A top consulting firm ran the numbers and found comparable health plans are 20 percent cheaper on the exchanges.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Study: Obamacare Is Cheaper Than Employer-Backed Plans"}, "description": "A top consulting firm ran the numbers and found comparable health plans are 20 percent cheaper on the exchanges.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8f80\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAnd ul\u00adti\u00admately com\u00adpet\u00adi\u00adtion com\u00ading to health care is a good and healthy thing.\u201dPrice\u00adwa\u00adter\u00adhouse\u00adCoopers\u2019 Health Re\u00adsearch In\u00adsti\u00adtute is a non\u00adpar\u00adtis\u00adan health care con\u00adsult\u00ading and data ana\u00adlys\u00adis group.\nGold and plat\u00adin\u00adum plans cov\u00ader 80 per\u00adcent and 90 per\u00adcent re\u00adspect\u00adively of a par\u00adti\u00adcipant\u2019s health care costs, while on av\u00ader\u00adage em\u00adploy\u00ader-sponsored plans cov\u00ader 85 per\u00adcent of health costs.\nWhile only 15 per\u00adcent of em\u00adploy\u00ader-sponsored health plans con\u00adtained a high-value per\u00adform\u00adance pro\u00advider in 2007, by 2013 that num\u00adber jumped to 23 per\u00adcent.\nNor does it at\u00adtempt to cal\u00adcu\u00adlate how the health plans em\u00adploy\u00aders of\u00adfer af\u00adfect the wages they pay their work\u00aders.\nHealth plans on Obama\u00adcare\u2019s in\u00adsur\u00adance ex\u00adchanges will on av\u00ader\u00adage cost less than em\u00adploy\u00ader-sponsored cov\u00ader\u00adage, ac\u00adcord\u00ading to a new re\u00adport."}
