“Empire,” the ratings phenomenon and cultural touchstone of TV last season, returns for season 2 on Fox Sept. 23 (8 p.m. on KDVR-Channel 31) still addicting and with a number of hot guest stars.

In just the first few episodes, Marisa Tomei plays a corporate player with an eye for the girls while organizing a hostile takeover; Chris Rock plays (completely seriously!) a prison rival of Lucious Lyon (Terrence Howard); Chris “Ludacris” Bridges portrays over-confident prison Officer McKnight; Becky G plays a hot Latina singer; Andre Royo (“The Wire”) is wonderfully sleazy as a well connected lawyer, and Pitbull guest stars as himself.

No spoiler, but from the hint of a flashback, it looks like Kelly Rowland (formerly of Destiny’s Child) has a juicy subplot coming up.

The songs keep the story moving while the fashions, accessories and artworks keep up with the music. As the season opens with the episode “The Devils Are Here,” it’s three months since the arrest of Lucious at the end of last season and the head of Empire is trying to run the music company from inside a federal prison.

It’s not giving anything away to note that the song he records on a laptop in a supply closet, supposedly produced on rudimentary equipment smuggled into the prison, is an immediate hit.

If the scene-stealing, Emmy-nominated antics of Taraji P. Henson as Cookie Lyon were a focal point last season, the parade of guest stars is equally compelling this time around.
