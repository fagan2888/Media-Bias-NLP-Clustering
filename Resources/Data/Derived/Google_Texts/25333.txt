Lynn Liddle, the executive vice president of Domino’s Pizza, said the Obamacare mandate to count and post calories of served and sold food is impossible.

“Essentially, we think this rule is a kind of disaster for everybody,” she said, the Washington Free Beacon reported. “Not just pizza but restaurants, and anybody that’s going to fall within this law. It’s still not workable.”

The mandate — carried out by the Food and Drug Administration — requires that all restaurant chains post calorie information.

But that’s “impossible to comply,” the company said.

One big problem, Ms. Liddle said, JoeMiller.us reported: The rule expands the definition of menu.

“We no longer know what a menu is,” Ms. Liddle said. “It’s really hard to interpret. Essentially they’re saying anything that a consumer can look at and make a potential ordering decision from is a menu.”
