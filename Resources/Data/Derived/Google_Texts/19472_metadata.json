The GOP-led congress knows full well that the passage of the bill in Congress is symbolic because President Barack Obama is expected to veto it.\n\nNevertheless, the proponents of the bill will be fulfilling a promise to their base by laying the groundwork to effectively decimate Obama\u2019s 2010 healthcare reform law using a legislative strategy based on Senate rules and precedents, which would make it easier to repeal Obamacare under what they hope to be a Republican president in 2017.
