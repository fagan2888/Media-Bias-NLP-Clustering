At Republican club meetings, public rallies and on Twitter, she praised Mr. Cruz\u2019s tenacity and commitment to repealing the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNow, in her bid to unseat United States Representative Pete Sessions, 58, Republican of Dallas, Ms. Pierson is trying to convince voters that she possesses those same qualities and that Mr. Sessions does not. Ms. Pierson, 37, a political and media consultant, said she decided last year to challenge Mr. Sessions after she attended several meetings between him and activists.\n\n\u201cEverything became \u2018next time\u2019 basically \u2014 next debt ceiling fight, next continuing resolution,\u201d Ms. Pierson said. \u201cPeople seem to forget this nation wasn\u2019t founded on going along to get along.\u201d\n\nShe and her supporters are drawing parallels between her effort and Mr. Cruz\u2019s successful campaign. While Mr. Cruz surprised many when he won an open Senate seat, Ms. Pierson has the trickier task of trying to unseat a powerful incumbent. Mr. Sessions has served in Congress since 1997 and is the chairman of the House Rules Committee. He declined a request to comment for this article.\n\nThough she trails Mr. Sessions in fund-raising, Ms. Pierson\u2019s campaign has been gaining some momentum by leveraging her ties to the national Tea Party movement. She has drawn endorsements from Michelle Malkin, the conservative blogger, and Matt Kibbe, the president of FreedomWorks, a libertarian advocacy group.\n\nThis month, Ms. Pierson gained the support of Rafael Cruz, Mr. Cruz\u2019s father. Though Senator Cruz has said he was not picking sides in the race, he described Ms. Pierson as \u201can utterly fearless principled conservative\u201d at a recent conservative rally.\n\nMs. Pierson made clear she planned to treat the comments as an endorsement. \u201cWe\u2019re going to send that out and let everybody know that the senator has not forgotten those who were in the trenches with him,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor Ms. Pierson, a run for office is the latest step in her growing immersion into Texas politics.\n\nSoon after attending her first Tea Party meeting in 2009, she found herself a leader in the nascent movement, holding advisory roles in several groups and explaining Tea Party positions on cable news. Last year, she left a career in health care administration to start Pierson Consulting Group, a political and media consulting firm. She declined to identify any current or former clients.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Ms. Pierson and her supporters have described Mr. Sessions as a creature of Washington out of touch with Texans. They have argued that he has not sufficiently supported efforts, led largely by Mr. Cruz, to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn an email, Torrie Miller, a spokeswoman for Mr. Sessions\u2019s campaign, described \u201cdismantling Obamacare\u201d as a priority. \u201cCongressman Sessions has broad and deep grass-roots support across the 32nd Congressional District of Texas,\u201d Ms. Miller said.\n\nMs. Pierson has also questioned Mr. Sessions\u2019s ties to his Dallas district, accusing him of having moved to Florida. In 2012, Mr. Sessions married Karen Diebel, a former Florida congressional candidate. The couple owns a house near Orlando, though Mr. Sessions listed a Dallas apartment as his address when he filed for re-election.\n\nMr. Sessions said in an emailed statement that he still lived in Dallas, though he also spent time in Florida.\n\n\u201cMy wife and I are working hard to make our combined families work well,\u201d Mr. Sessions said. \u201cWith five boys living in four cities and the two of us working in three different cities, it is clearly a balancing act.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140118204407, "twitter": {"description": "Katrina Pierson, a
