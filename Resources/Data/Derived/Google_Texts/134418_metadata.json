Catholic charities were immediately in an uproar, knowing that this would like result in a provision for free contraception as part of the recently-passed Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn addition to Catholic institutions, evangelical organizations were also sounding the alarm bells. \u201cYet another untruth about Obamacare has been uncovered,\u201d said Richard Land, head of the Southern Baptist Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, on July 20. \u201cHHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has recommended mandatory coverage for \u2018emergency contraception,\u2019 which is a euphemism for the morning-after pill, which often kills a newly conceived child by not allowing the embryo to implant on the wall of the mother\u2019s womb.\u201d\n\nLand\u2019s strong words mark the first major evangelical objection to the contraception mandate. By the Spring of 2012, evangelicals were the only major religious group where a majority opposed the mandate, according to a Public Religion Research Institute Poll. But the evangelical anti-contraception-mandate movement didn\u2019t gain widespread attention until Hobby Lobby filed a lawsuit against Sebelius, announced in September 2012. Hobby Lobby founder David Green argued that his company was founded on pro-life Christian principles, and thus should be exempt from the mandate. \u201cBeing Christians, we don\u2019t pay for drugs that might cause abortions. Which means that we don\u2019t cover emergency contraception, the morning-after pill or the week-after pill. We believe doing so might end a life after the moment of conception, something that is contrary to our most important beliefs.\u201d\n\nThe Hobby Lobby lawsuit encouraged other evangelicals to join the battle against the mandate. Lawsuits opposing the mandate, which had previously been filed mainly by Catholic groups, were now being filed by evangelical businesses and universities. Evangelical publishing giant Tyndale House sued Sebelius, followed by three Baptist universities, The American Family Association, and Guidestone Financial Resources (which provides health insurance to Southern Baptist Convention employees.)\n\nWith the Hobby Lobby\u2019s case to be decided by the Supreme Court in June, many Americans are still confused about the evangelical role in this fight. Unlike Catholics, evangelicals have not historically been known for their opposition to birth control, and yet, most journalists seem to have taken conservative evangelicals at their word, assuming that if evangelicals say they have always been opposed to birth control, it must be true.\n\nThe reality is much more complicated. Technically, evangelicals have been opposed to certain forms of birth control ever since they came to believe life begins at conception. Before the mid- to late-1970s, evangelicals actually had a generally pro-choice attitude, according to Jonathan Dudley, author of \u201cBroken Words: The Abuse of Science and Faith in American Politics.\u201d Dudley pointed to a 1968 document produced at an evangelical conference co-sponsored by Christianity Today and the Christian Medical and Dental Association that said, \u201cWhether the performance of an induced abortion is sinful we are not agreed, but about the necessity of it and permissibility for it under certain circumstances we are in accord. \u2026 When principles conflict, the preservation of fetal life \u2026 may have to be abandoned to maintain full and secure family life.\u201d\n\nWhen evangelicals finally got on the pro-life bandwagon on the mid to late 1980s, they adopted much of the pre-existing pro-life ideology, which had been created by Catholic pro-lifers. According to Dudley, \u201cWhen evangelicals joined the movement full-force in the late 1970s, Catholics had already established what it meant to be \u201cpro-life\u201d in the political world. And being \u201cpro-life\u201d meant believing life begins at conception.\u201d\n\nFor Catholics, these pro-life ideas went hand-in-hand with a rejection of birth control, a notion that some evangelicals embraced as well. Catholics believed that anything that prevented children from being born was a violation of God\u2019s will. Some evangelicals adopted a different but related idea, believing that, since life begins at conception, forms of birth control that could prevent a fertilized egg from implanting were essentially abortions or \u201cabortifacients.\u201d This idea was the basis for opposition to the pill in the 1970s (when the scientific consensus was that the pill could prevent implantation, a consensus that has been challenged today) and to Plan B, Ella, and IUDs today. Bruce Prescott, minister author of the blog \u201cMainstream Baptist,\u201d encountered this idea in 1979, which led him and his wife to switch birth control methods. (Although he no longer supports this idea today.)\n\nStill, the idea that birth control was abortive was rarely talked about among evangelicals, even though the idea that life begins at conception was doctrine at places like the Southern Baptist Convention. \u201cIt is evident,\u201d wrote Southern Baptist Ethics Professor Kenneth Magnuson in 2003, \u201cthat there is no well-defined evangelical position on contraception.\u201d Others went further. Dr. Allan Carlson of Hillsdale College noted in a 2012 New York Times article that \u201cas recently as \u201c10 or 20 years ago,\u201d rejection of birth control \u201cwould have been an immediate no\u201d for nearly all Protestants.\u201d As recently as 2008, evangelical pastor Mark Driscoll argued that \u201ceven Focus on the Family and the Christian Medical and Dental Associations (CMDA) are undecided on the issue \u2026 As a result, it seems legalistic and inappropriate to declare that use of the pill is sinful.\u201d Polls in 2009 and 2010 showed that 90% of evangelical leaders and the evangelical populace viewed birth control as morally acceptable.\n\nThis was even the case in the ultraconservative Southern Baptist Convention, according to Prescott. \u201cMost Southern Baptists don\u2019t know that they have issues with birth control.\u201d The idea that life begins at conception was written into the Southern Baptist faith statement in 2000, but Prescott notes that most Southern Baptists probably saw this as narrowly prohibiting abortion. \u201cPeople in the pews didn\u2019t have a clue what the significance was \u2014 that it would prohibit stem cells and contraception.\u201d\n\nThere was thus a direct disconnect between doctrine and practice. And evangelical leaders largely seemed content with this. Some leaders occasionally griped about the evangelical community\u2019s laissez-faire attitude on birth control, but most were apparently equally guilty of this. To the extent that an anti-contraception movement existed before 2011, it was a popular one: evangelicals have no official source of opinion like the Pope, and thus anti-birth control views moved throughout evangelism from the bottom up. Evangelical sub-movements like the Quiverfull movement, which eschews all forms of birth control, played an important role in articulating evangelical anti-birth control beliefs, but they were far from the only ones to do so. Many took issue not only with the \u201cabortifacient\u201d nature of birth control, but also believed that it potentially encouraged promiscuity and treated children as a problem rather than a gift from God.\n\nAbby Norman, a Southern Baptist and writer of the blog \u201cAccidental Devotional\u201d, experienced these beliefs firsthand. In 2006, women in her church discussion group told her birth control was abortive and recommended that she read the 2001 book \u201cLies Women Believe,\u201d which Norman said convinced most of her church group to stop using hormonal birth control. \u201cLies Women Believe,\u201d written by conservative Christian Radio Host Nancy Leigh DeMoss, has sold over half a million copies and spawned two \u201ccompanion guides\u201d to the book.\n\nDeMoss claims that the destructive influence of feminism is largely responsible for the wide use of birth control among Christians. \u201cOne of the fundamental tenets of feminist ideology has always been the right of a woman to determine for herself if and when she will have children and how many children she will have\u2026the Christian world has been unwittingly influenced by this way of thinking, leading to the legitimization and promotion of such practices as contraception, sterilization, and family planning. As a result, unwittingly, millions of Christian women and couples have helped further Satan\u2019s attempts to limit human reproduction and thereby destroy life.\u201d\n\nDeMoss quotes Quiverfull activist and famous anti-feminist Mary Pride, who said, \u201cFamily planning is the mother of abortion\u2026once couples began to look upon children as creatures of their own making, who they could plan into their lines as they chose or not, all reverence for human life was lost.\u201d (As a side note, the idea that birth control encourages abortion \u2014 which is frequently repeated point in the birth control debate \u2014 is actually patently untrue. As Dudley notes, \u201c several scientific studies\u201d show ready availability of birth control has been shown to limit abortions. )", "article_metadata": {"description": "For three decades, the anti-contraception movement failed to catch on with evangelicals.
