(Photo: Mark Humphrey / AP) Story Highlights Thank you to the women who stand up and brave the public exposure of their private hell.\n\nYou, hopefully, make the future better for all sexual assault victims.\n\nIf you want to get a glimpse of how brave women need to be when they stand up for justice in sexual assault cases, just read some of the comments posted on The Tennessean\u2019s stories about Fox Sports reporter Erin Andrews\u2019 civil suit against the owners and operator of Marriott Nashville on West End over videos that were taken in the hotel by a stalker.\n\nThe Tennessean does not allow anonymous commenting, so the disgusting nature of what some people are willing to write is probably just an inkling of the insensitivity and lack of empathy that seethe in our communities.\n\nI wonder how these people would react to gross violations of their daughter\u2019s privacy, or if she were sexually assaulted? Would they blame her, the victim, for the assault? Tell her to keep quiet to avoid shame and stigma? Tell her that the best thing to do is just move on and forget about it?\n\nOr could they be strong and stand behind her and support her as she confronts again, and again, the indignity forced upon her?\n\nI hope, for their daughters\u2019 sakes, they never have to find out.\n\nStrong precedent\n\nThe Andrews trial was the second high-profile sexual violence case in Nashville in the past year.\n\nIn January 2015, two former Vanderbilt University football players were convicted by a jury in the rape of a fellow student \u2014 the conviction was set aside by a judge when the impartiality of a juror, a victim of statutory rape, was questioned by the defense lawyers, and a new trial is set for later this year.\n\nIn that trial, the woman also took the stand to testify before a jury who had watched humiliating video evidence.\n\nThe trials are high profile because of the popularity of either the victim, in Andrews\u2019 case, or the accused, in the football players\u2019 case, but they also are high profile because they are so rare.\n\nCrimes of sexual violence are rarely prosecuted because evidence is too often \u201cshe said, he said,\u201d and it is near impossible for victims to stand up to the pain and ignominy of a public trial.\n\nThe lawsuit brought by eight former University of Tennessee, Knoxville, students lists the plaintiffs as \u201cJane Doe.\u201d\n\nThe \u201congoing situation\u201d of whether Rep. Jeremy Durham, R-Franklin, may or may not have harassed several women is fueled by the fear of publicity and retribution, according to reporting in The Tennessean.\n\nNashville YWCA CEO Patricia Shea, whose agency deals with the impact of domestic and sexual violence every day, said, \u201cVictims like Erin Andrews, who are able to rally resources and publicly stand up to those who bully and abuse women, should be commended.\n\n\u201cAlthough Ms. Andrews continues to be victimized every time the video is played or someone claims she wasn\u2019t harmed, successful litigations are empowering and blaze a trail for other women to follow,\u201d Shea added. \u201cBy standing up for herself, Ms. Andrews stood up for all women who today cannot due to a lack of resources or fear of repercussions.\u201d\n\nBeing brave\n\nAfter the first Vanderbilt rape trial, the woman issued a statement that bears repeating \u2026 often:\n\n\u201cI want to remind other victims of sexual violence, you are not alone. You are not to blame.\u201d\n\nAndrews had a similar message during her civil trial.\n\n\u201cI have to do what\u2019s right,\u201d Andrews testified in her suit against the owners and operator of the Marriott Nashville on West End.\n\n\u201cAnd I have to stand up for myself. And I have to stand up for everyone,\u201d she added. \u201cThis could have happened to anyone. I want the Nashville Marriott held responsible.\"\n\nIn opening statements, Randall Kinnard, Andrews\u2019 attorney, captured the essence of sexual crimes when he referred to the impact the videos have on his client.\n\n\u201cIt happens, it continues to happen, it happens today, it will never stop,\u201d Kinnard said. \u201cThis is not like a broken arm that heals.\u201d\n\nThe jury awarded Andrews $55 million in damages.\n\nMindful\n\nIn an excellent Sports Illustrated article by Richard Deitsch, baseball broadcast reporter Trenni Kusnierek commented on the Andrews trial, \u201cMen are still dismissing what happened to her and making light of it and making a joke of her trauma.\n\n\u201cThat stuck out the most to me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt reinforces this feeling that the onus is on the victim to prove she was victimized.\u201d\n\nReach Frank Daniels III at 615-881-7039 and on Twitter @fdanielsiii\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1pn5k1P", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Thank you to the women who stand up and brave the public exposure of their private hell.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Thank you to the women who stand up and brave the public exposure of their private hell.", "title": "Erin Andrews, others stand up for all victims", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/columnists/frank-daniels/2016/03/12/erin-andrews-others-stand-up-all-victims/81526822/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Thank you to the women who stand up and brave the public exposure of their private hell.", "creator": "@tennessean", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5420ce7b9888c7c6e70dc96907acd08f023a6968/c=843-0-3381-2538&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/03/02/Nashville/Nashville/635925212807142692-Sportscaster-Lawsuit-jbuitrago-tennessean.com-6.jpg", "title": "Erin Andrews, others stand up for all victims", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Erin Andrews", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Erin Andrews", "title": "Erin Andrews, others stand up for all victims", "author": "Frank Daniels III", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/columnists/frank-daniels", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fd53921e8ab5b44f0210fdc4eb28101521cb8089/c=985-0-2889-2538/local/-/media/2016/03/02/Nashville/Nashville/635925212807142692-Sportscaster-Lawsuit-jbuitrago-tennessean.com-6.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e2529599d7edb91a87acb4c1fa9193ebebcb3801/c=843-0-3381-2538/local/-/media/2016/03/02/Nashville/Nashville/635925212807142692-Sportscaster-Lawsuit-jbuitrago-tennessean.com-6.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fee9d5763dc63784ab32360e17f5b4dfe3cc403c/c=4-0-3380-2538/local/-/media/2016/03/02/Nashville/Nashville/635925212807142692-Sportscaster-Lawsuit-jbuitrago-tennessean.com-6.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7b5408f1c807cdf52a7cee2725e88f86e181e9c8/c=0-0-3381-1910&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2016/03/02/Nashville/Nashville/635925212807142692-Sportscaster-Lawsuit-jbuitrago-tennessean.com-6.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-03-12T21:24:46.983000-06:00", "shorthed": "Erin Andrews, others stand up for all victims", "articleid": 81526822, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/611cdcf208ae98e79d8f7aed71cf18c0da4e3d69/c=0-0-3381-1910/local/-/media/2016/03/02/Nashville/Nashville/635925212807142692-Sportscaster-Lawsuit-jbuitrago-tennessean.com-6.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/487aef620ee1ec9190616b98cc9ee0227ee3eac6/c=883-0-2304-2538/local/-/media/2016/03/02/Nashville/Nashville/635925212807142692-Sportscaster-Lawsuit-jbuitrago-tennessean.com-6.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Erin Andrews, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, sexual assault, Nashville news, Fox News, YWCA"}, "article_summary": "Strong precedentThe Andrews trial was the second high-profile sexual violence case in Nashville in the past year.\nSportscaster and television host Erin Andrews, center, stands as the jury enters the courtroom Wednesday, March 2, 2016, in Nashville.\nNashville YWCA CEO Patricia Shea, whose agency deals with the impact of domestic and sexual violence every day, said, \u201cVictims like Erin Andrews, who are able to rally resources and publicly stand up to those who bully and abuse women, should be commended.\n(Photo: Mark Humphrey / AP) Story Highlights Thank you to the women who stand up and brave the public exposure of their private hell.\n\u201cThis is not like a broken arm that heals.\u201dThe jury awarded Andrews $55 million in damages."}
