But make the same assumption in one of the new health law plans, and it could lead to costly surprises.\n\nInsurance exchange customers who opt for convenience by automatically renewing their coverage for 2015 are likely to receive dated and inaccurate financial aid amounts from the government, say industry officials, advocates and other experts.\n\nIf those amounts are too low, consumers could get sticker shock over their new premiums. Too high, and they\u2019ll owe the tax man later.\n\nAutomatic renewal was supposed to make the next open-enrollment under President Barack Obama\u2019s health care overhaul smooth for consumers.\n\nBut unless the administration changes its 2015 approach, \u201cthey\u2019re setting people up for large and avoidable premium increases,\u201d said researcher Caroline Pearson, who follows the health law for the market analysis firm Avalere Health.\n\nIt could be a new twist on an old public relations headache for the White House: You keep the health plan you like but get billed way more.\n\n\u201cIt was our preference for (the administration) to have the capacity to update people\u2019s subsidy information, but they haven\u2019t been able to get that built,\u201d said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for the industry trade group America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans.\n\nHere\u2019s the issue, in a nutshell:\n\nTo streamline next year\u2019s open enrollment season, the Health and Human Services Department recently proposed offering automatic renewal to 8 million consumers who are already signed up.\n\nBut the fine print of the HHS announcement said consumers who auto enroll will get the \u201cthe exact dollar amount\u201d of financial aid they are receiving this year.\n\nThat\u2019s likely to be a problem for a couple of reasons, not to mention inflation.\n\nFirst, financial aid is partly based on premiums for a current benchmark plan in the community where the consumer lives. Because more plans are joining the market and insurers are submitting entirely new bids for 2015, the benchmark in many communities will be different.\n\nSecond, financial aid is also based on household income. If your income goes down, you are entitled to a bigger health insurance tax credit. If it goes up, you get less. The 2014 amounts could well be out of date and incorrect for many people. Financial assistance is also affected by age, family size and where people live.\n\nAnd that doesn\u2019t get into another motivation for consumers to shop around: Premiums and choices for 2015 are changing, so your current plan may no longer be a good deal.\n\n\u201cJust continuing in the same plan with the same credit is not going to be the optimal outcome for most people,\u201d said Judy Solomon of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which advocates for low-income people. \u201cYour 2014 credit is going to be lower in most cases, and in some cases it could be too high.\u201d\n\nAbout 8 in 10 of those who signed up for private coverage under the health care law are getting financial aid. In the 36 states served by the federal insurance exchange, the tax credits average $264 a month, reducing the average monthly premium of $346 to just $82.\n\nEven with such generous subsidies, about 4 in 10 who bought a health law plan say they have trouble paying their premiums, according to a poll by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nOpen enrollment starts Nov. 15, and consumers who already have a policy will have just about a month to renew or make changes to avoid a break in coverage Jan. 1. Millions of new customers are also expected to try to sign up for the first time.\n\nNew Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell is hoping that auto renewal will simplify things, a welcome change from this year\u2019s website problems.\n\nBut the subsidy scheme created by Congress to keep premiums affordable has so many moving parts that it\u2019s turning out to be difficult for the government to administer.\n\nAdministration spokesman Aaron Albright says all consumers are encouraged to contact their health insurance exchange to update any changes in personal and financial details. You can do that at any time, before the open-enrollment crunch.\n\nHowever, you will have to wait until the fall to change to a new plan for next year.\n\nEven if the financial aid amounts are off the mark, some advocates say auto renewal is still a safeguard to keep some people from falling through the cracks.\n\n\u201cIt is not a perfect solution, but I\u2019m not sure that there is a better solution in terms of protecting people so they don\u2019t lose health coverage,\u201d said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, an advocacy group supporting the overhaul.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Insurance exchange customers who opt for convenience by automatically renewing their coverage for 2015 are likely to receive dated and inaccurate financial aid amounts from the government, say industry officials, advocates and other experts.", "pubdate": 20140727, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Insurance exchange customers who opt for convenience by automatically renewing their coverage for 2015 are likely to receive dated and inaccurate financial aid amounts from the government, say industry officials, advocates and other experts.", "title": "Why automatic renewal of 2015 health coverage may backfire", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Doctor-Patient-01.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/plan-simplify-2015-health-renewals-may-backfire/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Insurance exchange customers who opt for convenience by automatically renewing their coverage for 2015 are likely to receive dated and inaccurate financial aid amounts from the government, say industry officials, advocates and other experts.", "creator": "@newshour", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Doctor-Patient-01.jpg", "title": "Why automatic renewal of 2015 health coverage may backfire", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "insurance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, health care, health insurance, insurance"}, "article_summary": "But make the same assumption in one of the new health law plans, and it could lead to costly surprises.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 If you have health insurance on your job, you probably don\u2019t give much thought to each year\u2019s renewal.\nBut unless the administration changes its 2015 approach, \u201cthey\u2019re setting people up for large and avoidable premium increases,\u201d said researcher Caroline Pearson, who follows the health law for the market analysis firm Avalere Health.\nAutomatic renewal was supposed to make the next open-enrollment under President Barack Obama\u2019s health care overhaul smooth for consumers.\nIf your income goes down, you are entitled to a bigger health insurance tax credit."}
