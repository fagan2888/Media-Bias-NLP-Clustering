Committee on the Rights of the Child to Reuters.\n\nFatwas are religious decrees made by muftis (experts in Islamic Sharia law) that are similar to Supreme Court rulings. All religious Muslims are supposed to follow a fatwa, if it is determined to be well-founded, however it is up to the individual to determine whether or not they will respect the decree. There is no definitive set of requirements that a mufti must follow in order to be allowed to make a fatwa, however the individual must have a strong knowledge of Sharia law, the Koran, and the Hadith (traditions of Muhammad).\n\nFollow Russ Read on Twitter\n\nClick here for reuse options!
