Avalanche center John Mitchell (head) and winger Jamie McGinn (back) did not participate in the on-ice activities during Friday’s opening day of training camp, but coach Patrick Roy said both are day to day.

Mitchell participated in a captain’s practice Wednesday but is suffering from migraines, unrelated to the concussion that kept him out of the playoffs in April, Roy said.

Captain Gabe Landeskog, Ryan O’Reilly, Max Talbot and Jan Hejda were full participants. Roy said Thursday each player was questionable with injuries.

Camp structure. Roy and his staff designed a camp to get good looks at all 67 participating players, comprising four teams — Burgundy, Blue, Black and Grey — in two sessions over more than four hours.

In each session, two teams do drills on the south rink at Family Sports Center before scrimmaging on their regular practice rink in three 15-minute periods.

Blue beat Burgundy 4-3 in a shootout in the opening scrimmage. Landeskog had the opening goal for Burgundy, against goalie Semyon Varlamov, but Varlamov stopped all three shots in the shootout to beat the Reto Berra-backed Burgundy.

O’Reilly scored in the shootout on Berra, who went on to stop Matt Duchene and Zach Redmond. Landeskog, Joey Hishon and Alex Tanguay couldn’t get pucks past Varlamov.

The Black beat the Grey 4-1 in the second scrimmage. Roy said Friday’s winners will face each other Saturday in a championship-type setting, while Friday’s losers play in the other game.

Bleackley impresses coach. Duchene centered O’Reilly and 18-year-old Conner Bleackley in Friday’s first scrimmage. Bleackley got lit up in the neutral zone by defenseman Gabriel Beaupre, but Roy said he was impressed with the 2014 first-round draft pick.
