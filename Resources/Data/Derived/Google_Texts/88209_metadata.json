They survived, which should make them the \u201clucky\u201d ones, but the moniker smacks of indecency.\n\nThree were transported to area hospitals and released relatively quickly. Three others \u2014 Michka Kebeya, Platini Namputu and Dickson Mandiki \u2014 died in the four-vehicle crash. Kebeya was Lusemo\u2019s husband. The couple and their five-year-old son had only been in Iowa about two months.\n\nAll of the carpool occupants were relatively new residents to the U.S., having immigrated from the central African nation of Congo as part of the Diversity Visa program. Participating in that program\u2019s lottery, they had received permanent resident cards through the U.S. State Department.\n\nLusemo, 32, and Baketela, 35, speaking through translators, said they don\u2019t remember the accident or its immediate aftermath. That\u2019s probably a blessing.\n\n\u201cWe found him (Baketela) at St. Luke\u2019s Hospital in Cedar Rapids. We didn\u2019t know where he was, and he was unconscious,\u201d explained Danny Mpoyi, a member of the close-knit Congolese community in the Cedar Rapids and Iowa City area.\n\nLusemo and Mbambi, 34, had been transported too, although who initially went where is fuzzy. Such specific details got lost in the shuffle as the Congolese community scrambled to ensure the care of children, made life support decisions, arranged emergency medical insurance and went about the grim task of honoring and burying their other three friends.\n\nOnce stabilized, the three seriously injured survivors were transported to University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City, where each underwent multiple surgeries. They were later moved to Covenant Medical Center in Waterloo, where they stayed until April 1 \u2014 the day after their emergency Medicaid expired.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t feel I was ready to be discharged,\u201d Lusemo said, while noting her appreciation for all of her medical caregivers following the accident. \u201cIt\u2019s still very difficult.\u201d\n\nWhile those injured were covered by emergency Medicaid, the Congolese community made arrangements for new medical insurance under the Affordable Care Act, said Peter Nkumu, who serves as the organization\u2019s president. That insurance took effect on April 1, the day the three were discharged.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t prepared (for them to be discharged),\u201d Nkumu said. \u201cOnly a few pieces were in place so that we could help them continue with their rehabilitation. We\u2019re struggling with transportation, with living expenses and more.\u201d\n\nThis past weekend the Congolese community rented a two-bedroom Cedar Rapids apartment, shared by Lusemo and Baketela. Mbambi has relatives in Cedar Rapids and was able to move in with them while she continues to heal.\n\nAll three have a long road of recovery ahead.\n\nThe two women, Lusemo and Mbambi, suffered similar life-threatening injuries, mostly to their neck and pelvic regions. Baketela\u2019s worst injury was to his left side, primarily hip to foot. They are all confined to wheelchairs, have no mobility and little ability to care for themselves.\n\n\u201cI can stand for short periods of time, but only if I am holding something for balance,\u201d said Baketela, who struggles with nerve damage.\n\nLusemo, who cannot stand at all, sees her five-year-old son every one or two weeks. He continues to live with a very generous support staffer from his Cedar Rapids elementary school until his mother can care for him and herself. At the time of her husband\u2019s funeral, she had just gotten off life support.\n\nBaketala\u2019s plans to reunite with his fiance and their infant daughter have been indefinitely postponed. He came to the U.S. when his daughter was a week old, and she and her mother are still in Congo. Because Baketela is unable to work or care for himself, immigration officials are hesitant to bring his family stateside.\n\n\u201cI cannot care for myself, how can I care for my family?\u201d he asks.\n\nThere is currently no estimate on when the two will recover enough to return to work, or if permanent damage may require new job skills training.\n\n\u201cI came to this country and Iowa with a dream,\u201d Lusemo said. \u201cThe accident and these events have certainly dimmed that dream, but it still is there. I still want to realize it.\u201d\n\nBaketela agrees. \u201cGod permitted this to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, am not sure I ever will. But there\u2019s no one to blame for this; it has not taken away my joy for having an opportunity to make my life here. I\u2019m looking forward to moving on with my plans.\u201d\n\nThe Congolese community in Iowa is relatively small, about 300 families on the eastern side of the state. Many are focused on stabilizing themselves in their new country, and don\u2019t have a great deal of extra resources for charity. Still, the community has come together to provide funerals and burials for the three members who died in the accident. They have stood by the injured members too, helping them navigate their medical needs.\n\nBut the truth is that those needs are outpacing the community\u2019s resources. Members who work are unable to offer transportation to and from doctor\u2019s appointments. Providing even the bare minimum of necessities for Lusemo and Baketela is expensive.\n\nReaders interested in helping, please reach out to me and I will place you in direct contact with Nkumu and Mpoyi of the Congolese community.\n\n\u2022 Comments: @LyndaIowa, (319) 339-3144, lynda.waddington@thegazette.com", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | They had only been in the United States for a few weeks when an encounter with a patch of ice in the early morning hours of Feb. 4 changed everything.
