Dianne Feinstein appeared on CBS\u2019 Face the Nation yesterday in part to face the music. Bob Schieffer led off this portion of her appearance by noting that the Obama administration has failed to deliver on many promises of ObamaCare, not the least of which was \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep your plan.\u201d Feinstein tries to explain that the promise was true \u2026 up until the bill passed.\n\nNo, seriously (via Eliana Johnson at The Corner):\n\nSCHIEFFER: The president said in the beginning that one thing was that if you liked the health care program you had, you could keep it. We now know there was debate within the administration before he said that as to whether that was actually a promise that could be kept. Should the president not have made that statement? FEINSTEIN: Well, as I understand it, you can keep it up to the time \u2014 and I hope this is correct, but this is what I\u2019ve been told \u2014 up to the time the bill was enacted, and after that, it\u2019s a different story. That part of it, if true, was never made clear.\n\nSo let\u2019s get this straight. The promise made by Barack Obama from 2007 forward all the way through the 2012 election, made dozens if not hundreds of times in those five years, meant that you could keep the plan you liked only if we never enacted the reform he proposed? I\u2019ve heard some pretty fanciful spin on the \u201ckeep your plan\u201d promise, but that really does take the cake. \u201cNever made clear,\u201d indeed.\n\nHere\u2019s another question for Senator Feinstein. You voted for this bill and helped push it through Congress with zero Republican votes. Why is it only now that we find out that you had no idea how this bill, drafted in the Senate by senior Democratic leadership, would impact Americans who liked the insurance they already had? Why did it take Senator Feinstein, a senior member of Democratic leadership on Capitol Hill herself, more than three and a half years to figure this out \u2014 and not even to a certainty, if one is to believe this spin cycle yesterday on CBS News?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Promises, promises.", "title": "Feinstein: Hey, you could have kept your plan \u2026 until we enacted ObamaCare", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/11/04/feinstein-hey-you-could-have-kept-your-plan-until-we-enacted-the-obamacare-bill/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/UDt1plYvx7w/0.jpg", "identifier": "http://img.youtube.com/vi/UDt1plYvx7w/0.jpg"}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-04T13:01:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-04T15:06:15+00:00"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama, Bob Schieffer, Dianne Feinstein, keep your plan, like your plan, ObamaCare,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce05f\"", "article_summary": "I\u2019ve heard some pretty fanciful spin on the \u201ckeep your plan\u201d promise, but that really does take the cake.\nFeinstein: Hey, you could have kept your plan \u2026 until we enacted ObamaCareposted at 8:01 am on November 4, 2013 by Ed MorrisseySen.
