That worked for a few years but eventually the formula resulted in pay decreases, angering doctors.\n\nCongress responded to each prospective cut in doctor fees by approving temporary adjustments to the formula.\n\nBut this time, Congress may approve a permanent \u201cdoc fix.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are happy to see that they are seeing the benefit of a permanent solution instead of kicking the can down the road, then picking it up and kicking it again,\u201d Katz said. He also said that if Congress does not stop the impending cuts in fees, some physicians in Connecticut may decide they can\u2019t afford to treat Medicare patients.\n\nWhile some specialists, like pediatricians, have few or no Medicare patients, about 25 percent to 30 percent of the patients treated by Connecticut doctors as a whole are on Medicare, Katz said.\n\nMeanwhile, Ariel A. Gonzalez, director of AARP's Health and Family Advocacy Team, says doctors\u2019 threats of dropping Medicare patients \u201chas been highly exaggerated.\u201d\n\nHe also said the AARP is very concerned about the way House Republicans propose to pay for some of the cost of the permanent doc fix, which is estimated at about $200 billion over 10 years.\n\nThe proposal, which has not been released in detail yet, would cover $35 billion of that cost by making two changes in the Medicare program.\n\n\u201cThat $35 billion would be paid for on the backs of Medicare beneficiaries,\u201d Gonzalez said.\n\nThe proposal would require those who purchase Medigap policies that supplement Medicare\u2019s basic coverage to pay a $250 deductible before receiving full coverage for a doctor visit.\n\nThe proposal would also hike, by 15 percent, the cost of premiums paid by high-income Medicare recipients.\n\nGonzalez said some of the highest-income Americans, who would have to pick up 80 percent of the cost of their premiums, would quit the Medicare system in favor of private insurance, \u201cleaving behind a lower-income, sicker population.\u201d\n\nThere are about 600,000 AARP members in Connecticut.\n\nThe proposal initially had bipartisan backing in the House.\n\nReps. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., and Sander Levin, D-Mich, the chairman and top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said on Friday, \"We are now engaging in active discussions on a bipartisan basis \u2014 following up on the work done by leadership \u2014 to try to achieve an effective permanent resolution to the SGR problem, strengthen Medicare for our seniors, and extend the popular Children's Health Insurance Program.\"\n\nBut concerns by AARP and other groups may undercut some of that support, especially on the Democratic side of the aisle.\n\nRep. John Larson, D-Conn., a member of the Ways and Means Committee, is reserving judgment for now.\n\n\u201cWhile discussions are ongoing, I continue to urge both sides of the aisle to work together towards developing a permanent solution to replace the flawed sustainable growth rate formula,\" he said.\n\nThe Senate has not yet weighed in on the House plan.\n\nChildren\u2019s health, too\n\nThe House package also includes a $5 billion two-year extension of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program past its current Sept. 30 expiration date. CHIP provides basic funding for the HUSKYB program that pays for the health care of children who live in moderate-income households.\n\nThe Connecticut Department of Social Services says about 13,530 children are served by the HUSKYB program.\n\nCHIP is a joint federal-state program, with Connecticut paying 45 percent of the cost of the program and the federal government paying 65 percent.\n\nBut the Affordable Care Act provided a boost to the funding the federal government would give the states. The package would authorize that boost, beginning on Oct 1, so that Connecticut\u2019s share would drop to 12 percent and the federal government\u2019s share would rise to 88 percent\n\n\u201cContinued funding for CHIP is essential,\u201d Gov. Dannel Malloy wrote congressional leaders last year.\n\n\u201cFailure to preserve CHIP funding will jeopardize continued coverage for children in demonstrated need for these supports and necessarily exposes states to significant budget constraints,\" the governor said.\n\nVoices for Children is among the child advocates who have been pressing Congress to extend the CHIP program.\n\nIt\u2019s good that Congress is not waiting for the last minute to do so, said Sharon Langer of Connecticut Voices for Children.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a budget session, so it would be really good for states to know how much they will get in CHIP funding,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/03/17/congress-doc-fix-set-to-halt-big-drop-in-medicare-fees/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Washington, AARP, CHIP, Congress, Connecticut State Medical Society, Dannel Malloy, doc fix, doctors, HuskyB", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/03/17/congress-doc-fix-set-to-halt-big-drop-in-medicare-fees/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The U.S. House of Representatives hopes to unveil a proposal this week that would end years of tension and bickering between Congress and the nation's doctors.
