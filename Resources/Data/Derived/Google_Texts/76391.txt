Dialing for depravity? There’s more than a glitch involved in the great national campaign to get Americans to sign up for Obamacare. The new toll-free consumer number associated with the Affordable Care Act uses an unfortunate sequence of numbers that unfortunately spells out 1-800-F***-YO.

The number was set up by the Department of Health and Human Services, which has offered no acknowledgement or comment so far.

First spotted by the sharp-eyed Washington Free Beacon writer Lachlan Markay, the revelation quickly circulated from one gleeful news organization to the next, including the Drudge Report, BuzzFeed, the Daily Caller, Hot Air and The Blaze.

“Obamacare hotline number sums up Obama’s message to the U.S.,” declared BizPac Review, a Florida-based news site.

It doesn’t much help to learn that some public outreach for Obamacare consumers includes the promise of a free smartphone.

The Nashville Business Journal reports that Community Health Alliance, the Obamacare health insurance co-op in Tennessee, is using the allure of an LG Lucid 2 4G smart phone, a phone plan and tech support, “included as a cost of their health plan benefits.”

The phone plan includes unlimited talk, unlimited texting and 1.2GB of data.
