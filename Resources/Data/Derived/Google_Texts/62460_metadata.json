That was the overwhelming vote in the House of Representatives last week to end the National Security Agency's bulk collection program. When little about our Congress is bipartisan, that vote showed remarkable unanimity among Republicans and Democrats that our intelligence agencies desperately need reining in, and soon.\n\nFrom massive data mining of American's personal information to the uncontrolled use of torture in secret prisons overseas to the rapid expansion of invasive drones, the time for oversight is now. But several controversial sections of the Patriot Act are about to expire and Congress is in a quagmire about what to do.\n\nLet me offer one suggestion. Don't make any long-term moves without serious analysis and examination. What is needed is an in-depth investigation of our intelligence agencies and Congress should take the lead with a special, select committee that includes key members involved in intelligence and homeland security issues. President Barack Obama should also issue an executive order to create a \"Simpson-Bowles\"-type commission on intelligence oversight for the 21st century. Both a Congressional investigation and presidential commission are long overdue.\n\n\n\n[SEE: Editorial Cartoons on Congress]\n\nBefore September 11, 2001, oversight was lacking; since then it has been \"how big a check can we write?\" According to the Washington Post, Snowden-leaked documents indicate that our 16 spy agencies employ over 107,000 people and now spend over $70 billion. That is twice the budget of 2001.\n\nDespite efforts to consolidate intelligence gathering and analysis after 9/11 there is still ample evidence that we are confronted with competing fiefdoms, lack of direction, confusing command and control and increased compartmentalization. This, combined with a rapidly growing complex technology that allows for easy collection, inexpensive storage and a vastly enhanced intrusive look at people's personal information demands a fresh, new look at civil liberties, national security and the laws that govern intelligence.\n\nThe 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that many of us worked on is woefully out of date, despite selective revisions. The passage of the Patriot Act that was done quickly after 9/11 needs to be seriously revisited. But right now, Congress is rushing to pass legislation without a serious and thorough look at what is needed and why it is needed. Right now, neither the Obama administration nor certain leaders in Congress want to rock the boat on intelligence.\n\nForty years ago this year the Church Committee was established to investigate domestic spying, assassination plots against foreign leaders and the lack of serious oversight of our intelligence agencies. Next week, two members of that committee, former Vice President Walter Mondale and former Sen. Gary Hart, will headline a day-long look at strengthening intelligence oversight, sponsored by the Brennan Center. Along with former staff members of the Church Committee and other experts, they will explore paths to reform.\n\n\n\n[READ: Rand Paul's Big Gift]", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "Congress Shouldn't Rush to Rewrite Expiring Patriot Act Provisions", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Lawmakers need to take a long hard look at U.S. intelligence agencies, not rush through a hasty Patriot Act rewrite.", "title": "Out of Date Intelligence", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/peter-fenn/2015/05/20/congress-shouldnt-rush-to-rewrite-expiring-patriot-act-provisions", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/fc/fad554c1ba3d84a9e5162fb3df2bab/media:7f65fefe75d64b87b9f0338279641640NSASurveillanceSecretLaw.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lawmakers need to take a long hard look at U.S. intelligence agencies, not rush through a hasty Patriot Act rewrite.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Congress Shouldn't Rush to Rewrite Expiring Patriot Act Provisions"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "May 20, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Peter Fenn,TJS,U.S. intelligence,NSA,Congress,picks,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion],Politics [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Lawmakers need to take a long hard look at U.S. intelligence agencies, not rush through a hasty Patriot Act rewrite."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc433\"", "article_summary": "President Barack Obama should also issue an executive order to create a \"Simpson-Bowles\"-type commission on intelligence oversight for the 21st century.\nBut several controversial sections of the Patriot Act are about to expire and Congress is in a quagmire about what to do.\nWhen little about our Congress is bipartisan, that vote showed remarkable unanimity among Republicans and Democrats that our intelligence agencies desperately need reining in, and soon.\nBut right now, Congress is rushing to pass legislation without a serious and thorough look at what is needed and why it is needed.\nThe 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that many of us worked on is woefully out of date, despite selective revisions."}
