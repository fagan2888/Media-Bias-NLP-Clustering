Just look at 2012. That was the year that any Republican not named Mitt Romney could have blown Barack Obama\u2019s re-election bid out of the water. And everyone knows what happened.\n\nExperts are predicting the GOP should pick up 10 seats in the House and not only have a majority in the Senate but actually have as much as a 10-vote majority.\n\nThere is a way the GOP could do even better than that. They could even pick up some races that are considered long shots right now, like the Virginia Senate race between Ed Gillespie and Obama favorite, Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat.\n\nFor years, Republican consultants, such as Karl Rove, have told Republican candidates to run content-free campaigns. They tell Republicans don\u2019t be controversial and whatever they do, don\u2019t run on conservative issues.\n\nThat ignores the fact that the only time the Republicans have won big in the last generation, 1980, 1994 and 2012, Republican candidates ran on being conservative.\n\nThere is one issue that works this cycle.\n\nThis is an issue that reaches all voters and that the Democrats are incredibly vulnerable on.\n\nIt is Ebola.\n\nThe prospect of an Ebola pandemic scares the hell out of a lot of Americans. The Obama regime has done everything possible to bring Ebola to this nation. From bringing victims to America, when they could have been treated in other places, to not stopping direct flights from Ebola nations to America. The regime will not cancel visas being held by people in Ebola hot zone nations.\n\nDemocrats will politicize any issue, so no issue should be off limits to Republicans and Ebola is an issue that affects every American.\n\nIn Virginia, Mr. Gillespie, who is closing in the polls, should mention Ebola, incumbent Warner and Barack Obama in every speech he makes. He should run non-stop commercials tying Mr. Warner to the Obama regime and Ebola.\n\nLast year, when Ken Cuccinelli, the gubernatorial candidate in Virginia, quit running a content-free campaign and started hitting Terry McAuliffe on Obamacare, his numbers rose dramatically. By running on a powerful issue, Mr. Cuccinelli closed the gap without the benefit of TV advertising.\n\nIn Colorado, Cory Gardner has a slight lead over incumbent Democrat Mark Udall. This is despite the millions Tom Steyer and other far-left-wing billionaires are spending to help Mr. Udall keep his seat. Mr. Udall is depending on the millions from the radical billionaires who support expensive wind energy to keep him in office.\n\nEbola changes that.\n\nNo one cares about how much electricity costs if you aren\u2019t alive to pay the bill.\n\nMr. Gardner should tie Mr. Udall to Obama and Ebola in every speech he makes and every commercial he runs.\n\nEbola is a real threat to America. The policies of the Obama regime have made it possible for Ebola to come to America and are now setting the stage for the very real possibility that Americans will die from Ebola.\n\nAll is fair in love, war and politics. The Democrats created this problem.\n\nIt is time the Republicans made them own it.\n\nAnd when they do, they win.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There is an issue that reaches all voters and that the Democrats are incredibly vulnerable on.
