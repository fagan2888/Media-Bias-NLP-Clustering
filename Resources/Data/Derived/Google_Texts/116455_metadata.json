But it hasn\u2019t done nearly as good a job as actually hooking up the patients with doctors.\n\nOn Thursday, a legislative committee voted to conduct an audit to find out why.\n\nThe heavy influx of new patients, coupled with computer problems, caused a quick backlog of 900,000 Medi-Cal applicants earlier in the year that has reportedly been reduced to 400,000. But having insurance coverage is not the same as having access to medical care, as Medi-Cal and Covered California (CC) patients are finding out.\n\nState Senator Richard Lara (D-Bell Gardens), whose committee asked California State Auditor Elaine Howle to review the situation, said, \u201cJust because we want to give millions of people medical insurance and cards doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re going to be able to receive services.\u201d\n\nHowle will focus on three counties, but the California Health Report said it was uncertain if she would select the same three counties\u2014Fresno, Butte and Imperial\u2014that it used for a damning story in June. The report found that half the primary-care doctors on lists given to low-income patients by insurance companies weren\u2019t taking new patients or couldn\u2019t be reached by phone for one reason or another.\n\nSome listed doctors have died, some have moved and some have retired. But the problem extends far beyond bad communication between doctors and insurance companies. The state doesn\u2019t pay doctors a whole lot to handle Medi-Cal patients and as a result many have reduced how many patients they see.\n\nThe California HealthCare Foundation recently highlighted the problem when it presented a report from the University of California, San Francisco, which found that there were 35-49 physicians for everyone 100,000 Medi-Cal patients. That is far short of the federal standard of 68-102. The study was conducted from 2011-2013, before Obamacare increased the rolls.\n\nDoctors in public clinics and community health centers had the highest participation (92%) while physicians in solo practices were at 54%. Only 62% said they accepted new Medi-Cal patients.\n\nMore than 7 million Californians, one in every five residents, are enrolled in a Medi-Cal managed care plan. But that\u2019s just three-fourths of all Medi-Cal patients. The rest see doctors who receive about the lowest rate of reimbursement in the country, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe state reduced reimbursement rates 10% for Medi-Cal doctors during the budget crisis but lawsuits held up the cuts until last September\u2015after the budget was back in balance.\n\nThe Medi-Cal problem is not unlike that faced by Covered California, where there are literally no lists of participating doctors. Insurance companies like Blue Shield of California and Blue Cross say the network of doctors participating in Covered California is somewhere around 60% of their regular networks, but since there are no lists that\u2019s a hard number to verify.\n\nWhen Covered California rolled out last year, the website briefly posted what was purported to be legitimate network lists. They weren\u2019t. They had dead, retired and absent doctors listed and were quickly pulled. More importantly, the doctors and the insurance companies don\u2019t agree on who should be in the CC network.\n\nIt is being represented as a contractual disagreement, but probably won\u2019t be solved before this November\u2019s open enrollment, if ever.\n\nNot surprisingly, complaints about Medi-Cal are way up this year. Monthly complaints to the Department of Health Care Services\u2019 Managed Care Ombudsman Office about the program have increased 82% since 2013, according to the California Health Report.\n\n\u2013Ken Broder\n\nTo Learn More:\n\nLegislative Committee Orders Audit of Medi-Cal Directories after Reports of Inaccuracies (by Hannah Guzik, California Health Report)\n\nMedi-Cal Struggles to Provide Services to Ever-Growing Clientele (by Chris Megerian, Los Angeles Times)\n\nHuge Increase in Cases Handled by Medi-Cal Complaint Office This Year (by Hannah Guzik, California Health Report)\n\nPhysician Participation in Medi-Cal: Ready for the Enrollment Boom?
