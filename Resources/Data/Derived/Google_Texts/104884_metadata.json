Transportation is one of the many expenses associated with emergency care. - Lewis Wallace\n\nOne of the arguments in favor of the Affordable Care Act was that it would reduce dependency on emergency rooms by covering more people with basic preventive care. Now, millions of people are newly covered by Obamacare. So are emergency departments seeing a slowdown?\n\nNot so much.\n\nOn the street in downtown Dayton, Ohio, Rebekah Jacobsen says before the Affordable Care Act, she racked up thousands in medical bills.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have health care. I didn\u2019t have anything,\u201d she says. Now, she\u2019s on Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income people. Ohio\u2019s one of the 27 states that expanded their program with federal funds available under the new law. But Jacobsen was in the emergency room just last month\u2014admittedly not for the most serious problem.\n\n\u201cI thought I had lice, and I didn\u2019t,\u201d she says. Her head was itching, and it turned out to be dandruff.\n\nAn ER visit for dandruff is just the kind of situation some people will point to as burdening the whole system. Jacobsen says she would have gone to a regular doctor to see if she had lice, but it was the middle of the night. With her new insurance, the ER trip didn\u2019t cost her anything.\n\nUp the road at Miami Valley Hospital, Dr. Darin Pangalangan, an emergency doctor and head of the Emergency and Trauma Institute for Premier Health, says he thinks people should be able to use the ER when they need to - or even just think they need to.\n\n\u201cYou cannot go to your family doctor at midnight. They\u2019re not open at midnight,\u201d he says. He says it\u2019s not an abuse of the system to access an ER if you think you may have a problem, and you can\u2019t get in to see a regular doctor. What\u2019s more, emergency doctors are bound by law to help anyone who comes in the door\u2014 regardless of their ability to pay \u2014to at least investigate to see if they have a serious problem. Most people who walk through the doors come in with problems that need immediate attention.\n\nThe still-looming Obamacare question though, is this: Will people actually depend on ERs less for basic care once they\u2019re insured, driving costs down for everyone? Or will more people, like Rebekah Jacobsen, go to the ER because, well, now they can?\n\n\u201cThe cost of going to the emergency department might be a major deterrent for the uninsured,\u201d says Katherine Baicker, a Harvard health economist who worked on a study of new Medicaid recipients in Oregon. She found that people who got on Medicaid then went to the ER more. \u201cOnce they have access to insurance, they can go to the emergency department without being concerned about being presented with an enormous bill at the end.\u201d\n\nHoward Mell, a spokesman for the American College of Emergency Physicians, says many of his members are seeing increased traffic, though ER visits were already on the rise.\n\n\u201cMost emergency departments have actually seen an increase in the amount of people coming through the door,\u201d Mell says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a huge increase, but it\u2019s certainly noticeable.\u201d\n\nBut the experts don\u2019t all agree: another study in Massachusetts found expanding to near-universal health coverage led to fewer people using emergency rooms in cases when it wasn\u2019t really an emergency. And still another study looking at Medicaid recipients in Ohio found that expanded Medicaid coverage could help reduce ER visits and increase the use of primary care. Doctors at MetroHealth, the county hospital at the center of that study, say integrating patients into a \u201cpatient-centered medical home\u201d model of care helps keep people focused on primary and preventive care, and makes them less likely to show up at an ER when they don't need to.\n\nOverall, the jury is still out\u2014some 13 million people are just now settling into having health insurance, either through Medicaid or the ACA exchanges. It\u2019s not clear yet how all those people might use the ER differently, and what strategies providers might use to cut costs to the overall system. Regardless, one recent study found emergency rooms in the United States are generally profitable, and predicted a rise in revenues and profit margins for ERs as more people get covered.\n\nStill, emergency care is an expensive way to get help to people who don\u2019t have immediate, severe conditions, which is why health networks like Premier in Dayton are trying to offer alternatives. Kathryn Lorenz is a doctor at what\u2019s called an \"after hours clinic\" in Troy, Ohio\u2014they\u2019re open from 5 to 9 p.m. weekdays, and offer weekend hours.\n\n\u201cYou can walk in up to the last minute and we would see you,\u201d says Lorenz. The clinic helps folks who can\u2019t get a quick appointment with a family doctor for something acute like back pain, poison ivy or lice. It\u2019s a less costly option than an ER, but Lorenz also says there are things she can\u2019t do for patients here. \u201cA lot of times I\u2019m wrestling them to go to the ER, and telling them, 'yes, you must pay your co-pay and get in there because you have a life-threatening illness.'\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not like most people are in a huge rush to go to an emergency room. Take Dayton resident Roberta Gilliam. She says she recently got Medicaid, and she\u2019s been taking advantage of it by getting preventive care, not by going to the ER.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had my pap smear, I\u2019ve had my mammograms, I\u2019ve had my dentures, my X-rays, I\u2019m getting ready to get a partial,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been a blessing.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the safety net she\u2019s grateful for.\n\n\u201cWhen anybody can get insurance, you know they\u2019re happy to have insurance,\u201d she says. \u201cEspecially the ones that can\u2019t afford insurance.\u201d\n\nEmergency care is really just one small piece of the puzzle: more people getting coverage is likely to mean more use of all kinds of health services. The basic economic principle is, when something becomes cheaper for people, they use more of it.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "application-name": "Marketplace from APM", "og": {"url": "http://www.marketplace.org/2014/07/29/health-care/ers-are-still-busy-affordable-care-act-and-all", "image": "http://cms.marketplace.org/system/files/styles/primary-image-900x500/private/copter.jpg?itok=5deA2k5G", "type": "article", "description": "But it's not clear how much is left to change.", "title": "ERs are still busy, Affordable Care Act and all"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Marketplace"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/assets/mstile-70x70-797ef1ac7d8ffe040b98bab7140abf109b307280019c7d5c16c614ac6f66319d.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/assets/mstile-310x310-9380546aaae2d32ed4a1460d4ffac0ddd0197d240c08a97d9ba80e663f2f42e2.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/assets/mstile-310x150-11f7c8519056bc96bf2540c4b2aa8564178ebcae2594d3e8fb28d480f2c5cd8a.png", "csrf-token": "pN0D73lCYCeSX/fNL7/OG+71hS+34ep5WRzmk7NnFc2Sfa1Umk6Zlp+y3R4VICm32RDPMU1cjeej0K+Z5bXkPQ==", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/mstile-144x144-a9640051fbfb73c1de9771231343135b5f79295e3f98bb1cb87854aa6a74f8c8.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/assets/mstile-150x150-1d103d04b61aaa10bb165f225c46e694338b92918bc7a7ca2b99b54bdd1bbc0c.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "On the street in downtown Dayton, Ohio, Rebekah Jacobsen says before the Affordable Care Act, she racked up thousands in medical bills.\nTransportation is one of the many expenses associated with emergency care.\n- Lewis WallaceOne of the arguments in favor of the Affordable Care Act was that it would reduce dependency on emergency rooms by covering more people with basic preventive care.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have health care.\nNow, she\u2019s on Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income people."}
