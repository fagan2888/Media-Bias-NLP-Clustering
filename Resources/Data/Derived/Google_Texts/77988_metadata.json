One year ago, the floods that swept through the state submerged the park and surrounding community.\n\nOn Saturday, a small portion of the beloved park was reopened as the community came together to reflect on the disaster and celebrate the recovery the community has made since it was severely damaged last September.\n\nSpeer was manning the event\u2019s popcorn machine as she recalled the day the flood came. Her home, barn and stables sat near the South Platte River. She watched as the river rose and raged.\n\n\u201cIt was shocking. It became a 5- foot wall of water,\u201d she said. \u201cIt looked like a tsunami.\u201d\n\nShe rushed to evacuate her horses, which fled to their stable. Once she entered the building, she waded through chest-deep water to get them out.\n\nThe water just missed her home and barn, but she knew others in her neighborhood were not as lucky. She soon joined the Evans Flood Recovery and Redevelopment Taskforce to help the city and residents recover.\n\n\u201cThe flood brought the community together. A year later, this day symbolizes the resilience of the community,\u201d Speer said.\n\nSen. Michael Bennet and Gov. John Hickenlooper, both Democrats, stopped by Riverside Park on Saturday to attend one of several events scheduled in communities affected by last year\u2019s floods.\n\nBennet chatted with some families and cast a line into the park\u2019s fishing area.\n\nHe said although there are big recovery projects still to be done, the celebration at Evans is a great testament to a community coming together in adversity and rising above it. \u201cWe\u2019re going to move heaven and Earth to accomplish the rest of what needs to be done.\u201d\n\nEvans has spent $1.2 million on flood recovery, according to City Manager Aden Hogan, and is in the process of waiting to be reimbursed by FEMA.\n\nHogan said costs would run between $12 million and $18 million.\n\n\u201cIt was a total loss, but our city and community are coming together to make it better,\u201d he said.\n\nAs Hickenlooper surveyed the park grounds, he said he felt pride for the whole state\u2019s resilience.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep raising money and reaching out to communities that need recovery,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\nMayor John Morris said it will take a long time before Evans is completely healed. More than 200 mobile homes were destroyed, he said, along with 56 homes that suffered severe damage.\n\n\u201cSeeing the devastation was unbelievable. Seeing the progress and the park come back like this just warms my heart,\u201d Morris said.\n\nHe pointed to a group of kids playing tag and said seeing the activity and enjoyment the reopened space was getting was incredible.\n\n\u201cThis park was our pride and joy. Seeing a part of it reopen is seeing the road to recovery,\u201d Morris said.\n\nWarren Jones, Evans flood recovery manager, said there are several ongoing projects consisting of redesigning the park, helping the affected Riverside neighborhood and constructing a new wastewater treatment plant.\n\n\u201cWe want to take our time with all of this and do it right because we don\u2019t want to build back a park that will be as vulnerable to floods,\u201d Jones said.\n\nThere was no projection as to when more of Riverside Park would be open to the public, Jones said.\n\nAlthough only a small section of the 101-acre park was open, residents headed out with their fishing poles, dogs and families.\n\nKenna Linden, 7, held up a worm and wrinkled her nose as she baited her fishing pole.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to fish some more here,\u201d she said.\n\nLater in the day, Udall and Hickenlooper also visited Lyons\u2019 Bohn Park. \u201cColorado is not defined by disasters, but by the way it rebuilds,\u201d Udall said.\n\nMike Matzuk, a Jamestown resident, said the Lyons celebration helps return life to normal.\n\n\u201cAnybody who has been through this year needs to feel the high spirits and energy of our community,\u201d he said.\n\nElizabeth Hernandez: 303-954-1223, ehernandez@denverpost.com or twitter.com/literally_lizzy", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Evans celebrates post-flood rebirth at Riverside Park Saturday", "title": "Evans celebrates post-flood rebirth at Riverside Park Saturday", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/13/evans-celebrates-post-flood-rebirth-at-riverside-park-saturday/", "image": {"width": 458, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140913__evans-riverside-parkp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140913__evans-riverside-parkp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-13T15:48:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:14:19+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "She soon joined the Evans Flood Recovery and Redevelopment Taskforce to help the city and residents recover.\nEVANS \u2014 As Laura Speer looked around Riverside Park, it was hard to hold back the tears.\nJohn Hickenlooper, both Democrats, stopped by Riverside Park on Saturday to attend one of several events scheduled in communities affected by last year\u2019s floods.\nThere was no projection as to when more of Riverside Park would be open to the public, Jones said.\nWarren Jones, Evans flood recovery manager, said there are several ongoing projects consisting of redesigning the park, helping the affected Riverside neighborhood and constructing a new wastewater treatment plant."}
