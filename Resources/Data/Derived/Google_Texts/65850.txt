When it comes to figuring out how he feels about Arizona’s anti-gay Jim Crow bill, Glenn Beck is really struggling.

During Tuesday’s “morning meeting,” Beck sat around with some of his co-workers and explained at length his thinking on the controversial bill:

Emotionally, I’m torn on it, because I want people to — let’s treat people right, let’s just be good, decent people. And [I] thought today, I don’t to see signs in my country that say No Jews, No Dogs, No Gays — whatever. And you’d have the right to have a sign if your religion taught you that. And there are religions that would say No Jews, No Dogs and No Gays. So I don’t like that. But I thought, you know what? We’re not the same America that we were in the 1950s. We won’t frequent those places. And so there’s half of it. The other half is, I don’t want to be forced to do something that goes against my religion. So why is this law so wrong, so hateful?

Later on, speaking about a hypothetical business owner who decides they won’t let LGBT people shop in their store, Beck said, “Is it their right to do that? Yeah! Fine.”

Beck next compared anti-gay discrimination (or really any form of discrimination) to a nightclub bouncer or owner deciding who will be admitted and who won’t. “What are they doing? They’re discriminating against people like me — old, dumpy people.”

Beck wasn’t done there, though. He went on to argue that dermatologists should be allowed to refuse to examine people based on their sexuality, religion, ethnicity or race — but that emergency room doctors should not be granted the same privilege. “Emergency, life-saving care? No, you’ve got to take the person and stop the bleeding.”
