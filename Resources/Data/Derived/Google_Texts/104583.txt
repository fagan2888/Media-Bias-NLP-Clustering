It’s hardly a coincidence that hard drives would fail.

The hearings on the Internal Revenue Scandal are a demonstration of hypocrisy from Democrats who are feigning outrage over what they say is a partisan witch hunt.

Who would know better what a partisan witch hunt was but Democrats who still blame George W. Bush for the Hurricane Katrina debacle in New Orleans and for hating black people?

Locally, one might point to the Wisconsin press and Democrats printing released documents in the John Doe investigation that has been halted by two judges.

Statistics would tell us that it’s virtually impossible that hard drives for those involved in the scandal of targeting conservative organizations seeking 501(c)(4) status would all fail in the same time frame and that Sonasoft, an email-archiving company was fired just at the time that Lois Lerner’s hard drive failed. In addition, the IRS claims backups didn’t exist. Coincidence? I don’t think so.

During his questioning during a House hearing, John Koskinen, the IRS executive, displayed incredible hubris in his testimony that someone should question his truthfulness. Koskinen had donated close to $100,000 to Democratic candidates since the late ’70s, including $5,000 to President Barack Obama in 2012. That destroys any claim of impartiality. I would think that Lerner’s taking her 5th Amendment rights would be one such clue that a crime was committed.

The present administration is the most lawless or incompetent administration the country has ever seen, based on the endless string of failures and scandals, every one of which was news to the president.
