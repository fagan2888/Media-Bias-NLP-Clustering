What is going on now is a message that the excessive optimism that has been spreading around is wrong,\u201d Nobel Prize-winning U.S. economist Joseph Stiglitz told Reuters.\n\nWhile Moscovici said he was confident that the world's central banks have the ammunition to revive the global economy after years of record low interest rates and quantitative easing, Stiglitz was not convinced.\n\n\u201cThe Fed (U.S. Federal Reserve) doesn't get it. The Fed raises interest rates, Brazil raises interest rates in a world in which things are not good. Central banks are often more out of tune with reality than markets,\u201d Stiglitz said, adding he saw no chance of any intervention at a G7 or G20 level.\n\nVeteran British businessman Roger Carr, who is chairman of British defense group BAE Systems, said the future was not looking bright.\n\n\"This time last year in Davos there was a very different environment, it was quite benign. The issue was the haves and the have nots, it wasn't: 'are we all going to have less?'.\"\n\n\"It is very pessimistic at the moment,\" he told Reuters.\n\nHEALTHY CORRECTION\n\nHowever, bankers such as former Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond said the slowdown in Chinese growth was a \"healthy correction\" which, while serious, was needed.\n\nRelated: Are These the Death Throes of the Seven-Year Bull Market?\n\nDiamond, who now invests in Africa, told reporters that the situation now was not comparable to the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first of 2009 which he described as \"the deepest economic correction I have ever seen\" as the U.S economy was growing and western Europe was doing well.\n\nThis was echoed by Professor Ding Yuan, vice-president and dean of the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, who told Reuters it would be wrong to take the small devaluation of the Chinese yuan and the falls in the Shanghai 300 index as indicators of China's economic health.\n\n\u201cThis is only short-term volatility... People are focusing on the short term too much. We should be looking at the next five years, not the next two months,\u201d he said.\n\nFor CEOs at Davos trying to navigate the year ahead, the price of oil remains the great unknown.\n\n\"In many of the markets we operate in, the oil price is clearly a major factor of the health of the economy. We're expecting governments to adapt to this new current order of oil prices, whether they're at $30 or lower or higher. Who knows what's going to happen in 2016?\" Vimpelcom CEO Jean-Yves Charlier told Reuters in an interview.\n\nReporting by Paul Taylor, Martinne Geller, Elizabeth Piper; Sujata Rao, Carmel Crimmins, Dmitry Zhdannikov and Noah Barkin; Writing by Alexander Smith; Editing by Anna Willard.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Blood-letting in global markets is dominating corridor talk as business leaders and po", "title": "Market Turmoil Rattles the Halls of Davos", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/20/Market-Turmoil-Rattles-Halls-Davos", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02202016_Davos_World_Economic_Forum.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/20/Market-Turmoil-Rattles-Halls-Davos", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02202016_Davos_World_Economic_Forum.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Blood-letting in global markets is dominating corridor talk as business leaders and po", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "If sustained, the 9.9 percent fall in the index in January would be the worst monthly loss since 2009, towards the end of the global financial crisis.\nCentral banks are often more out of tune with reality than markets,\u201d Stiglitz said, adding he saw no chance of any intervention at a G7 or G20 level.\nBlood-letting in global markets is dominating corridor talk as business leaders and policymakers meet in Davos, although so far the view is that it doesn't signal a financial crisis.\nHARBINGER OF PROBLEMSHowever, some in Davos were less confident about the outlook for 2016 after the rocky start to the year.\nWhat is going on now is a message that the excessive optimism that has been spreading around is wrong,\u201d Nobel Prize-winning U.S. economist Joseph Stiglitz told Reuters."}
