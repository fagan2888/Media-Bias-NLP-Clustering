The President penned an essay for the New York Times which went online shortly before the start of his CNN town hall on gun issues. For the most part, Obama regurgitated the same arguments he\u2019s made all along, but almost buried in the middle of the column was a new threat, this one aimed at Democrats who won\u2019t play ball with him in Congress:\n\nEven as I continue to take every action possible as president, I will also take every action I can as a citizen. I will not campaign for, vote for or support any candidate, even in my own party, who does not support common-sense gun reform. And if the 90 percent of Americans who do support common-sense gun reforms join me, we will elect the leadership we deserve.\n\nWhere to start with this threat? First, the numbers behind it are laughable. The \u201c90%\u201d claim comes from this Gallup poll showing 86% of people favor universal background checks for all gun purchases.\u201d That\u2019s what we already have, except for personal transactions, usually between family members. Online and gun-show sales from retailers still require a background check through a federally licensed firearms dealer (FFL), and the change Obama announced only made an ambiguity between retailers and hobbyists even more ambiguous. In poll after poll, though, Americans don\u2019t consider gun control a primary or even secondary public issue, and recently two media polling series have shown majority opposition to so-called \u201cassault weapons\u201d bans for the first time.\n\nThe disconnect between Obama\u2019s \u201c90%\u201d rhetoric and reality can be seen in the makeup of Congress. Obama started pushing hard on gun control in 2013, at the start of his second term. If \u201c90% of Americans\u201d wanted gun control expanded, why did Democrats suffer such a sharp loss in the next midterm election?\n\nThat\u2019s why this threat to Democrats on gun control is silly, and evidence of a lack of contact with reality. Democrats in safe seats can afford to talk about gun control and don\u2019t really need Obama to campaign for them, although they wouldn\u2019t mind his fundraising and organization. Democrats in swing states and districts won\u2019t want to remind voters that their party has decided again to go all in on gun control, and won\u2019t want Obama within 50 miles of their campaign anyway. In fact, his efforts make using Obama\u2019s personal qualities even more risky on the campaign trail for these Democrats in purple areas, and that includes the next Democratic nominee.\n\nSpeaking of separations from reality, Obama took a moment during his town hall last night to dismiss the concerns of a rape survivor who wants to provide for her own self-defense. Obama followed up by suggesting she might be too careless to manage firearm ownership:\n\nHe pointed out that, though he didn\u2019t think Corban\u2019s guns necessarily made her safer, he\u2019s not trying to take them away. \u201cI just want to repeat that there\u2019s nothing that we\u2019ve proposed that would make it harder for you to purchase a firearm.\u201d And: \u201cYou have to be pretty well trained in order to fire a weapon against somebody who is assaulting you and catches you by surprise.\u201d And: \u201cThere\u2019s always the possibility that that firearm in a home leads to a tragic accident.\u201d And: \u201cAll I\u2019m focused on is making sure that a terrible crime like yours that was committed is not made easier because somebody can go on the Internet and just buy whatever weapon they want without us finding out whether they\u2019re a criminal or not.\u201d Corban wasn\u2019t impressed. \u201cI would say it was more of a non-response,\u201d she told The Post. \u201cHe kind of dodged the question.\u201d \u2026 Saying Obama was working without a script or a teleprompter, Corban criticized the president\u2019s insistence on talking about how guns endanger children every time he \u201cgot jammed\u201d at the town hall. Doesn\u2019t he understand that she has guns because she wants to keep her children safe in her family\u2019s home? \u201cThat\u2019s where I understand this violence happens,\u201d she said, mentioning that her daughter will be a year old soon. \u201cIt\u2019s not just on the news. It\u2019s not just in far-off places. My nightmares are real. They are my memories. I don\u2019t want that for my own kid.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s utter condescension was not limited to his New York Times virtue-signaling op-ed, in other words.\n\nUpdate: I forgot to link to the Washington Post on the Corban story, which I fixed above, and corrected a grammatical error as well.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Plus, dismissing self-defense argument from \u2026 a rape survivor?", "title": "Obama to Dems: Back my gun-control play or I won\u2019t campaign for you", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2016/01/08/obama-to-dems-back-my-gun-control-play-or-i-wont-campaign-for-you/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/mqnxvwOnPBU/0.jpg", "identifier": "http://img.youtube.com/vi/mqnxvwOnPBU/0.jpg"}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@EdMorrissey"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-08T17:01:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-08T18:58:04+00:00"}, "keywords": "2016 election, Barack Obama, CNN, Democrats, gun control, rape, town hall,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Obama to Dems: Back my gun-control play or I won\u2019t campaign for youposted at 12:01 pm on January 8, 2016 by Ed MorrisseyIt turns out that Barack Obama wants to play hardball on gun control with everyone.\nObama started pushing hard on gun control in 2013, at the start of his second term.\nThat\u2019s why this threat to Democrats on gun control is silly, and evidence of a lack of contact with reality.\nIf \u201c90% of Americans\u201d wanted gun control expanded, why did Democrats suffer such a sharp loss in the next midterm election?\nDemocrats in swing states and districts won\u2019t want to remind voters that their party has decided again to go all in on gun control, and won\u2019t want Obama within 50 miles of their campaign anyway."}
