It\u2019s the president\u2019s dereliction of duty. It\u2019s not that he is trying his best and getting it wrong. It\u2019s the suspicion, the near-certainty, that he\u2019s flubbing everything because he just doesn\u2019t care. Or worse, it\u2019s the suspicion that American failure\u2014particularly American failure overseas\u2014neatly fits with his ideological prejudices.\n\nYet talk of impeachment is premature and misplaced. The fact is that Obama\u2019s worst failures have been in the areas\u2014foreign policy and diplomacy\u2014where the president has the most unilateral authority, where he is supposed to be able to act without really having to answer to Congress.\n\nWhich is to say that the proper constitutional remedy is for the American people to not vote for the SOB. But they did vote for him, so unfortunately the public is just going to have to suffer the consequences.\n\nIt\u2019s not like they didn\u2019t have lots of evidence already about his outlook and intentions. And it\u2019s not like they weren\u2019t warned about everything that could go wrong, from Iraq to Russia. I never thought I would find myself pining for the lost Mitt Romney presidency, but I have to admit that on a whole slew of issues, Romney was right.\n\nThe American people heard these arguments, and they went with the other guy. So we have to remember H.L. Mencken\u2019s dictum: the people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard. They voted for Obama, they got him, and now they have to lump it. If they don\u2019t like the results, they can choose better next time.\n\nThat\u2019s the crux of the issue. Instead of wasting our efforts on impeachment, we should be focused on helping the American people learn from their mistakes. They need to learn about the perils of believing in a great leader who will solve all their problems. They need to learn about the stupidity of voting for a candidate in order to symbolically repudiate the legacy of racism (or, in 2016, sexism), rather than voting for an actual leader. And they need to learn the specific lessons about Obama\u2019s peculiar combination of domestic statism and blame-America-first foreign policy, an ideology in which our government can do no wrong at home and do no right overseas.\n\nThere is only one issue I can see right now that might conceivably justify impeachment: the IRS scandal. It\u2019s pretty clear by now that a cabal of political appointees at the IRS was deliberately harassing political organizations opposed to their agenda. It\u2019s also becoming clear that they conspired to cover it up after the fact. What would make this a presidential scandal is if investigators find evidence that this was coordinated from the White House and that the president was involved, either directly ordering the abuses or (as with Nixon) protecting the people who did. That would indeed count as \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d So we need to keep asking: what did the president know and when did he know it?\n\nBy all means let\u2019s keep following the trail of the IRS investigation and see how far it leads us. But until it ensnares the president, it is not grounds for impeachment.\n\nThe impeachment of Bill Clinton was one of the first big events in my career as a writer, and it is seared into my brain. We need to learn why it was such a disaster for Republicans. Clinton\u2019s infraction, lying under oath, was uncontestably real (unless you\u2019re genuinely confused about what the meaning of the word \u201cis\u201d is). But the topic he was lying about was not of sufficient stature to warrant impeachment. And it turned out that the American people were no more enthusiastic than I was to hear all the details of Bill Clinton\u2019s sex life.\n\nThe problem in 1998 was that the Republican Party was trying to use the Lewinsky scandal to do what they weren\u2019t able to accomplish at the polls: ensure the political defeat of a hated adversary. But they were trying to do it through means that were not intended by our political system.\n\nLook at it from the widest perspective. Central planning isn\u2019t part of our economic system, and it\u2019s not part of our political system, either. If we end up with a bad leader\u2014one who is incompetent or malevolent\u2014there is only so much that can be done centrally by politicians in Washington, DC, to fix it. Most of our problems have to be fixed by the people themselves. That\u2019s the way the system works, and that\u2019s the way it ought to work.\n\nThat may not be very comforting in the short term. If the first year and a half of President Obama\u2019s second term is anything to go by, we\u2019re in for a rough couple of years. Perhaps these periods of national crisis and decline are necessary, every once in a while, to remind voters of the consequences of making bad decisions. The last 444 days of Jimmy Carter\u2019s presidency come to mind. But we can only salvage something good from this adversity if we focus on explaining exactly what has gone wrong and why. There is no short cut around that process.\n\nIf none of this convinces you, then consider one final fact: if Barack Obama is impeached, then Joe Biden would become president.
