When you take 50 shots in a game, you know the night is yours. Kobe also scored 60 points Wednesday night against the Jazz, which only adds to the more than 33,000 career points.

Throughout the night the 5-time NBA champion received multiple standing ovations. The night also included video tributes and plenty of well wishes from his famous friends.

The 18-time All-Star turned pro at just 17, spending his entire career with the Lakers.

"To spend 20 years here, you can't write something better than this. Itâ€™s beautiful. I can't believe it's come to an end. You'll always be in my heart," Kobe said.
