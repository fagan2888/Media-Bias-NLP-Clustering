Inflation has been so low this year that economists say there is little chance the September numbers will produce a benefit increase for next year.\n\nPrices actually have dropped from a year ago, according to the inflation measure used for the COLA.\n\n\"It's a very high probability that it will be zero,\" said economist Polina Vlasenko, a research fellow at the American Institute for Economic Research. \"Other prices - other than energy - would have to jump. It would have to be a very sizable increase that would be visible, and I don't think that's happened.\"\n\nCongress enacted automatic increases for Social Security beneficiaries in 1975, when inflation was high and there was a lot of pressure to regularly raise benefits. Since then, increases have averaged 4 percent a year.\n\nOnly twice before, in 2010 and 2011, have there been no increases.\n\nIn all, the COLA affects payments to more than 70 million Americans.\n\nAlmost 60 million retirees, disabled workers, spouses and children get Social Security benefits. The average monthly payment is $1,224.\n\nThe COLA also affects benefits for about 4 million disabled veterans, 2.5 million federal retirees and their survivors, and more than 8 million people who get Supplemental Security Income, the disability program for the poor. Many people who get SSI also receive Social Security.\n\nCarol Mead of Montrose, Pennsylvania, said she and her husband were counting on Social Security COLA to help them with their finances.\n\n\"My husband is working just so we can pay our bills,\" said Mead, a retired land-use administrator. \"He's 70 years old, and he's still working in a stone quarry. He's told me a number of times that he thinks he's going to have to work until the day he dies.\"\n\nMore bad news: The lack of a COLA means that older people could face higher health care costs.\n\nMost have their Medicare Part B premiums for outpatient care deducted directly from their Social Security payments, and the annual cost-of-living increase is usually enough to cover any rise in premiums. When that doesn't happen, a long-standing federal \"hold harmless\" law protects the majority of beneficiaries from having their Social Security payments reduced.\n\nBut that leaves about 30 percent of Medicare beneficiaries on the hook for a premium increase that otherwise would be spread among all. Those who would pay the higher premiums include 2.8 million new beneficiaries, 1.6 million whose premiums aren't deducted from their Social Security payments and 3.1 million people with higher incomes.\n\nTheir premiums could jump by about $54 a month; more for those with higher incomes.\n\nStates also would feel a budget impact because they pay part of the Medicare premium for about 10 million low-income beneficiaries.\n\nAll beneficiaries would see their Part B annual deductible for outpatient care jump by $76, to an estimated $223. The deductible is the annual amount patients pay before Medicare kicks in.\n\n\"This would affect all beneficiaries,\" said Tricia Neuman of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. \"This kind of an increase is unprecedented.\"\n\nSenate Democrats have introduced legislation that would freeze Medicare's Part B premium and deductible for 2016, but its prospects are uncertain.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Katie Hill said, \"We share the goal of keeping Medicare's premiums affordable, are exploring all options.\"", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "For just the third time in 40 years, millions of Social Security recipients, disabled veterans and federal retirees can expect no increase in benefits next year.", "author": "CBS News", "og": {"url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/30234336/no-increase-in-social-security-benefits-expected", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/8992434_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "For just the third time in 40 years, millions of Social Security recipients, disabled veterans and federal retirees can expect no increase in benefits next year.", "title": "No Increase In Social Security Benefits Expected"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/8992434_G.jpg", "description": "For just the third time in 40 years, millions of Social Security recipients, disabled veterans and federal retirees can expect no increase in benefits next year.", "card": "summary", "title": "No Increase In Social Security Benefits Expected"}, "wnreadableurl": "no-increase-in-social-security-benefits-expected", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KOTV", "fb": {"app_id": 497059410331845}, "date": "2015/10/11", "KEYWORDS": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS03", "verify-v1": "67+ifqPKEX7ZTB2sopjxTD1c6nx6ScxupNN92EqnIpc=", "news_keywords": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe13df\"", "article_summary": "Congress enacted automatic increases for Social Security beneficiaries in 1975, when inflation was high and there was a lot of pressure to regularly raise benefits.\nCarol Mead of Montrose, Pennsylvania, said she and her husband were counting on Social Security COLA to help them with their finances.\nWhen that doesn't happen, a long-standing federal \"hold harmless\" law protects the majority of beneficiaries from having their Social Security payments reduced.\nAlmost 60 million retirees, disabled workers, spouses and children get Social Security benefits.\nMany people who get SSI also receive Social Security."}
