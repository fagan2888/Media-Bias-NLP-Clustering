I am troubled by Ezra\u2019s big inauguratory think piece, but that\u2019s because I think the piece raises a genuine intellectual puzzle.\n\nWhat Ezra does is cite research showing that people understand the world in ways that suit their tribal identities: in controlled experiments both conservatives and liberals systematically misread facts in a way that confirms their biases. And more information doesn\u2019t help: people screen out or discount facts that don\u2019t fit their worldview. Politics, as he says, makes us stupid.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: the lived experience is that this effect is not, in fact, symmetric between liberals and conservatives. Yes, liberals are sometimes subject to bouts of wishful thinking. But can anyone point to a liberal equivalent of conservative denial of climate change, or the \u201cunskewing\u201d mania late in the 2012 campaign, or the frantic efforts to deny that Obamacare is in fact covering a lot of previously uninsured Americans? I don\u2019t mean liberals taking positions you personally disagree with \u2014 I mean examples of overwhelming rejection of something that shouldn\u2019t even be in dispute.\n\nOr look at how liberals reacted to the woes of healthcare.gov. We heard a lot of talk about how it was Obama\u2019s Katrina, or his Iraq. But was there anything like Bush\u2019s \u201checkuva job\u201d moment \u2014 which was matched by widespread insistence on the right that he was actually doing a great job? Was there anything like the years-long denial that anything was going wrong with the Iraq occupation? On the contrary, liberals were quick to acknowledge that the rollout was a disaster, and in fact sort of freaked out \u2014 which, as Noam Scheiber says, is what they usually do in the face of setbacks. And what\u2019s more, as Scheiber says, that\u2019s a good thing: faced with setbacks, liberals rush to fix things, rather than denying the problem. Hence the stunning Obamacare comeback.\n\nAt this point I could castigate Ezra for his both-sides-do-it article \u2014 but instead, let me pose this as a question: why are the two sides so asymmetric? People want to believe what suits their preconceptions, so why the big difference between left and right on the extent to which this desire trumps facts?\n\nOne possible answer would be that liberals and conservatives are very different kinds of people \u2014 that liberalism goes along with a skeptical, doubting \u2014 even self-doubting \u2014 frame of mind; \u201ca liberal is someone who won\u2019t take his own side in an argument.\u201d\n\nAnother possible answer is that it\u2019s institutional, that liberals don\u2019t have the same kind of monolithic, oligarch-financed network of media organizations and think tanks as the right.\n\nWhatever it is, I think it\u2019s important: people are people, but politics doesn\u2019t seem to have the same stupiditizing effect on left and right.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140407170553, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "April 7, 2014", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Asymmetric Stupidity ( 20140407 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "Does politics make us stupid?
