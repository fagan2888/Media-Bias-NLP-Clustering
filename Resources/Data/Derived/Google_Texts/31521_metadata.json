You can be it will figure prominently in the Republican narrative leading up to the 2016 presidential election.\n\nRetired surgeon Ben Carson is one of the many Republicans potentially running for the highest office in the land. He has even gone to Israel to prove he must be taken seriously, saying, \u201cI think having real life experience in the region as opposed to just book learning is extremely helpful in terms of putting things into perspective.\u201d*\n\nMore critically, he has said, like every other Republican presidential candidate in recent years, that he \u201cfeels fingers\u201d from God telling him to run. Remember, Sarah Palin had these, Michele Bachmann had these, Rick Perry had these.\n\nEarlier this month, this potential messiah who prefers real life experience to, say, reading, demanded that Obamacare be put up to a re-vote, writing at World Net Daily that it \u201cwas forced upon the unsuspecting American people through political manipulation and deception.\u201d\n\nMore recently, he denounced Obamacare as unconstitutional on the grounds that it must \u201cpromote the general welfare\u201d of the nation, but does not.\n\nThat is indeed what we find in the preamble to the United States Constitution:\n\nWe the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.\n\nCarson doesn\u2019t see the Affordable Care Act doing that. He says it only helps some people and then only at the expense of others (like subsidies to oil companies, Ben?). So he told Andy Parks of the Washington Times that:\n\n\u201cYour solution should be something that represents all the people. The Constitution says one of the purposes, in the preamble, it says is for the \u2018promote the general welfare.\u2019 What that means is that we do things that help everybody, we don\u2019t pick this group and say, \u2018We\u2019re going to help you at the expense of this group over here.\u2019 That\u2019s not promoting the general welfare so we\u2019re actually violating the Constitution in that sense.\u201d\n\nCarson is contending that Obamacare does not benefit everyone. One wonders if he has actually ever read the law. If he is going to be president, he will have to get used to doing that \u2013 reading legislation. We do realize that Republicans tend not to do such things \u2013 read legislation, listen to speeches, attend important meetings that explain the things they like to complain about. But it really is essential for the leader of the world\u2019s most powerful nation, to have some passing understanding of the things he talks about.\n\nSo let me help Ben out here. Peruse the law\u2019s table of contents and you\u2019ll see the following:\n\nTITLE I\u2014QUALITY, AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR ALL AMERICANS\n\nSubtitle A\u2014Immediate Improvements in Health Care Coverage for All Americans\n\nSubtitle C\u2014Quality Health Insurance Coverage for All Americans\n\nSubtitle D\u2014Available Coverage Choices for All Americans\n\nSubtitle E\u2014Affordable Coverage Choices for All Americans\n\nTITLE X\u2014STRENGTHENING QUALITY, AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR ALL AMERICANS\n\nSo let\u2019s just humor Ben for a moment that the Constitution really means a law must help everybody to be constitutional (I can think of dozens that do not). Oh, well that\u2019s just embarrassing\u2026\n\nNow keep in mind that Carson is the guy who said women\u2019s liberation is to blame for Ferguson, because apparently a woman\u2019s hands were all over a white male cop gunning down an unarmed black youth. Or something. He also said that gay rights and pro-choice activists are \u201cenemies of America\u201d because, you know, when it comes to gays and women, the \u201cgeneral welfare\u201d suddenly does NOT include everybody, but only a few.\n\nAccording to Carson, by trying to extend our liberties to more people, like gays and women, we \u201cincite people to anger and to hatred.\u201d\n\nI get the idea that neither reading nor learning from personal experiences are Ben\u2019s forte. In the vernacular, Ben Carson cannot hold Barack Obama\u2019s jockstrap.\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone seriously considers Ben Carson a frontrunner in 2016. The field is already too full of people just like him. Seriously, if we want to be laughed at by other nations, we can do better, and elect somebody who doesn\u2019t even know where he is, like Rick Perry, or Michele Bachmann. I mean, why not just put Sarah Palin in the White House if that is our goal?\n\nOh, and unlike Pat Robertson or Gordon Klingenschmitt, Ben Carson did make the final four in the 2014 Equine Posterior Award. Consider voting for him, just to let him know he hasn\u2019t been forgotten by us \u201cinciters.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, best get used to the idea of seeing his name pop up more and more in the news. But seriously, GOP? If you\u2019re serious about this whole 2016 thing, you\u2019re going to have to do a whole lot better than this.\n\nNext!\n\nNotes:\n\n* The Washington Post explains that, \u201cOver the years, Israel has become an established campaign stop for many presidential contenders. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. \u2014 who is the object of 2016 speculation despite repeated denials she is planning a White House run \u2014 traveled last month to several Middle Eastern countries, including Israel. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Vice President Joe Biden both visited Israel earlier this year, and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R) has traveled there three times in 2014 alone.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ben Carson thinks Obamacare is unconstitutional because it doesn't help everybody.
