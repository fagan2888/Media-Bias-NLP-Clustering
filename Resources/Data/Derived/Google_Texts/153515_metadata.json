And soon. This current, testing road trip would be a good time to start.\n\nAfter missing three games because of a sore and swollen left index finger, Gonzalez is back in the lineup for Sunday\u2019s rubber match vs. the Braves. He\u2019s hitting cleanup, while Troy Tulowitzki bats third.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cActually, yesterday I took batting practice, and it was feeling good. They just decided to give me an extra day, and I feel good to go.\u201d\n\nCarGo is hopeful that the finger issue clears up and doesn\u2019t become a chronic problem. To that end, he will visit Dr. Thomas Graham, and orthopedic specialist, when the Rockies arrive in Cleveland on Friday.\n\n\u201cThese injuries happen,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing major. It\u2019s just one of those things that hurts, but it\u2019s something that you have to deal (with) and try to fix it with treatment and stuff. But it\u2019s nothing major, which is good.\u201d\n\nGonzalez enters Sunday evening\u2019s game hitting .276 with seven homers, 29 RBIs and an on-base percentage of just .321. Last year at this time, he was hitting .315 with 13 homers and a .397 OPB.\n\nManager Walt Weiss, who said Gonzalez\u2019s finger is something the club will keep close tabs on, is waiting for his left fielder to start raking.\n\n\u201cThis would be a great time for it, with Nolan (Arenado) going down,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cYou know that Gonzalez is going to go crazy here at some point. That is just his track record. This would be a great time for it.\u201d\n\nGonzalez has always been a streaky hitter. Although his bat has heated up a little bit of lately, he hasn\u2019t hit a home run since May 7. He said a hot streak is around the corner.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t gotten to the point where I get a lot of hits and do a lot of damage for that long of a period, but that\u2019s how this game is,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cI just continue to work and I know that\u2019s going to happen soon. I\u2019m not worried about it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even really think about it because I haven\u2019t (worried) in the past, so why should I do it now? That\u2019s how baseball is. Sometimes, it treats you right. Sometimes, it treats you bad.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Nolan Arenado,Walt Weiss", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "After missing three games because of a sore and swollen left index finger, Carlos Gonzalez is back in the lineup for Sunday's rubber match vs. the Braves.", "title": "Rockies' Carlos Gonzalez back in lineup vs. Braves, hoping to get hot", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2014/05/25/rockies-carlos-gonzalez-back-lineup-hoping-get-hot/17648/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2013/07/carlos-gonzalez-495x329.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "After missing three games because of a sore and swollen left index finger, Carlos Gonzalez is back in the lineup for Sunday's rubber match vs. the Braves.", "title": "Rockies\u2019 Carlos Gonzalez back in lineup vs. Braves, hoping to get hot", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2014/05/25/rockies-carlos-gonzalez-back-lineup-hoping-get-hot/17648/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2013/07/carlos-gonzalez-495x329.jpg", "creator": "@psaundersdp", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "After missing three games because of a sore and swollen left index finger, Carlos Gonzalez is back in the lineup for Sunday's rubber match vs. the Braves."}, "article_summary": "After missing three games because of a sore and swollen left index finger, Gonzalez is back in the lineup for Sunday\u2019s rubber match vs. the Braves.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d Gonzalez said.\nATLANTA \u2014 To borrow a phrase from former Colorado skipper Jim Tracy, it would \u201cbehoove\u201d the Rockies if Carlos Gonzalez were to get hot.\n\u201cI just continue to work and I know that\u2019s going to happen soon.\nTo that end, he will visit Dr. Thomas Graham, and orthopedic specialist, when the Rockies arrive in Cleveland on Friday."}
