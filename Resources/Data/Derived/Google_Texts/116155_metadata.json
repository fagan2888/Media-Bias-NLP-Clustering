Yes, President Obama has made the problem much, much worse, but the scary truth is that the national debt keeps rising inexorably no matter who or which party is in office. That\u2019s the new law of American politics.\n\nWhen I first arrived in Washington in the early 1980s, the debt was roughly $2 trillion. This week, 30 years and five presidents later, the debt for the first time exceeded $18 trillion. We have been in the red in all but four of the last 40 years.\n\nThat\u2019s $18,000,000,000,000. We all know that $18 million is a lot of money. This is $18 million times another million. The number is so gigantic we won\u2019t or can\u2019t try to fathom it.\n\nWhy worry? We owe it to ourselves, we\u2019re told. The mighty American economy is big enough to absorb it. This country was built on debt. There is no better time to borrow than when interest rates are at a 40-year low.\n\nThere\u2019s some truth in all these claims. Sure, we have a near\u2013$18 trillion economy, but the problem is that the debt is outgrowing the economy. In just the last seven years \u2014 the last year of George W. Bush\u2019s presidency and the first six of Obama\u2019s \u2014 the debt has increased by roughly $7.4 trillion. That\u2019s ten times the entire debt incurred in our first 200 years as a nation.\n\nMy view is that government debt isn\u2019t inherently evil. The wisdom of borrowing depends on what you use the money for. We borrowed trillions (in today\u2019s dollars) to win World War II. Surely that was worth it. We borrowed another $1.8 trillion during the Reagan years to finance winning the Cold War and rebuilding the private economy with growth-hormone tax cuts. That has clearly benefited future generations \u2014 so they should bear some of the cost.\n\nBut what we have bought with most of our debt of the last two decades has been a bigger, more expansive welfare state. Almost half of all American households, according to the Census Bureau, get a government check or some direct benefit from government today. More than one-third of households get some kind of unearned welfare.\n\nObama called his spend-and-borrow policies a \u201cstimulus.\u201d Really? What do we have to show for Obama\u2019s debt? Solyndra. Forty-six million people on food stamps. The Obamacare debacle. Etc. Etc. This is one of only two times in American history (the post\u2013Vietnam War era is the other) that we have opened up the flood gates on borrowing even as we have severely slashed the military budget.\n\nHere is the biggest worry about an $18 trillion debt: What happens if/when interest rates start to drift back upward? Answer: This is the economic equivalent of the nuclear option.\n\nEach 1-percentage-point rise in interest rates causes the U.S. deficit to rise by more than $1 trillion over ten years. So a 300-basis-point rise in rates \u2014 nothing more than a return to normalcy \u2014 would mean about $5 trillion in federal deficits.\n\nIf that happens, the debt-servicing costs grow astronomically and interest payments would become the biggest expense item in the budget. We start to pay more and more taxes just to finance past borrowing. This is what happened in Detroit; look at how that turned out.\n\nMaybe this debt bubble won\u2019t burst. Let\u2019s pray that it doesn\u2019t. If it does, the 2008\u201309 real-estate crash could look like a picnic by comparison.\n\nThe politicians think they are pulling a fast one here, but the vast majority of Americans feel in their gut that the economy is headed in the wrong direction, in no small part because of this debt time bomb. It explains why Barack Obama\u2019s policies were so thoroughly routed during November\u2019s midterm elections. A great nation doesn\u2019t ring up unpaid bills month after month, year after year, decade after decade. The basic common sense of Americans tells us that you don\u2019t borrow your way to prosperity.\n\nOh, and we\u2019re still borrowing half a trillion a year, so the debt will likely hit $20 trillion sometime before 2018.
