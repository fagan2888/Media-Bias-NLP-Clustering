Brandon did a good job on [Suh]. Morgan did a good job on [Wake]. You know, we just knew we had to keep [quarterback] Kirk [Cousins] clean a few seconds and let him find his receivers downfield and he was going to let the ball go.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: SNYDER: Alfred Morris, potent rushing must continue for Washington\u2019s success\n\nThey foiled Suh with double-teams and cut blocks, especially early, and ran the ball in the direction of Suh and Wake just twice in the first half.

[Offensive line coach Bill] Callahan gave us a plan earlier in the week, and you know, it\u2019s our job to come in and execute it on Sundays.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Scherff and Moses, the inexperienced right side of the Redskins' offensive line, were up to the challenge of facing Ndamukong Suh and Cameron Wake and fared well in the season-opening loss to the Dolphins.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Scherff and Moses, the inexperienced right side of the Redskins\u2019 offensive line, were up to the challenge of facing Ndamukong Suh and Cameron Wake and fared well in the season-opening loss to the Dolphins.", "title": "Brandon Scherff, Morgan Moses pass test against Dolphins\u2019 tough defensive line", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/13/brandon-scherff-morgan-moses-pass-test-against-dol/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/13/AP_645585766505.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/13/AP_645585766505.jpg", "description": "Scherff and Moses, the inexperienced right side of the Redskins' offensive line, were up to the challenge of facing Ndamukong Suh and Cameron Wake and fared well in the season-opening loss to the Dolp", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Brandon Scherff, Morgan Moses pass test against Dolphins\u2019 tough"}, "Author": "Zac Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Morgan Moses"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde260\"", "article_summary": "Second-year right tackle Morgan Moses and rookie right guard Brandon Scherff, the No.\n5 overall pick in April, survived their test against the Miami Dolphins\u2019 duo of defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh, the Dolphins\u2019 marquee free agent signing, and defensive end Cameron Wake.\n\u201cWe were just playing football,\u201d said Moses, who played 12 percent of all offensive snaps last season as a rookie.\nLANDOVER \u2014 What appeared to be a matchup nightmare all week ended up being handled fairly well by the Washington Redskins\u2019 young offensive linemen.\n[Offensive line coach Bill] Callahan gave us a plan earlier in the week, and you know, it\u2019s our job to come in and execute it on Sundays.\u201d"}
