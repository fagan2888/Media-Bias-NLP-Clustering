However, successive administrations have been reluctant to formalize the move, with the Obama administration going so far as to deny that Jerusalem is even in Israel.\n\nDermer told U.S. lawmakers in attendance at the May 29 event organized by the Israel Allies Foundation that it is \u201cfinally\u201d time for the United States to acknowledge Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s \u201cundivided\u201d capital and to relocate the U.S. embassy there.\n\n\u201cWho knows, maybe one day very soon you will decide to move your embassy, finally, to Israel\u2019s capital, Jerusalem,\u201d Dermer said, according to video of his remarks obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. \u201cIn doing so you will not undermine the prospects for peace, you will strengthen the chances for peace because for peace to hold in our region it has to be based on truth.\u201d\n\nWhile Obama administration officials have argued that the status of Jerusalem is an issue that needs to be decided in peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians, Dermer maintained that the issue is about acknowledging \u201cthe connection of the Jewish people to the Jewish land.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe decision in the United States, the decision to move the embassy to Jerusalem, would be a statement in favor of truth and if we have that type of truth, if we make clear to the world the connection of the Jewish people to the Jewish land, the connection of the Jewish people to its capital in Jerusalem, we will be laying a very, very strong, powerful cornerstone for peace,\u201d Dermer said.\n\n\u201cWe all want to see peace happen,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe best way we can do that is by beginning to speak the truth, by defending Jerusalem and defending the eternal connection that we have to our ancient capital.\u201d\n\nWillem Griffioen, the executive director of the Israel Allies Foundation, called Dermer\u2019s comments \u201chistoric.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a historic occasion for Ambassador Dermer to come to Capitol Hill and call on Congress and the U.S. government to move the American Embassy,\u201d Griffioen told the Free Beacon. \u201cI very much second what the ambassador said when he emphasized that for the U.S. to move it\u2019s embassy to Jerusalem would not hinder peace but would strengthen the chances for peace as peace must be rooted in truth.\u201d\n\nDermer\u2019s public call to move the embassy takes direct aim at the Obama administration\u2019s policy on the issue. The White House on Monday reissued an executive waiver to skirt the law and ensure that the embassy is not relocated.\n\nDespite multiple U.S. laws effectively labeling Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and mandating the embassy be moved, the Obama administration has made it a policy to deny that the ancient city is Israeli territory.\n\nState Department releases have dubbed Jerusalem as its own entity and labeled Israel separately.\n\nFormer State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland went on record in 2012 to state that the administration considers Jerusalem a topic for peace talks.\n\n\u201cWith regard to our Jerusalem policy, it\u2019s a permanent-status issue,\u201d she told reporters in 2012 after the State Department came under fire for altering communications that labeled Jerusalem and Israel as separate entities. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be resolved through the negotiations between the parties.\u201d\n\nDemocrats additionally came under fire in 2012 when party leaders removed language from the Democratic National Committee\u2019s platform acknowledging Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital.\n\nLawmakers at last week\u2019s event\u2014including Reps. Brad Sherman (D., Calif.), Eliot Engel (D., N.Y.), and Doug Lamborn (R., Colo.)\u2014reiterated their support for moving the embassy as well.\n\n\u201cI look forward to visiting with you in the new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem,\u201d Sherman told the audience, which included members of Israel\u2019s Knesset and officials from the embassy.\n\nDermer maintained in his remarks that Jerusalem should not be made into a politically divisive issue.\n\n\u201cJerusalem is the heart and soul of the Jewish people,\u201d he said, adding that Jerusalem will never again be divided. \u201cIt is the center of our national life and the center of our religious life and a divided Jerusalem means that your heart is torn.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama administration continues to say Jerusalem not part of Israel", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Israel\u2019s ambassador to the United States has called on Congress to \u201cfinally\u201d and \u201cvery soon\u201d move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, drawing praise from those who have pu", "title": "Israel\u2019s Ambassador: Move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/national-security/israels-ambassador-move-the-u-s-embassy-to-jerusalem/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Jerusalem-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Israel\u2019s ambassador to the United States has called on Congress to \u201cfinally\u201d and \u201cvery soon\ufffd", "title": "Israel\u2019s Ambassador: Move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Jerusalem-150x150.jpg", "creator": "@Kredo0", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddc5f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI look forward to visiting with you in the new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem,\u201d Sherman told the audience, which included members of Israel\u2019s Knesset and officials from the embassy.\nLawmakers have for years tried to move the U.S. embassy in Israel from its location in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\u201cJerusalem is the heart and soul of the Jewish people,\u201d he said, adding that Jerusalem will never again be divided.\nDermer\u2019s public call for Congress to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem is relatively unprecedented for a high level Israeli official and underscores the political controversy over the Obama administration\u2019s refusal to formally acknowledge Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital.\n\u201cWho knows, maybe one day very soon you will decide to move your embassy, finally, to Israel\u2019s capital, Jerusalem,\u201d Dermer said, according to video of his remarks obtained by the Washington Free Beacon."}
