Sanam Jalinous and Asya Sagnak did not hold back, even surprising some other Bwog staffers. Is this Bwog\u2019s next big scandal? CUMB probably hopes so.\n\nBwog isn\u2019t new to taking jabs. Better yet \u2013 Bwog isn\u2019t new to taking jabs, especially from our friends over at CUMB. So, like most students avoiding their exam revision by wandering into Butler 209 at 11:30pm, we decided to brace ourselves for the worst. Twitter open and thumbs warmed-up, we were ready to catch every big bombshell of a joke.\n\nInterestingly, our thumbs weren\u2019t even so much as tired by the time this semester\u2019s Orgo Night reached its 12:40 end. Although the audience was anticipatory and excited as the MC\u2019s yelled out the classic opening lines (we\u2019re sure many lonely CC men spend their days looking forward to the one day a semester where they can shout out \u201cBarnard students, put your vibrators on phone!\u201d as loud as they want), many of the night\u2019s jokes were met with small bursts of quiet, awkward laughter.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say CUMB didn\u2019t provide good content. The band managed to cover all major scandals, starting with Tampongate \u2013 or, as they called it, Menstrual Bloodgazi. The problem, they explained, was that CCSC President Ben \u201cMa-can\u2019t-see-what-pads-are-for\u201d and ESC President Caroline \u201cDidn\u2019t Bother To Explain\u201d Park provided an opportunity for Facebook commenters waiting to jump on a new scandal and pissed off cisgender men who couldn\u2019t comprehend \u201ca discussion that didn\u2019t explicitly require their opinion\u201d.\n\n\n\nColumbia Divest For Climate Justice also saw little to no mercy, being introduced as the \u201clong-standing tradition of a Days On Campus protest.\u201d This section featured one of the most popular jokes of the evening: \u201cwhile you fossil fuel enablers spent your week ditching class, watching Netflix, and bitching about the administration, CDCG heroically fought the system by storming Low\u2026. ditching class, watching Netflix, and bitching about the administration.\u201d In a small quip we personally enjoyed, CUMB jabbed Spec, which, thanks to the protest, \u201ctook a break from beating the dead horse of\u2026 whatever the heck they write about.\u201d\n\nNext up was the segment on sororities (we all knew it was coming), where jabs were thrown at Kappa Alpha Theta \u2013 \u201cKanta Aholda Theirliquor\u201d \u2013and Bwog for the article depicting a screenshot from a sister\u2019s Snapchat revealing alcohol in the brownstone. The genuinity of sorority sisterhood was questioned, comparing the New York Times article commending them for their feminism to \u201cJay-Z getting a husband-of-the-year award\u201d. Ouch! This came with a lovely side-note on Delta Sig, accurately noting that their excessive bragging and masculine overcompensation very easily translates as \u201cI\u2019m totally not into socratic gayboy love.\u201d CUMB also mentioned Bwog\u2019s previous EIC, Mason Amelotte, and his resignation at the hands of the un-censored Theta article. We appreciated our shoutout as \u201cColumbia\u2019s premiere source for Facebook reposts.\u201d Well played, CUMB.\n\nThe band then shifted their focus to Reclining Figure (RF) \u2013 the \u201cart\u201d that\u2019s about to bless the small patch of green in front Butler Library. Their opening comments about the much-talked, much-hated statue were refreshingly accurate: \u201cFuck all of you for making this a big enough deal that we actually had to write about it.\u201d This introduction was probably what resonated most with the evening\u2019s crowd, clearly tired of seeing the same two opposing opinions stated over and over again in op-ed form. Both students and the administration were addressed as the MC\u2019s roasted students who are \u201ctoo afraid of any minor change in their life\u201d and administrators who thought it would be a good idea to put a female figure in front of a building \u201cwith less diversity than a Harvard social club\u201d. We\u2019re always up for shade on the big Crimson, but we\u2019re not exactly sure how this line of logic follows \u2013 wouldn\u2019t the Reclining Figure\u2019s femininity help diversify the building? The better joke in this section was that RF, just like Columbia students, is about to \u201cget fucked by the administration.\u201d\n\nFinally, the band addressed Barnard as a whole. They started by bashing the Facebook group \u201cOverheard at Barnard,\u201d which got Columbia\u2019s attention with the ironically not overheard picture of the Barnard student who slept with half of the Bacchanal headliner, Rae Sremmurd. As the audience howled in laughter, the band targeted Barnard\u2019s new access to JJ\u2019s place and claimed that that was the reason Malia picked Harvard was because of her mother\u2019s \u201cwar on fat kids\u201d and lack of Barnard administrative prowess \u2013 \u201cObamacare, but Barnard no care.\u201d Love for Malia in the upcoming first-year class was also addressed, as CUMB mentioned the Barnard 2020 Facebook group\u2019s disappointment at not being able to \u201chold Malia\u2019s hair back the first time she has to puke in a Sulz toilet.\u201d\n\nComedy-wise, the night featured many relevant high-points. The MC\u2019s were skillful in their delivery, and diligent in the face of adversary \u2013 one man started playing loud music and shouting in the very beginning, and the presenters kept on speaking over him and shut him down by asking him to step down because \u201canything (they\u2019ll) say will be infinitely better\u201d. This being said, many of the smaller jokes at Orgo Night did fall flat, excelling more in delivery than content and relying much too heavily on toilet humor. Unfortunately, like the Varsity Show it criticized, Orgo Night strove to cover so much content that (due to the lack of cohesive transitions) that most of their jokes felt like random punchlines delivered at the end of each paragraph of script.\n\nAll in all, this Orgo Night did a very good job at one thing: providing campus satire while trying to stay out of the bounds of offense. While some people are always going to find Orgo Night insulting due to its nature and history, we can\u2019t remember many moments where a harsh or unnecessary jab was made just for the sake of shock value laughter. All comments, no matter how valid, had some sort of political drive \u2013 the biggest victim of the night was the administration, which probably deserves all the criticism it gets. Clearly, this is a purposeful shift from the band. With a very large audience and hard-working minds behind the scenes, Orgo Night actually has an opportunity to hold the administration (and students) to a better standard. Although it\u2019s only been one show, we hope this marks a shift in CUMB\u2019s mindset of seeing the night more as a platform for relatable Columbia socio-political satire than just an opportunity to attack people by yelling into a microphone.\n\nTags: catch us dancing on butler 407 tabletops, cumb, it's ok maybe y'all just had a bad crowd theatre gets it all the time, not today that's for gd sure, orgo night, thanks for catering to our high school musical needs, THE MUSIC WAS GREAT, wait is it tho, we wonder when writing became a prerequisite to join a band, we're all in this together? sometimes?, when even is the organic chem final", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Bwog", "description": "\u2026", "title": "Orgo Night: A New Direction?", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1334, "identifier": "http://images.bwog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/13184744_10209317838765313_1116707848_o.jpg", "height": 1000}, "url": "http://bwog.com/2016/05/06/orgo-night-a-new-direction/", "type": "article"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"app_id": 147610948756097}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thebwog", "published_time": "2016-05-06T20:08:37+00:00", "author": "http://bwog.com/author/bwogstaff/", "section": "Articles", "modified_time": "2016-05-07T17:48:21+00:00", "tag": "when even is the organic chem final"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=0;"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3314\"", "article_summary": "Per Bwog tradition, we sent two fresh-faced first-years to review Orgo Night.\nInterestingly, our thumbs weren\u2019t even so much as tired by the time this semester\u2019s Orgo Night reached its 12:40 end.\nBetter yet \u2013 Bwog isn\u2019t new to taking jabs, especially from our friends over at CUMB.\nSanam Jalinous and Asya Sagnak did not hold back, even surprising some other Bwog staffers.\nAll in all, this Orgo Night did a very good job at one thing: providing campus satire while trying to stay out of the bounds of offense."}
