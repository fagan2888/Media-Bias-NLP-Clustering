Saturday was a day for health nuts, as a variety of organizations were hosting health fairs or forums. Agape Storehouse spent most of Saturday morning, mentoring to those who participated in a health forum.

First Lady Linda Faye Willis says the importance of this forum was to inspire and encourage people to take better care of themselves each day, instead of waiting for health problems to sneak up on them.

"We're encouraging them to be proactive versus reactive," Willis said. "Sometimes we don't tend to take better care of ourselves until we've gotten a bad report. We're giving them the necessary tools to take charge to know what to do."

Willis said they focused on good hygiene and diabetes throughout the day.
