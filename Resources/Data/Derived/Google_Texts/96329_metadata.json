He publicly criticized the NSA\u2019s citizen spying programs and even announced that he would not be using his email, convinced that the NSA was spying on him. In an interview with NBC in 2014, Carter stated:\n\n\u201c\u2026 I have felt that my own communications are probably monitored. And when I want to communicate with a foreign leader privately, I type or write the letter myself, put it in the post office, and mail it.\u201d\n\nPresident Carter has even gone on record saying that if given the position, he would consider pardoning Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor wanted for the distribution of classified data. Now, once again, he\u2019s gone loud with his political positions.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nPresident Carter appeared as a guest on The Thom Hartmann Program, a nationally broadcasted radio show, and dropped a serious bomb on modern policy. When asked about the supreme court\u2019s ruling to allow unlimited corporate spending in politics, Carter had this to say:\n\n\u201cIt violates the essence of what made America a great country in its political system. Now it\u2019s just an oligarchy, with unlimited political bribery being the essence of getting the nominations for president or to elect the president. And the same thing applies to governors, and U.S. senators and congress members. So now we\u2019ve just seen a complete subversion of our political system as a payoff to major contributors, who want and expect and sometimes get favors for themselves after the election\u2019s over\u2026 The incumbents, Democrats, and Republicans, look upon this unlimited money as a great benefit to themselves. Somebody who\u2019s already in Congress has a lot more to sell to an avid contributor than somebody who\u2019s just a challenger.\u201d\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with the term \u201coligarchy\u201d, it simply means that our country is run by a very small group of very rich people. And while it\u2019s nice to hear somebody other than activists and conspiracy theorists talk about the United States oligarchy, of course, it had to come from one of the most detested politicians in America.\n\nWhile this statement may seem drastic in the face of blanket media coverage which says America is a free democracy, a major study from Princeton has come to the same conclusion.\n\nPresident Carter doesn\u2019t stand alone as a politician admitting that money controls politics. Even Vice President Joe Biden ironically admitted that money fuels politics.\n\n\u201cYou have to go where the money is. Now where the money is, there\u2019s almost always implicitly some string attached [\u2026] It\u2019s awful hard to take a whole lot of money from a group you know has a particular position then you conclude they\u2019re wrong [and] vote no.\u201d\n\nThe 29-term congressman John Dingell had some heavy words before his retirement on spending in politics as well:\n\n\u201cAllowing people and corporate interest groups and others to spend an unlimited amount of unidentified money has enabled certain individuals to swing any and all elections, whether they are congressional, federal, local, state [\u2026] rarely are these people having goals which are in line with those of the general public. History well shows that there is a very selfish game that\u2019s going on and that our government has largely been put up for sale.\u201d\n\nIt is sad, yes, that our political system has simply become a business model with fatal expenses, but does it actually come as a surprise? When one considers how closely media and politics are linked today and the fact that a total of 6 companies control 90% of the media outlets in America, does it actually come as a surprise? When the same people that bring you fiction on HBO bring you \u201creality\u201d on CNN (Time Warner) does it actually come as a surprise?\n\nPeople can look at Jimmy Carter as one of the worst presidents in history all they want. In this case, he\u2019s right. Our politics are not fueled by morals, values, or the good of the American people, but rather the weight of our politicians\u2019 wallets. The sooner we come to grips with this, the sooner we can stop just pointing fingers at Obama as if he\u2019s the sole master orchestrator of America\u2019s shit-show of a political system. Want to start getting good and honest politicians in office? Kicking corporate influence out of the system would be a fantastic start.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jimmy Carter: America Has Become An Oligarchy", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Josh Mur | AntiMedia", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Jimmy Carter: America Has Become An Oligarchy", "title": "Jimmy Carter: America Has Become An Oligarchy", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/jimmy-carter-america-has-become-an-oligarchy/208191/", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Jimmy.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-31T13:24:34-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jimmy Carter: America Has Become An Oligarchy", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Jimmy.jpg", "title": "Jimmy Carter: America Has Become An Oligarchy", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Snowden", "published_time": "2015-08-01T05:00:19-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-31T13:24:34-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "Jimmy Carter: America Has Become An Oligarchy\u201cNow it\u2019s just an oligarchy, with unlimited political bribery being the essence of getting the nominations for president or to elect the president.\"\nNow it\u2019s just an oligarchy, with unlimited political bribery being the essence of getting the nominations for president or to elect the president.\nAnd while it\u2019s nice to hear somebody other than activists and conspiracy theorists talk about the United States oligarchy, of course, it had to come from one of the most detested politicians in America.\nWhen asked about the supreme court\u2019s ruling to allow unlimited corporate spending in politics, Carter had this to say:\u201cIt violates the essence of what made America a great country in its political system.\nPresident Carter doesn\u2019t stand alone as a politician admitting that money controls politics."}
