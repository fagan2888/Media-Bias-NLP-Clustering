Or worse, emergency calls blocked by jammed cellphone towers unable to handle the volume.\n\nThose are among the fears as hundreds of thousands of mobile phone-wielding fans get ready to attend soccer\u2019s premier event in Brazil.\n\nExperts say Cup visitors will discover that Brazil\u2019s mobile communications services are severely lacking, mostly because the government and telephone companies are ill-prepared for the month-long tournament. Some even worry about possible mobile network blackouts.\n\nEven under the best conditions, voice calls often drop and accessing the Internet on a smartphone is mind-numbingly slow. As last year\u2019s protests during the Confederations Cup demonstrated, it can be impossible to use mobile services in a big crowd in a packed soccer stadium.\n\nGovernment investment was supposed to remedy the problem before the World Cup. Leaders promised blazing-fast 4G mobile networks in the 12 cities hosting the matches, but that didn\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned from the Confederations Cup, and put specific trucks outside the stadium to enhance the connectivity,\u201d said Thierry Weil, FIFA\u2019s marketing director. \u201cBut at the end of the day, to be honest, having 70,000 in a stadium, where everybody wants to make a phone call at halftime, well, I\u2019d say you better talk to your boyfriend or girlfriend ahead of the game.\u201d\n\nIn a worst-case scenario, the mobile communications systems could be so overloaded that people may not be able to call first responders in an emergency, said Christopher Gaffney, a visiting professor at Rio\u2019s Federal Fluminense University whose research focuses on Brazil\u2019s preparations for the World Cup and Olympics.\n\n\u201cWorld Cup visitors won\u2019t be able to communicate the way they want to,\u201d said Gaffney. \u201cInstagram, Twitter, social media will not function at world class levels but at Brazilian levels, so people visiting Brazil will experience the frustrations we face every day.\u201d\n\nThe problems with Brazil\u2019s mobile services have emerged as demand has soared while the infrastructure for delivering them failed to keep pace.\n\nThere are more than 272 million active cellphone lines in the country of 200 million people, according to the telecommunications regulator Anatel. The resulting spotty coverage makes telecommunications among Brazil\u2019s most loathed industries.\n\nTelephone companies blame municipal governments for what they say is excessive red tape required to construct more cellphone towers to improve mobile services. But government officials complain that the telecommunications companies have greedily signed up tens of millions of Brazil\u2019s new middle-class consumers without adequately improving infrastructure.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Brazil\u2019s weak service makes WCup Tweets unlikely", "title": "Brazil\u2019s weak service makes WCup Tweets unlikely", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Brazil\u2019s weak service makes WCup Tweets unlikely", "title": "Brazil\u2019s weak service makes WCup Tweets unlikely", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/24/brazils_weak_service_makes_wcup_tweets_unlikely/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/brazil-world-cup-mobile-phone-failures.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Brazil\u2019s weak service makes WCup Tweets unlikely", "title": "Brazil\u2019s weak service makes WCup Tweets unlikely", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/brazil-world-cup-mobile-phone-failures.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Luis Andres Henao", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd4b5\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWorld Cup visitors won\u2019t be able to communicate the way they want to,\u201d said Gaffney.\nBut government officials complain that the telecommunications companies have greedily signed up tens of millions of Brazil\u2019s new middle-class consumers without adequately improving infrastructure.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsRIO DE JANEIRO (AP) \u2014 Ecstatic football fans unable to celebrate a World Cup win with real-time Tweets, or post \u201cselfies\u201d of themselves from inside stadiums.\nExperts say Cup visitors will discover that Brazil\u2019s mobile communications services are severely lacking, mostly because the government and telephone companies are ill-prepared for the month-long tournament.\nGovernment investment was supposed to remedy the problem before the World Cup."}
