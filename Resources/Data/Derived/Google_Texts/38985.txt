MANILA, Philippines (AP) â€” Police in a central Philippine city have filed multiple murder complaints against the owner and the crew of a ferry that capsized shortly after pulling out of port, leaving more than 50 dead.

Senior Inspector Rio Tan of the Ormoc City police says the complaints were filed with the local prosecutor late Friday as the 36-ton M/B Kim Nirvana was lifted from the water.

Regional coast guard commander Capt. Pedro Tinampay said Saturday that at least 59 died and 145 survived, including all 18 crew members.

Tinampay says a marine investigation has begun and it will also determine how many people actually were aboard the vessel.

The ferry overturned minutes after pulling out of the port on its voyage Thursday to an island to the south.
