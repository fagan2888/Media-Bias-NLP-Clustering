Disney-ABC Television Group chief Ben Sherwood wants to impose a radical-left agenda on their cable and broadcast networks, and according to that plan, they are making great progress.\n\nWhile ABC has exercised strict control over content in its prime-time shows favoring conservatives \u2013 the network forced Last Man Standing, executive produced by and starring Tim Allen, to alter a joke accusing Barack Obama of having Communist tendencies \u2013 it has openly embraced progressive propaganda elsewhere. For example, the network\u2019s Thursday night lineup is almost exclusively produced by noted liberal Shonda Rhimes, has plenty of objectionable dialogue. In a recent episode of the hit show Scandal, for example, a main character is depicted as delivering this \u201ccommentary\u201d on the state of education:\n\nA college degree is as essential today as a high-school diploma was 100 years ago. The world is changing, and we have got to change with it. That means that our state colleges and universities should be free for every high-school graduate. My education bill \u2014 it\u2019s not revolutionary or radical. It simply finishes what we\u2019ve been working on in this great state for over 300 years \u2014 the principle of free education was established in the Pennsylvania constitution of 1790, and in the 1830s, we were one of the first states in the country to actually establish a public-education system. Now, that\u2019s the Pennsylvania my parents moved to. That\u2019s the Pennsylvania I grew up in. That is your Pennsylvania. Smart, generous, civic-minded, forward-thinking\u2026 Right.\n\nWalt Disney Co. CEO Bob Iger met with stockholders back in 2014, and there was near revolt from one person when it came to the TV division, especially the ABC network \u2013 which includes ABC News. That\u2019s no surprise, as at the time of the meeting, ABC was (and still is) in last place in terms of competition between the big broadcast networks. The National Free Enterprise Project\u2019s Justin Danhof was at that meeting:\n\nDANHOF: In 2009, before the Affordable Care Act became law, Charlie Gibson did an ABC News \u201cFact Check\u201d segment on President Obama\u2019s \u201cIf you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan\u201d promise. ABC reported that critics questioning the President\u2019s pledge were wrong to do so. That\u2019s the pledge that later was awarded PolitiFact\u2019s \u201cLie of the Year\u201d \u2013 but by then ObamaCare was already law of the land. President Obama has apologized and said he is \u201csorry\u201d to those who thought they could keep their health insurance \u201cbased on assurances\u201d they got from him. Do you wish to say anything right now to the millions of people who unexpectedly lost their insurance \u2013 perhaps apologize for the role ABC News played in causing that harm? IGER: I actually stand by ABC News, who I believe not only presents the news in a fair and balanced manner, but behaves in a high integrity kind of way. While there are times that critics have come forward and pointed out mistakes they have made, overall, the quality of our news is something we should be proud of.\n\nIn Iger\u2019s defense, his top priority was bringing Disney\u2019s aging animation division up to date, which he has done to a great extent with recent hits like Frozen, and through Disney\u2019s continued partnership with John Lasseter and Pixar Animation Studios (who, incidentally, oversaw Iger\u2019s animation revamp). Still, Iger should stop denying what Sherwood and his George Soros-funded cronies are doing to the once-great ABC brand. While most television execs would have stopped ABC\u2019s liberal bleed long ago, for fear of alienating conservative viewers, Sherwood seems to be looking for a payoff from the liberal bent \u2013 bringing ABC further and further to the left in the hopes that it sparks loyalty among liberals. According to Fox News Channel\u2019s John Gibson, the network has gone so far as to team up with former Obama administration official and Democratic campaign operative Kal Penn to create a sitcom bashing that high-rated cable channel, perhaps hoping to influence people\u2019s opinion of 2016 election coverage.\n\nAnd, of course ABC would benefit. It\u2019s not a stretch to assume that Sherwood and his mostly liberal colleagues would want to help out Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders as much as possible. Iger started his career at ABC: perhaps its time he confronts Sherwood and lets him know that his gamble, turning ABC into a propaganda network pushing a liberal agenda, won\u2019t pay off. After all, in its quest to influence politics and social issues, ABC\u2019s failure would tarnish not just an established television network, but the reputation of Walt Disney\u2019s namesake brand. It\u2019s time for Mr. Iger to hold Mr. Sherwood accountable.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "After all, in its quest to influence politics and social issues, ABC\u2019s failure would tarnish not just an established television network, but the reputation of Walt Disney\u2019s namesake brand.\nWalt Disney Co.
