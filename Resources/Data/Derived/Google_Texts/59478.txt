A pair of crooks robbed a man of his vehicle at gunpoint early Sunday morning in a residential area of north Wichita.

Wichita police say the call came in from the 57-year-old victim at about 2:30 a.m. He told officers two men confronted him in the 2200 block of N Grove demanding he turn over his 1999 white Mercury Grand Marquis with dealer tags.

The victim saying one of the robbers -- a 36-year-old man he knows -- pointed a gun at him during the robbery, before the thieves drove off in the vehicle.

No one was hurt. Police did not give an age or a description of the second suspect.

Police are asking anyone with information on this crime, or who sees the stolen vehicle to call 911.
