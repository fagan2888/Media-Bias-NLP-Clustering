And one rival of the ride-hailing giant is positioning itself to take advantage of that tension.\n\nGett, which bills itself as \u201cNYC\u2019s Black Car App,\u201d has updated its app to make hailing one of its cars much easier for blind and visually impaired passengers. The update, available on iOS and Android, lets visually impaired passengers use the baked-in voice guided features on smartphone operating systems to access its functions for hailing a ride. Users can also schedule a ride in advance.\n\nGett also says its drivers know to allow guide dogs in their cars. The company collaborated with 17-year-old Adi Kushner\u2014a developer who\u2019s also helped companies such as Apple and Google integrate accessibility features into their products\u2014as well as the Center for the Blind in Israel to come up with the new features for the app.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about tech, we usually talk about why it\u2019s so great and brings efficiency\u2014how it saves time and money,\u201d Gett CEO Shahar Waiser tells WIRED. \u201cBut there are people who actually depend on tech to get help, and these new features are really built for them.\u201d\n\nBut the features also seem designed, intentionally or not, to take a jab at Uber. In September, the National Federation of the Blind of California filed a suit against Uber, complaining that blind riders with service animals were denied service on the platform. Both parties are currently trying to sort out the matter in private mediation, but in the meantime a judge said the suit could go forward.\n\nUber has seemingly sought to rehabilitate its reputation by launching several programs and features of its own to make rides more accessible to more people. Yesterday, it announced it was launching a new program for senior citizens and disabled riders in Los Angeles called UberAssist that offers specially trained drivers and vehicles that can accommodate wheelchairs, walkers, and scooters. And in May, the company unveiled app updates to help its deaf drivers.\n\nAt the same time, Uber has also argued in court that as a technology company, it should not be subject to laws that regulate disability access for public transportation services like taxis, buses or trains.\n\n\u201cUber has a non-discrimination policy applicable to riders and drivers and seeks to make transportation options available to all individuals,\u201d an Uber spokeswoman told WIRED in an email. Drivers are expected to comply with local, state, and federal laws, she said, adding that Uber tells drivers they must comply with Americans with Disabilities Act requirements and provides them with information on best practices for accommodating people with disabilities.\n\nWhatever Uber\u2019s current conflicts, any effort by ride-hailing companies to improve services and accessibility for riders and drivers is a good thing. Lyft is already known for its active community of deaf drivers. While Gett lacks the scale of either of these companies, its announcement still ups the pressure on bigger companies to act on accessibility issues.\n\nKushner tells WIRED that ultimately his goal isn\u2019t just to build out whole new standalone apps for the disabled community. Rather he wants to code and develop for platforms overall with features are easily transferable from app to app. \u201cImproving accessibility not only helps the blind, it helps everyone,\u201d he says.\n\nUPDATE (July 15, 2015, 3:14 PM ET): In a statement to WIRED, Uber said that its work with the visually impaired includes partnerships with organizations such as the National Federation of the Blind and LightHouse for the Blind in San Francisco. The company said it has also released a podcast for riders on how to use the Uber App\u2019s VoiceOver iOS feature.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.wired.com/wp-content/themes/Phoenix/assets/images/favicon_ie.png", "Section": "Blog", "description": "Gett is positioning itself\u00a0to take advantage of that tension between Uber and blind passengers.", "application-name": "WIRED: WIRED", "Author": "Davey Alba", "og": {"site_name": "WIRED", "description": "Gett is positioning itself\u00a0to take advantage of that tension between Uber and blind passengers.", "title": "If Uber Doesn\u2019t Want to Accommodate Blind Riders, Gett Will", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/20140605-TOP-APP-REVIEWS-TEMPLATE-1200x630-e1436918714315.jpg", "height": 630}, "url": "http://www.wired.com/2015/07/uber-doesnt-want-accommodate-blind-riders-gett-will/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "WIRED", "description": "Gett is positioning itself\u00a0to take advantage of that tension between Uber and blind passengers.", "title": "If Uber Doesn\u2019t Want to Accommodate Blind Riders, Gett Will", "image": {"src": "http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/20140605-TOP-APP-REVIEWS-TEMPLATE-660x440.jpg"}, "creator": "@wired", "site": "@wired", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#cb0004", "msapplication-tooltip": "Read in-depth coverage of current and future trends in technology, and how they are shaping business, entertainment, communications, science, politics, and culture at Wired.com.", "gmapkey": "ABQIAAAAF5yd_X_vTzike6sB6lp3wBQ4h890iMeKvsDZGQOc75SG0lWKAhQW755bw9E_-3ijKe6eqE5sg_NLEw", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373903654", "fb": {"page_id": 19440638720}, "Subsection": "WIRED", "DisplayDate": "2015-07-15", "robots": "index, follow", "article": {"section": "Business", "tag": "Uber"}, "ExpiryDate": "2060-12-31", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"If Uber Doesn\u2019t Want to Accommodate Blind Riders, Gett Will\", \"link\": \"http://www.wired.com/2015/07/uber-doesnt-want-accommodate-blind-riders-gett-will/\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/20140605-TOP-APP-REVIEWS-TEMPLATE-150x150-e1436918535849.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1809802\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-07-15T07:00:52+00:00\", \"section\": \"WIRED\", \"author\": \"Davey Alba\", \"tags\": [\"accessibility\",\"gett\",\"Lyft\",\"on-demand economy\",\"Uber\"]}", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimal-ui, shrink-to-fit=no", "news_keywords": "accessibility, gett, Lyft, on-demand economy, Uber"}, "article_summary": "In September, the National Federation of the Blind of California filed a suit against Uber, complaining that blind riders with service animals were denied service on the platform.\nThe company said it has also released a podcast for riders on how to use the Uber App\u2019s VoiceOver iOS feature.\n\u201cUber has a non-discrimination policy applicable to riders and drivers and seeks to make transportation options available to all individuals,\u201d an Uber spokeswoman told WIRED in an email.\nBlind passengers are just one of the many groups with whom Uber has tangled recently.\nWhatever Uber\u2019s current conflicts, any effort by ride-hailing companies to improve services and accessibility for riders and drivers is a good thing."}
