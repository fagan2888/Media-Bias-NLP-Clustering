The 28-year-old now dates one of the most famous women in entertainment.\n\n\"He doesn't have a lot of structure. He can be irresponsible,\" Minaj, 33, testified last week. \"Since I've come in his life, I think I've been working on that a little bit. ... He's just getting accustomed to being an adult.\"\n\nHe said he has dropped old friends from his entourage to focus on his family and girlfriend. His lawyer said he and Minaj were seriously discussing marriage.\n\nThe lawyer blamed the problems on the chaos of the music industry. The latest rules required Mill to get travel vouchers before he leaves town and meet with his probation officer in Philadelphia every 60 days.\n\n\"He's not a person who knows how to keep schedules. He's not an accountant. He's an artist,\" argued his latest lawyer, Frank DeSimone. \"And those people are notoriously slipshod (at organization).\"\n\nThe violations include Mill's performances at a New York benefit concert last month and, according to prosecutors, efforts to meet up in various cities with Minaj. Brinkley also raised questions about a suspicious sample during a drug test. Mill denied trying to thwart the test or taking any drugs. He also dissed the case prosecutor in a rap song, a decision he now calls \"immature.\"\n\nMill told the judge he was so concerned about the rules that he missed being at his mother's bedside after a recent surgery in New Jersey. The state, Brinkley explained, was keeping supervised felons out that day amid heightened security for the Miss America pageant.\n\n\"This court has done nothing but try to help the defendant,\" she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Meek Mill faces potential prison time over parole violations - AP News: PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 A judge appears likely to send rapper .05/27/2016 5:29:06AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 A judge appears likely to send rapper Meek Mill back behind bars", "title": "AP News - Meek Mill faces potential prison time over parole violations", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/entertainment/2015/12/17/meek-mill-hopes-to-avoid-jail-over-probation-issues-n2094781", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015\\351\\c37700a1-532b-4a3b-9e1a-a9b5d6aa73bf.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 A judge appears likely to send rapper Meek Mill back behind bars", "title": "AP News - Meek Mill faces potential prison time over parole violations", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/entertainment/2015/12/17/meek-mill-hopes-to-avoid-jail-over-probation-issues-n2094781", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/351/c37700a1-532b-4a3b-9e1a-a9b5d6aa73bf.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Meek Mill faces potential prison time over parole violations, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "But Common Pleas Judge Genece Brinkley, who had spared him state prison in a 2009 drug and gun case, had heard it all before.\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 A judge appears likely to send rapper Meek Mill back behind bars early next year for a steady stream of probation violations, most involving his failure to keep the court aware of his erratic travels.\nMill served short stints in jail and home confinement following his conviction, when he could have gotten five to 10 years in prison.\nThe state, Brinkley explained, was keeping supervised felons out that day amid heightened security for the Miss America pageant.\nMill, born Robert Williams, lost his father to violence when he was 5 and left school in the tenth grade."}
