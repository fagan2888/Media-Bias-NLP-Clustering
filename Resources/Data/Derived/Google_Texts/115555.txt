Notices went out Friday to families in Denver who participated in the school district’s choice process, and according to Denver Public Schools, about 78 percent of the nearly 25,000 students who participated got their first pick.

About 95 percent of all the participating students got one of their five picks for the next school year, DPS officials said in a news release. It marks a year with higher participation rates and higher match rates than in previous years.

In 2014, about 76 percent of all students got into one of their top picks, according to a recent report on the district’s school choice process from A-Plus Denver, a nonprofit advocacy group.

For those who didn’t get into any of their top choices, or those who want to change their mind, a second-round application process begins next week.

The number of students who participated in selecting a school increased this year by 9.8 percent over last year, with the biggest increases in the southwest and west middle school zones.

DPS created the zones this year, guaranteeing priority enrollment for students in those zones to any of the area middle schools. Families in the enrollment zones must select a school through the choice process because the district will not assign them to any school automatically.
