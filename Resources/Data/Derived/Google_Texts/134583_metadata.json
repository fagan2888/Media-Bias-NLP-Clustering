Long ones and short ones. Times when the deceased left their families with precise instructions for their care and burial, and times when they did not.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen families be torn apart. I\u2019ve seen it professionally; I\u2019ve seen it personally,\u201d Holden said.\n\nHolden works as a care transitions coach in St. Louis, helping people who are preparing to move into nursing homes lay out their end-of-life wishes for their loved ones and doctors to follow. This includes directives for medical care: Should doctors continue to administer emergency care, regardless of how long it will extend your life? Where do you want to be when you die \u2014 at home, in a hospital bed, or somewhere else?\n\n\u201cIf you just have that dialogue, it prevents people from having guilt: Did I make the right choice? I hope I didn\u2019t do something too soon, or did I do it too late?\u201d Holden said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot. That\u2019s a heaviness to have on you.\u201d\n\nListen to Durrie's radio story on how to talk about the end of life.\n\nOn Tuesday, a Boston-based nonprofit called The Conversation Project will hold a free workshop in St. Louis about how to discuss end-of-life care with a loved one. Holden is part of the local committee from the University of Missouri that is organizing the event.\n\n\u201cSometimes, if you just have these conversations lightheartedly, whether it\u2019s dinner or you\u2019re just hanging out, the more you have it the easier it gets,\u201d Holden said. \u201cIt won\u2019t feel like such a morbid conversation.\u201d\n\nThe Conversation Project\u2019s goal is to increase the number of people who have end-of-life conversations with family members before a crisis strikes. Though polls show that up to 70 percent of Americans say they would prefer to die at home, only 22 percent actually do.\n\nA 2010 study found only one in four American adults had an advanced directive for how they wish to receive care at the end of life (another study estimated one in three). Around that same time, a provision in the Affordable Care Act that reimbursed physicians for providing end-of-life counseling to Medicare patients sparked heated cries of \u201cdeath panels\u201d from Republicans.\n\nBut in recent years, the public push to make living wills and advanced directives a common practice has become stronger.\n\n\u201cDefinitely in the past couple years, it\u2019s been more in the public eye. These discussions have become more nuanced,\u201d said Dr. Maria Dans, a palliative care physician who works in an intensive care unit at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis.\n\nPalliative physicians like Dans come into the picture when a patient has a life-threatening illness or a chronic disease, when medical care shifts from searching for a cure, to helping a person maintain their quality of life for as long as they wish. Often, an advanced directive or living will can offer a roadmap for physicians if patients are unable to make their own medical decisions. But if a patient hasn\u2019t expressed his or her wishes, even in casual conversations with family members, it can be challenging.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still probably things that bring them joy in life, and we can try to elucidate what those are. If what you want is sitting on your porch with your dog and having a beer, we need to know about that beforehand,\u201d Dans said.\n\nAmericans spend a disproportionate amount of money on health-care costs at the end of life. One study by the Veterans Administration found that acute hospital services accounted for 78 percent of a patient\u2019s health-care costs during the final 30 days of life, an average of about $34,000 a person. Another study of terminal cancer patients who reported having end-of-life discussions with their physicians found that their overall health-care costs would be lower during their last week of life.\n\nBut individually, it\u2019s not the money that matters. In 2000, another VA study that Dans cited asked terminal patients, family members and caregivers to rank what they thought were most important to patients as they reached the end of their life.\n\n\u201cThe caregivers thought, what\u2019s most important is more time and less pain and suffering. But the patients actually ranked clarity of mind and not being a burden; setting oneself right with god and your family much higher than they did physical pain and suffering or even more time,\u201d Dans said.\n\nDans said that if the study tells her anything, it\u2019s that sometimes we can be wrong about what our loved ones want. Sometimes doctors can be wrong, too. The end of life is an emotional time.\n\n\u201cMany people who go into medicine, go into medicine to fix stuff. And if that\u2019s your mentality, it\u2019s hard to step out of that,\u201d Dans said. \u201cParticularly with physicians who have had a really long term relationship with their patients. They\u2019re almost like additional family members.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to talking about dying, there are strategies that can help, said Adrienne Holden, the care transitions coach. The Conversation Project and the Missouri attorney general\u2019s office both have \u201cstarter kits\u201d that are free to download.\n\n\u201cI use the word, 'respect.' I use the word, 'wishes,' and I use words like 'honor.' And it seems to help,\u201d Holden said.\n\nFor Holden, the situation is personal. Recently, her father\u2019s health started to decline. Five years ago, her brother died from complications with sickle cell anemia, but with all his \u201cducks in a row,\u201d she said.\n\nHolden\u2019s 71-year-old mother, Pearl Holden, surprised her when she asked Holden to help her write an advance directive after the death of her son.\n\n\u201cHe had a strong outlook on life, and a positive outlook on afterlife,\u201d Pearl Holden said. \u201cI want that too.\u201d\n\nPearl spent her career building parts for airplane wings for companies in St. Louis, raising her two children with her husband Marvin \u2014 a good life, she says. Today, she\u2019s retired, in excellent health and bakes cakes from scratch.\n\n\u201cI felt it was important for my child, my daughter-in-law and them to know my wishes. To keep the burden off of them; to know it\u2019s alright. It\u2019s alright for you all to have your moments of grief but still life goes on,\u201d Pearl said, sitting at her kitchen table in Florissant on a sunny afternoon.\n\nEven if it\u2019s far away, Pearl said she thinks death is a conversation more people should have.\n\n\u201cI think they fear if they talk about it, it\u2019s going to happen. But if you don\u2019t talk about it, it\u2019s still going to happen.\u201d\n\nIf you go:\n\nThe Conversation Project Event will be held Tuesday, September 29, from 7 to 9:30 p.m. at the Ethical Society of St. Louis.
