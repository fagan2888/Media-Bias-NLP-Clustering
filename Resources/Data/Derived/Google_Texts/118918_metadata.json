When I held an object, I could feel if it was soft or hard, round or square.\u201d\n\nThe bionic hand, which was developed by researchers at EPFL in Switzerland and SSSA in Italy, processes real-time sensory information by measuring tension in the artificial tendons that control finger movements, allowing the user\u2019s brain to interpret tactile information. These signals travel through four electrodes that are implanted and connected to the upper arm nerves. Although the developers were initially worried that S\u00f8rensen\u2019s nerves had lost their edge over nine years of inactivity, the first trial was a success.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time in neuroprosthetics that sensory feedback has been restored and used by an amputee in real-time to control an artificial limb,\u201d Dr. Silvestro Micera, director of the Translational Neural Engineering Laboratory at EPFL and lead developer of the technology, said in a press release.\n\nThe next step is to fine-tune the tremendously complex processes whereby the innovation \u201ctranslates\u201d sensory input to information that can be picked up by nerves and understood by the brain. As the technology has yet to make its way through all the necessary safety trials, S\u00f8rensen\u2019s bionic hand was removed after the experiment, making the restoration of touch a temporary joy.\n\n\u201cI was more than happy to volunteer for the clinical trial, not only for myself, but to help other amputees as well,\u201d says S\u00f8rensen, who must now content himself with his old prosthesis until the new one can be approved for public use.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "bionic hand, amputee, silvestro micera epfl, prosthetic technology", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new bionic hand lets amputee Dennis Aabo S\u00f8rensen feel the world for the first time since he lost his hand nearly a decade ago.", "title": "Bionic Hand Lets Amputee Feel The World Nine Years After His Accident [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/bionic-hand-lets-amputee-feel-world-real-time-after-nine-years-video-268686", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/05/bionic-hand.PNG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new bionic hand lets amputee Dennis Aabo S\u00f8rensen feel the world for the first time since he lost his hand nearly a decade ago.", "title": "Bionic Hand Lets Amputee Feel The World Nine Years After His Accident [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/bionic-hand-lets-amputee-feel-world-real-time-after-nine-years-video-268686", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/05/bionic-hand.PNG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/05/bionic-hand.PNG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-02-05T16:56:35-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-05T17:24:58-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new bionic hand lets amputee Dennis Aabo S\u00f8rensen feel the world for the first time since he lost his hand nearly a decade ago."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2175\"", "article_summary": "A new bionic hand lets amputee Dennis Aabo S\u00f8rensen feel the world for the first time since he lost his hand nearly a decade ago.\nAs the technology has yet to make its way through all the necessary safety trials, S\u00f8rensen\u2019s bionic hand was removed after the experiment, making the restoration of touch a temporary joy.\n\u201cThe sensory feedback was incredible,\u201d said S\u00f8rensen, who lost his left hand while handling fireworks back in 1995.\n\u201cI could feel things that I hadn\u2019t been able to feel in over nine years.\n\u00c9cole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) / YouTubeA series of groundbreaking developments in prosthetic technology have culminated in the successful trial of the world\u2019s first sensory-enhanced artificial limb \u2014 a \u201cbionic hand\u201d that allows the user to feel objects in real-time."}
