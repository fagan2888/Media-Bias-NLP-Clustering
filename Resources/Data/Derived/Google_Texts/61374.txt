Update: State Sen. Julie Denton has announced Monday afternoon that she’s running for Louisville Metro Council.

Earlier: Republican state Sen. Julie Denton of Louisville will not seek re-election next year, WFPL News has learned.

A spokesperson for Senate President Robert Stivers told the radio station Denton did not discuss her future plans, but informed Stivers this weekend she will not be filing to retain her east Louisville district seat in 2014.

The decision comes ahead of Denton making an “important announcement regarding both state and local government” at Metro Hall on Monday afternoon.

Denton has been in the Senate since 1995, and currently serves as chair of the Health and Welfare Committee.

During the legislative session earlier this year, she filed a bill to put implementation of Obamacare in hands of state lawmakers rather than the governor. Denton also sponsored legislation to have panels review allegations of abuse at nursing homes in order to crack down on frivolous lawsuits.

In 2010, Denton challenged former state Senate President David Williams in Republican leadership elections but dropped out before GOP lawmakers voted.

Several GOP sources have told WFPL Denton is planning to run for the Metro Council seat currently held by Republican Jerry Miller. Last month, Miller announced he running for a newly created state House seat in 2014.
