Four people were critically injured when a van and pickup truck collided Saturday night.

Troopers with the North Carolina Highway Patrol say it happened at the intersection of Highway 11 and Tyree Road around 9:15 p.m.

A van was traveling north on Highway 11 and a pickup truck was traveling west on Tyree Road when one of the vehicles ran a red stop light.

Troopers say it is unclear which vehicle ran the light and there were no witnesses to the accident.

There were two adults and four children in the van. Three of the children were not wearing seat belts. Two of the children were flown to Vidant Medical Center in critical condition.

The two adults in the van were also flown to Vidant in critical condition.

Troopers say the pickup truck driver did not go to the hospital Saturday, but did receive treatment at a hospital Sunday.

The driver of the van was cited for not having the children properly restrained. The accident remains under investigation.
