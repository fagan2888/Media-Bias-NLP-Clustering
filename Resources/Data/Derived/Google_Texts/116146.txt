Topics: Amy Schumer, ass, conan, team coco, Video, Entertainment News

Amy Schumer joined Conan Thursday night and said that the new season of “Inside Amy Schumer” will be entirely packaged around this year’s hot topic: ass.

“I think that this is the year of the ass,” the comic said, who went on to explain that the phenomenon can be traced back to Nicki Minaj’s “Anaconda” music video. “All of a sudden, after the Anaconda Nicki Minaj music video and Iggy Izealea, people are getting on board with the ass — and you know, black guys have always had our back and been into ass, but now white guys are like ‘maybe I like ass.'”

For those select white guys? Schumer says it’s too late.
