This time it read 45-23, but the Buffs' determined effort clearly bothered the Bruins as tempers flared in the fourth quarter.\n\nUCLA linebacker Kenny Orjioke, left, and UCLA linebacker Cameron Judge, right, cause Colorado returner Ryan Severson (30) to fumble on a kickoff return, which is recovered by UCLA in the first half Saturday in Pasadena. ( Alex Gallardo )\n\nThe Bruins, who were forced to keep their starters on the field for most of the game, were flagged twice on consecutive plays at one point for roughing Liufau as the remnants of a crowd of 80,337 booed and hissed.\n\n\"Our goal was to get to the second half with it being a football game,\" MacIntyre said. \"This was really the first time we've done that.\"\n\nThe Buffs lost for the 13th consecutive time in Pac-12 Conference action and the 21st straight time against a ranked team on the road. They are now 3-5 overall and 0-5 in the Pac-12 Conference with four games remaining in the season.\n\nThe Buffs must win three of the remaining four to reach their goal of bowl eligibility for the first time since 2007.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Liufau and his teammates turned in a gritty effort, they were forced to settle too often for field goal attempts instead of touchdowns.\n\n\"We've got to look at that and find a way to get those first downs down there,\" MacIntyre said.\n\nLiufau completed 25 of 36 passes for 247 yards and a touchdown. It was Liufau's first start on the road and his fourth career game. Since replacing Connor Wood in the lineup at Arizona State and committing three turnovers, Liufau has thrown just one interception in the past three games.\n\n\"I think our quarterback, the way he competes, the way he keeps fighting, the way he keeps standing in there, I think has given our whole team a lot of hope,\" MacIntyre said. \"I really do.\"\n\nRunning back Christian Powell rushed 22 times for 97 yards. True freshman running back Michael Adkins did not play because of a concussion he suffered last week.\n\nThe Buffs were able to move the ball from the start against a UCLA defense that had faced Stanford and Oregon the previous two weeks. Quarterback Sefo Liufau led an opening drive that stalled at the UCLA 28-yard line, but Will Oliver missed a 45-yard field goal attempt.\n\nThe Buffs put together another long drive on their third possession of the game and this time Oliver was able to give his team a 3-0 lead by making a 23-yard field goal.\n\nThe boo birds came out at the Rose Bowl when UCLA started the game with two punts and a loss of one yard on the first play of its third possession. But quarterback Brett Hundley dropped back and lofted a long pass to Devin Fuller on the next play and Fuller turned the boos into cheers with a 76-yard touchdown. He beat safety Jered Bell on the play.\n\nCU responded with a third sustained drive and managed to finally punch the ball into the end zone. After running back Tony Jones moved the ball inside the UCLA 10-yard line on a 38-yard catch, wide receiver Paul Richardson made an impressive grab along the sideline in the end zone with a defender draped on his back.\n\nIt was the eighth touchdown of the season for Richardson and his first score against the school he originally signed to play for out of high school. Richardson was able to play after nursing a sore ankle all week, but at times he didn't look like himself.\n\nColorado was trailing 14-10 in the second quarter when the game began to get away.\n\nKickoff return man Ryan Severson, who might have been still reeling from a hard hit on a previous return, fumbled and UCLA recovered at the CU 15.\n\nTwo plays later, Hundley hit Fuller for their second touchdown connection of the day. It covered six yards and the Bruins led 21-10. Fuller later scored a third touchdown on a lateral.\n\n\"It hurt,\" MacIntyre said. \"You can't be perfect, but we've got to be close to perfect right now. But you don't put pressure on the kids to be perfect.\"\n\nFor the second week in a row, the quarterback killed the Buffs by making plays when the original play broke down. Hundley completed 19 of 24 passes for 272 yards and the two touchdowns. He also led UCLA in rushing with 11 carries for 72 yards and two scores.\n\n\"I've got to do a better job of trying to get some way of getting a little bit more pressure on the quarterback without having to bring everybody,\" MacIntyre said. \"...We did get there a few times but he got away from us.\"\n\nContact staff writer Kyle Ringo at ringok@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/kyleringo.\n\nUCLA 45, Colorado 23\n\nColorado 3 10 0 10--23\n\nUCLA 7 14 14 10--45\n\nFirst Quarter\n\nCol -- FG Oliver 23, :56.\n\nUCLA -- Fuller 76 pass from Hundley (Fairbairn kick), :19.\n\nSecond Quarter\n\nCol -- Richardson 7 pass from Liufau (Oliver kick), 11:04.\n\nUCLA -- Hundley 11 run (Fairbairn kick), 7:49.\n\nUCLA -- Fuller 6 pass from Hundley (Fairbairn kick), 6:25.\n\nCol -- FG Oliver 47, 1:16.\n\nThird Quarter\n\nUCLA -- Hundley 1 run (Fairbairn kick), 10:53.\n\nUCLA -- Thigpen 5 run (Fairbairn kick), 1:24.\n\nFourth Quarter\n\nCol -- T.Jones 2 run (Oliver kick), 12:20.\n\nUCLA -- FG Fairbairn 45, 9:12.\n\nCol -- FG Oliver 37, 6:17.\n\nUCLA -- Fuller 8 run (Fairbairn kick), 3:36.\n\nA -- 80,377.\n\nCol UCLA\n\nFirst downs 26 18\n\nRushes-yards 40-134 33-139\n\nPassing 247 273\n\nComp-Att-Int 25-36-0 19-24-0\n\nReturn Yards 0 (-2)\n\nPunts-Avg. 2-35.0 3-43.7\n\nFumbles-Lost 2-1 0-0\n\nPenalties-Yards 6-40 11-122\n\nTime of Possession 35:59 24:01\n\nINDIVIDUAL STATISTICS\n\nRUSHING -- Colorado, Powell 22-97, T.Jones 7-15, Liufau 8-14, Abron 3-8.
