The Franklin High classes of 1978 and 1980 also are invited.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a unique group,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cFrom police officers and firefighters, to distinguished educators and doctors, to talented artists and renowned vocalists, our class has given so much back to this community. I\u2019m proud to know I have such a wonderful set of friends to come back to.\u201d\n\nThe reunion is at Homestead Manor, a restored antebellum home on Columbia Pike that is owned by Andy Marshall, a 1979 graduate and proprietor of Puckett\u2019s family of restaurants.\n\nThe event is from 7 to 11 p.m., and tickets are $40 at the door.
