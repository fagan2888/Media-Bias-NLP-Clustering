Asked a general question about the pope\u2019s impact on bishops, Cardinal Donald W. Wuerl, the archbishop of Washington, responded with a defense of the upscale hotel where the bishops were meeting, the Hyatt Regency New Orleans.\n\n\u201cWe have to meet at a hotel that\u2019s big enough to hold us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to meet at a hotel that\u2019s big enough to allow media to attend.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe shift in tone at the Vatican has been disquieting for some bishops. The archbishop of Indianapolis, Joseph W. Tobin, recently told a group of theologians, \u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen is how disruptive Pope Francis has been within the hierarchy of the United States,\u201d according to The National Catholic Reporter. \u201cI was talking to a couple of brother bishops a while back and they were saying that bishops and priests were very discouraged by Pope Francis because he was challenging them.\u201d\n\nBut the bishops are clearly watching with interest. \u201cPriests and bishops are paying close attention to what he\u2019s saying, and reading it,\u201d John Garvey, the president of the Catholic University of America, said in a telephone interview. Mr. Garvey said he was struck by how often church officials mentioned to him something the pope had only just said. \u201cI don\u2019t remember hearing that in the past about Benedict and John Paul.\u201d\n\nThe business of the bishops\u2019 meeting \u2014 presentations about clergy sexual abuse and assistance to victims of flooding in the Philippines, as well as about the church\u2019s battles against same-sex marriage and in favor of religious freedom \u2014 was planned months ago.\n\nBut on Thursday morning, the bishops also spent several hours discussing poverty and the relationship between marriage and economic well-being, both topics chosen to reflect the pope\u2019s priorities. Helen M. Alvar\u00e9, a law professor at George Mason University, told the bishops that the Francis papacy was \u201can inflection point in the life of the church.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe bishops\u2019 willingness to adapt their agenda to reflect that of Francis will most likely be tested next year, when they must decide how to update their quadrennial guide for Catholic voters. The American bishops, almost all of them appointed by Pope John Paul II or Pope Benedict, are a conservative group who have emphasized opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion in recent years and have been unable to reach a consensus on economic issues. On Wednesday, they began a discussion, which will continue through next year, about whether and how to incorporate the priorities of Francis in the 2016 version of the guide, which is called \u201cForming Consciences for Faithful Citizenship.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to keep talking about the hot-button issues that we\u2019ve been talking about for a long time, but not just those issues,\u201d Archbishop Gregory M. Aymond of New Orleans said in an interview. He added, \u201cWe don\u2019t, perhaps, at times talk enough about the poor, about the economy, and we don\u2019t perhaps talk enough about reaching out to those with disabilities, those whose voices are not heard.\u201d\n\nArchbishop Aymond said he has tried to address this in one small way himself, by returning phone calls and letters, and by reminding himself, \u201cpeople shouldn\u2019t always have to go through several others to get to us.\u201d\n\nArchbishop Joseph E. Kurtz of Louisville, Ky., the president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, told the gathering that, if the voters\u2019 guide is not revised, \u201cit will not include anything of the teachings of Pope Francis.\u201d And Bishop Robert W. McElroy, an auxiliary bishop in San Francisco, suggested that the document\u2019s discussion of evil, now focused on abortion and racism, should be revisited in light of the pope\u2019s description of economic inequality as a social evil.\n\nCardinal Daniel N. DiNardo of Houston, who has been leading the bishops\u2019 effort to consider reworking \u201cFaithful Citizenship,\u201d said the document would not shy away from the abortion issue, which he called \u201cvery important, crucial, significant, one of the chief issues\u201d and \u201cnonnegotiable.\u201d But, he said, to reflect Francis\u2019 agenda, the bishops would also \u201cwant to make sure we speak very insistently about the role of poverty, about the role of the economy.\u201d\n\nArchbishop Charles J. Chaput of Philadelphia is leading the bishops\u2019 most Francis-friendly effort \u2014 to persuade the pope to visit that city next year, when a large gathering of Catholic families is planned there. Archbishop Chaput said he already had \u201cgood reasons to believe\u201d the pope would come to the event. But just in case, the entire bishops\u2019 conference agreed to send a letter to Francis, inviting him to attend, and, in the process, to make what would be his first trip to the United States as pope.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140612210052, "twitter": {"description": "Fifteen months into the pontificate of Pope Francis, the Roman Catholic bishops of the United States find themselves unsettled in ways large and small.", "creator": "MichaelPaulson", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/13/us/us-bishops-seek-to-match-vatican-in-shifting-tone.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002936366"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "title": "U.S. Bishops Seek to Match Vatican in Shifting Tone", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/13/us/JP-BISHOPS1/JP-BISHOPS1-thumbLarge-v3.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/13/us/us-bishops-seek-to-match-vatican-in-shifting-tone.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002936366", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/13/us/us-bishops-seek-to-match-vatican-in-shifting-tone.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "June 12, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/michael_paulson/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2014-06-13", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Francis", "published": "2014-06-12", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "keywords": "Priests,United States Conference of Catholic Bishops,Roman Catholic Church,Francis", "description": "Fifteen months into the pontificate of Pope Francis, the Roman Catholic bishops of the United States find themselves unsettled in ways large and small.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Michael Paulson", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/13/us/JP-BISHOPS1/JP-BISHOPS1-thumbLarge-v3.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Francis", "slug": "13bishops", "byl": "By MICHAEL PAULSON", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Fifteen months into the pontificate of Pope Francis, the Roman Catholic bishops of the United States find themselves unsettled in ways large and small.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/13/us/JP-BISHOPS1/JP-BISHOPS1-thumbStandard-v3.jpg", "news_keywords": "Priest,Pope Francis", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "June 12, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "org": "Roman Catholic Church", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140613135017, "hdl_p": "U.S. Bishops Seek to Match Vatican in Shifting Tone", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/13/us/us-bishops-seek-to-match-vatican-in-shifting-tone.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/13/us/JP-BISHOPS1/JP-BISHOPS1-videoSixteenByNine1050-v3.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Fifteen months into the pontificate of Pope Francis, the Roman Catholic bishops of the United States find themselves unsettled in ways large and small.", "title": "U.S. Bishops Seek to Match Vatican in Shifting Tone"}, "pdate": 20140612, "des": "Priests", "articleid": 100000002936366, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "U.S. Bishops Seek to Match Vatican in Shifting Tone", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb968\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI was talking to a couple of brother bishops a while back and they were saying that bishops and priests were very discouraged by Pope Francis because he was challenging them.\u201dBut the bishops are clearly watching with interest.\n\u201cWe have to meet at a hotel that\u2019s big enough to allow media to attend.\u201dPhotoThe shift in tone at the Vatican has been disquieting for some bishops.\nAsked a general question about the pope\u2019s impact on bishops, Cardinal Donald W.
