LANDER, Wyo. (AP) â€” A Wyoming man has pleaded guilty in the shootings of two American Indian men in a case that exposed racial tensions in a reservation border town.

Thirty-two-year-old Roy Clyde pleaded guilty Thursday. He faces life in prison under a plea agreement that spares him the death penalty.

Clyde is a former parks worker for the city of Riverton, on the border of the Wind River Indian Reservation.

Clyde said he shot and killed 29-year-old Stallone Trosper and critically wounded 50-year-old James "Sonny" Goggles at a Riverton detox center in July.

Trosper and Goggles are members of the Northern Arapaho Tribe.

Clyde said he was targeting transients who frequented city parks, regardless of race.

But the victims' relatives said after the hearing they believe Clyde targeted American Indians.
