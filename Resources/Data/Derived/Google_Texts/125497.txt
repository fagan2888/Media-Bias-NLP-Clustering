DENVER (AP) — Colorado’s Public Utility Commission has ruled that no changes are needed to the state’s net metering process and that homeowners with solar installations will continue to receive retail rates for energy they produce.

Net metering provides a credit for every kilowatt-hour an array puts on the grid at the same price residential customers are charged for electricity.

According to the Boulder Daily Camera (http://tinyurl.com/qe4d6pp ), Xcel Energy has been pushing a plan to cut the incentives for each kilowatt-hour produced to a fraction of a penny.

Solar users and industry groups have lobbied hard against changes that they say would remove a key financial incentive to solar installations.
