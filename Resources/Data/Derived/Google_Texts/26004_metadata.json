U.S. Government\n\nAn endowment gift from a tycoon suffering an obscure disease or condition may sound less like a ringing endorsement of promising research and more like a bequest in the name of wishful thinking. However, Las Vegas casino magnate Steve Wynn sounds positively persuasive in his praise for stem cell researchers at the University of Iowa, to whom he gave a substantial sum to find a cure for a degenerative form of blindness he happens to have.\n\nOn Friday, the 71 year old gave $25 million to the university to help fund work to cure blindness caused by retinitis pigmentosa, among other conditions. Wynn was first diagnosed with the rare eye defect nearly half a century ago, when no hope existed for sufferers. Slowly, Wynn\u2019s eyesight has weakened with nighttime blindness and lack of peripheral vision.\n\nBut he believes researchers at the university may find a cure within his lifetime, using stem cells taken from his own body for testing in laboratory mice.\n\n\"This is an exhilarating, quite exciting place. To a scientist, this is like going to a rock concert,\" Wynn, the chairman of Wynn Resorts Ltd., told The Associated Press. \"I mean there is stuff going on in these rooms here that, to put it in the common vernacular, is really far out.\"\n\nWynn spoke with reporters following an event at the university to rededicate the \u201cStephen A. Wynn Institute for Vision Research\u201d following the monetary gift in August. The university plans to build a new laboratory to grow stem cells, hire more researchers, and further investigations already underway.\n\nWynn also praised researchers by saying his business accomplishments in Las Vegas paled by comparison to the important stem cell research being conducted at the university. \"The rest of the world is waiting with bated breath for the kind of work you're doing,\" he said. \"To help keep the lights on in this institute has now become synonymous with keeping the lights on in people's eyes.\"\n\nWynn, whose name is borne by numerous casinos and hotels around the world, said the university asked to use his name for the research institute, a la Trump style, to gussy up donations from competitive alumni and business magnates with ties to the state. The tycoon also said the donation was meant to help others, and that he\u2019d been \u201cblessed\u201d with a slow progression of the disease.\n\nStill, he marveled at the scientific accomplishments of the day. \u201cThey\u2019ve got my cells in mice!\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s 100 mice here that had my retinal cells and they are running around.\u201d Someday, Wynn may be one of the first patients to receive replacement photoreceptor cells in an effort to restore vision lost to the disease.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "retinitus pigmentosa, degenerative blindness, loss of peripheral vision, steve wynn, university of iowa stem cell research", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "His name borne by numerous casinos and hotels around the world, Las Vegas magnate Steve Wynn has given $25 million to the University of Iowa in a bid to cure blindness from retinitus pigmentosa.", "title": "Casino Tycoon Steve Wynn Underwites Cure For Degenerative Blindness With $25 Million Gift", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/casino-tycoon-steve-wynn-underwites-cure-degenerative-blindness-25-million-gift-260413", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/20/stem-cell-research-may-cure-retinal-pigmentitis.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "His name borne by numerous casinos and hotels around the world, Las Vegas magnate Steve Wynn has given $25 million to the University of Iowa in a bid to cure blindness from retinitus pigmentosa.", "title": "Casino Tycoon Steve Wynn Underwites Cure For Degenerative Blindness With $25 Million Gift", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/casino-tycoon-steve-wynn-underwites-cure-degenerative-blindness-25-million-gift-260413", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/20/stem-cell-research-may-cure-retinal-pigmentitis.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/20/stem-cell-research-may-cure-retinal-pigmentitis.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2013-10-20T19:22:22-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-20T19:22:21-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "His name borne by numerous casinos and hotels around the world, Las Vegas magnate Steve Wynn has given $25 million to the University of Iowa in a bid to cure blindness from retinitus pigmentosa."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9af0\"", "article_summary": "Wynn spoke with reporters following an event at the university to rededicate the \u201cStephen A.
