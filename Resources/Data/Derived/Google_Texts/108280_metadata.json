Now, he\u2019s sitting in a restaurant at Cannes riding the sensation of \u201cDope,\u201d his comic Los Angeles coming-of-age tale that sparked a bidding war this year at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty freaking awesome,\u201d Famuyiwa says, tipping back his white fedora. \u201cHere we are less than a year later. It\u2019s been crazy from Sundance to here. I haven\u2019t quite gotten any perspective on it yet, but I\u2019m enjoying the moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cDope\u201d premiered Friday in the Cannes Film Festival\u2019s Directors\u2019 Fortnight section with most of its young cast enthusiastically in tow. It\u2019s a large group, including star newcomer Shameik Moore, Zoe Kravitz, ASAP Rocky, Tony Revolori and others. While many indies that make it to Cannes arrive with a small retinue, \u201cDope\u201d is here in full force \u2014 and some cast members even paid their own way to come.\n\n\u201cDope\u201d is a buoyant, stereotype-busting high-school movie about a geek (Moore) in Inglewood, California, who\u2019s aiming to get into Harvard but is thrust into a rollicking adventure when drug dealers looking for a hiding place stuff his backpack full of Ecstasy.\n\nThe close bond between the cast comes partly out of the unlikeliness of their journey. \u201cDope\u201d was made last summer in a rapid 24-day shoot around Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cWe were making something we all believe in,\u201d says Famuyiwa.\n\nBut at first, it was difficult to find backers who also believed in it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sensation of \u2018Dope\u2019 continues at Cannes Film Festival", "title": "Sensation of \u2018Dope\u2019 continues at Cannes Film Festival", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Sensation of \u2018Dope\u2019 continues at Cannes Film Festival", "title": "Sensation of \u2018Dope\u2019 continues at Cannes Film Festival", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/23/sensation_of_dope_continues_at_cannes_film_festival/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/france-cannes-dope-photo-call.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sensation of \u2018Dope\u2019 continues at Cannes Film Festival", "title": "Sensation of \u2018Dope\u2019 continues at Cannes Film Festival", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/france-cannes-dope-photo-call.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jake Coyle", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Now, he\u2019s sitting in a restaurant at Cannes riding the sensation of \u201cDope,\u201d his comic Los Angeles coming-of-age tale that sparked a bidding war this year at the Sundance Film Festival.\nIt\u2019s a large group, including star newcomer Shameik Moore, Zoe Kravitz, ASAP Rocky, Tony Revolori and others.\nI haven\u2019t quite gotten any perspective on it yet, but I\u2019m enjoying the moment.\u201d\u201cDope\u201d premiered Friday in the Cannes Film Festival\u2019s Directors\u2019 Fortnight section with most of its young cast enthusiastically in tow.\nWhile many indies that make it to Cannes arrive with a small retinue, \u201cDope\u201d is here in full force \u2014 and some cast members even paid their own way to come.\n\u201cDope\u201d was made last summer in a rapid 24-day shoot around Los Angeles."}
