Conservatives have long argued that “first dollar” insurance coverage helps raise the cost of health care, as people tend to overconsume services they perceive as free. Implementation of state insurance exchanges appears to confirm that hypothesis: Several states that used “free” federal dollars to build complicated exchanges may end up scrapping them.

Would Massachusetts officials still have wanted to create “the absolute Rolls-Royce of any health exchange” had they been required to pay its costs—which could approach nearly $300 million? Would the Bay State have chosen to redesign the state portal while also exploring a backup move to the federal exchange had federal dollars not been funding its Plan B and Plan C?

In Oregon, would officials have tried to re-create the “entire” computer infrastructure of the state Department of Human Services had such efforts come out of the state social services department’s budget?

It is, of course, impossible to answer these questions definitively. But state officials almost certainly would not have been stingier with federal dollars than with their own funds. And constraining their ambitions might have produced more functional exchanges.
