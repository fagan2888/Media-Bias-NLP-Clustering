Let\u2019s do the time warp again, indeed.\n\nWe\u2019re talking about the partial government shutdown, which lasted 16 days, and the U.S. debt limit deadline, which came the possibility of a default, which came perilously close to happening.\n\nIf nations can breathe, this one breathed an immense sigh of relief\u2014but with teeth gritted, as angry as Peter Finch in the film, \u201cNetwork\u201d: \"I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore.\"\n\nTake a look at House Speaker John Boehner, pumping his fist and then explaining things to his constituents in Cincinnati: \u201cWe fought the good fight. We just didn\u2019t win.\u201d Or as another die-hard Republican Tea Party type said: \u201c We tried. We lost.\u201d\n\nThen, let\u2019s listen to Republican freshman Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who grandly said he would not try to stop the last-minute deal between Senate Democrats and Republicans from going forward and being passed on to the House where Boehner passed it lickety split, to beat the midnight deadline for default by at least some 66 minutes.\n\nIs it just me, or does everybody think he had the votes all along?\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for culprits for this shutdown, start with Cruz, who fabulously managed to convince some of his GOP peers in the Senate and especially the Tea Party stalwarts in the House\u2014who have to date accomplished exactly nothing in terms of meaningful legislation, new ideas, stuff like that\u2014that they could indeed win a battle to defund Obamacare, otherwise known as the Affordable Care Act, by threatening a government shutdown. Cruz lobbied, niggled and nagged. With a futile and weird filibuster, filled with references to Doctor Seuss among other things, he pushed his conservative allies to hold their ground.\n\nSure as shooting, despite every attempt by the GOP to seem conciliatory by sending over a flurry of bills, the administration and the Democrats stood their ground and refused to consider anything but a \u201cclean\u201d bill, minus anti-Obama care stipulations. As Obama put it grandly: \u201cWe will not let the United States government be held hostage.\u201d Sure as shooting, the government shut down.\n\nIt has been a remarkable journey for Boehner, who had months ago refused to consider doing what he ended up doing, saying that Obamacare was the law and \"We lost the election.\" At the first sign of what the most conservative parts of the House were up to, he caved and joined them. Then, he said he would not allow the country to go into default. All along, he said complained that the president and Harry Reid refused to negotiate. Then, he said he didn\u2019t have the votes to pass a House bill . Savvy insiders said that there were at least 22 or so GOP members willing to pass a clean bill Turns out, there were actually 87. Can you believe it?\n\nIt was about this time that Boehner said, \u201cWe fought the good fight. We just didn\u2019t win.\u201d On the same day, Rep. Mike Mulvaney, R-S.C., added: \u201cWe tried. We lost.\u201d\n\nNote to Mr. Boehner and Mr. Mulvaney: you didn\u2019t lose.\n\nWe lost. We, the American people, Mr. Cruz, whom you kept quoting as if you were sleeping with us late at night when we gave up our secrets, we, the United States, lost\u2014about 24 billion dollars, millions of hours of manpower, time and effort spent in crisis, worry, fear and misery, caused by you and your cohorts in the House.\n\nI do recall both Cruz and the ladies on television shopping in Culpepper, Va., who insisted that \u201cin order to get what you want, you have to make a sacrifice.\u201d\n\nCruz, the GOP and the Tea Party conducted this foolhardy campaign to shut down Obomacare by any means necessary with an attitude that\u2014to twist a phrase the greatest Republican who ever lived said\u2014\u201cwas full of malice toward many and charity for none.\u201d It was especially so for those thousands of government workers who were furloughed, tourists visiting the capital and the country\u2019s national parks and museums, the City of Washington, which took a monumental hit, and the faith of Americans in government.\n\nWere the president and the Democrats to blame, also? Sure: they too spent time in strategizing, figuring out what to spin, whom to pressure, where they could make political points and gains, all useless tasks that did nothing to alleviate a single American\u2019s pain.\n\nVeterans and truckers somehow combined for an Oct. 13 protest at the World War II Memorial, a place used by GOP politicians to grandstand and wrap themselves in the flag and pose with members of the Greatest Generation, making real again the old saying that \u201cPatriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.\u201d\n\nHow else can one explain Cruz, who asked who could do such a thing as keeping veterans from visiting the WWII memorial. Actually, nobody, since no vet was denied access. But, to answer the question, why you could, Senator. Cruz, arguably the biggest game player in Washington, called for an end to game playing.\n\nThis is not a victory for anyone. Nobody won; nobody lost. This was a debacle, even as Tea Party legislators compared themselves to Gandhi\u2014and, would you believe it, William Wallace, the Scottish patriot, glorified in the film, \u201cBraveheart,\u201d by Mel Gibson? Wallace, although dying very slowly and nobly in the movie, suffered drawing and quartering. The Tea Party, acting like Mel Gibson on a bad night, lost a head count. It was the American people who were drawn and quartered.", "article_metadata": {"google-site-verification": "ugP87rLrMjrBYBz9rCcVsjWtHPbxwO_sPTuJFJaAP8M"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfb1a\"", "article_summary": "The Tea Party, acting like Mel Gibson on a bad night, lost a head count.\nWe just didn\u2019t win.\u201d Or as another die-hard Republican Tea Party type said: \u201c We tried.\nWe just didn\u2019t win.\u201d On the same day, Rep.
