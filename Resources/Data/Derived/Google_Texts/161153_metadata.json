It\u2019s a metal tower. So, I think that was one little draw back that they\u2019re considering,\" said Arthur. \"It\u2019s a classy ride that will look good in the skyline. It\u2019s not a cheap carnival ride.\"\n\nThe total investment to get the ride up and operating would be around $2.5 million.\n\n\"It could also turn into something that people could reference...'Hey, meet me by the big swirly glowing thing up there,'\" said Oklahoma City resident Rick Thompson.\n\n\"I\u2019d come down all the time, like every day,\" Rick\u2019s daughter, Taylor Thompson, said.\n\nArthur still has a long way to go, but he's pushing to get the \"Bricktown Flyer\" up and running by next spring.\n\nWe\u2019ll keep you posted.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "New details surrounding a 220-foot amusement ride that may go up in the middle of Bricktown.", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/25981881/bricktown-design-committee-looks-at-plans-for-the-bricktown-flyer", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/4169829_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "New details surrounding a 220-foot amusement ride that may go up in the middle of Bricktown.", "title": "Bricktown Design Committee Looks At Plans For The 'Bricktown Flyer'"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/4169829_G.jpg", "description": "New details surrounding a 220-foot amusement ride that may go up in the middle of Bricktown.", "card": "summary", "title": "Bricktown Design Committee Looks At Plans For The 'Bricktown Flyer'"}, "wnreadableurl": "bricktown-design-committee-looks-at-plans-for-the-bricktown-flyer", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2014/07/09", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news, bricktown, flyer, amusement, ride, design, committee, news 9, news9.com, kwtv", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS19", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news, bricktown, flyer, amusement, ride, design, committee, news 9, news9.com, kwtv"}, "article_summary": "It's an idea making its way through the Bricktown Urban Design Committee.\nAt the northwest corner of Mickey Mantel and Reno, across from Bricktown Ballpark, is where Brandon wants to build the \"Bricktown Flyer,\" but he said some Bricktown Design Committee members are worried the ride won't fit in the district.\nAt 220 feet in the air, 12 passenger vehicles will seat two people each, giving riders an unsurpassed view of downtown Oklahoma City.\nArthur still has a long way to go, but he's pushing to get the \"Bricktown Flyer\" up and running by next spring.\nNew details surrounding a 220-foot amusement ride that may go up in the middle of Bricktown."}
