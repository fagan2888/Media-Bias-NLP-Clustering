Although Obama has long joked about so-called \u201cBirthers\u201d who have continued to demand the first African-American president produce his birth certificate, on his recent trip to Africa, the president added a new joke to his repertoire \u2014 predicting that he could win a third term.\n\n\u201cI actually think I\u2019m a pretty good president \u2014 I think if I ran, I could win\u201d Obama joked during his speech to the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia before quickly adding, \u201cbut I can\u2019t!\u201d:\n\n\n\nRather than threatening American conservatives with what may be their worst nightmare, Obama was actually lecturing African leaders who fail to respect constitutionally set term limits. Obama pointed to violence that erupted in the African nation of Burundi after that president unconstitutionally secured a third term.\n\n\u201cNow, let me be honest with you,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI do not understand this. I am in my second term. It has been an extraordinary privilege for me to serve as the President of the United States. I cannot imagine a greater honor or a more interesting job. I love my work. But under our Constitution, I cannot run again.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama argued that part of the reason why former South African president Nelson Mandela \u201cforged a lasting legacy\u201d is because he was \u201cwilling to leave office and transfer power peacefully.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama also spoke about a host of other issues that plague authoritarian regimes in the region. In Ethiopia, where the African Union is seated, journalist and critics of the government are routinely imprisoned. Ahead of Obama\u2019s visit, the first ever for a sitting U.S. president, Ethiopia released five journalists who had been jailed for over a year on terrorism-related charges.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Spoiler alert: Obama isn't actually seeking to circumvent the Constitution VIDEO", "title": "Conservatives\u2019 worst nightmare: Obama predicts he\u2019d win if he sought third term", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Spoiler alert: Obama isn't actually seeking to circumvent the Constitution VIDEO", "title": "Conservatives\u2019 worst nightmare: Obama predicts he\u2019d win if he sought third term", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/28/conservatives_worst_nightmare_obama_predicts_hed_win_if_he_sought_third_term/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/barack_obama18.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Spoiler alert: Obama isn't actually seeking to circumvent the Constitution VIDEO", "title": "Conservatives\u2019 worst nightmare: Obama predicts he\u2019d win if he sought third term", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/barack_obama18.jpg", "creator": "@@SophiaTesfaye", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sophia Tesfaye", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, GOP, President Obama, Republicans, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: 2016 Elections, GOP, President Obama, Republicans, Video, News, Politics NewsIn the minds of many conservatives, President Obama is a lawless Manchurian candidate, born in Kenya and who illegitimately holds the highest office in the land.\nAhead of Obama\u2019s visit, the first ever for a sitting U.S. president, Ethiopia released five journalists who had been jailed for over a year on terrorism-related charges.\nIn Ethiopia, where the African Union is seated, journalist and critics of the government are routinely imprisoned.\nObama pointed to violence that erupted in the African nation of Burundi after that president unconstitutionally secured a third term.\nIt has been an extraordinary privilege for me to serve as the President of the United States."}
