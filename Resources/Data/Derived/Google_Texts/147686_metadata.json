She had minimal loan debt and believes she was smart about getting an MBA, along with her law degree, which likely helped her position in the job market.\n\nKwesi Atta-Krah, 32, of Urbandale, said starting UI law school this year may be a risk, but he considered it for many years after watching his wife graduate from Drake Law School and is now working as a lawyer. He also got advice from family members, who are lawyers, and other lawyers about the profession.\n\nWestercamp, Atta-Krah and other UI law graduates were concerned about the small incoming class size of 94 this fall. But they were relieved to see the standards were not lowered just to increase numbers and tuition.\n\nAtta-Krah, who came to America in 2000 from Ghana, said his situation may be better, or at least different, from other first-year law students because he received his bachelor\u0092s from UI and had worked for the past nine years as an auditor at Wells Fargo in West Des Moines before starting school again this fall.\n\n\u0093I\u0092ve been able to work and save some money, so I feel fortunate to not have the debt when I finish,\u0094 he said.\n\n\u0093I think it\u0092s also important to think about how each school is different and where you want to practice. Iowa (law school) is a great opportunity. I think I will be able to find a job where I want to practice \u0097 in Des Moines.\"\n\nWestercamp emphasized how important work experience is while in law school. She was a teaching assistant and had a summer position with Jones Day in 2008.\n\nShe then clerked for U.S. District Judge John Jarvey for two years before joining Jones Day full-time in 2011.\n\n\u0093I guess I was insulated from what was going on because I clerked for two years, but the job crunch was starting to hit in 2009,\u0094 Westercamp said. \u0093I already had the job offer from Jones Day, but there were others who were offered jobs and then the law firms rescinded the offer.\u0094\n\nShe took advantage of the job fairs on campus, but she also put in the time and work to find her dream job in New York. Westercamp said the experience she had with Judge Jarvey was invaluable and helped her prepare for her associate position.\n\nJustin Grad, 31, an associate with Latham and Watkins in Costa Mesa, Calif., and a 2009 UI graduate, said he also had friends who had offers rescinded when the fallout hit the job market.\n\n\u0093The dynamics of the industry have changed, but I think there will always be a need for talented attorneys,\u0094 Grad said. \u0093Of course, debt load has to be a consideration. I had some substantial loans.\u0094\n\nTony Eves, 32, a 2012 graduate, didn\u0092t end up as a lawyer, but his law degree helped him get into a career about which he\u0092s passionate \u0097 he's in a management training program with Kaiser Permanente, a not-for-profit integrated health plan company in San Diego, Calif.\n\n\u0093I always wanted to be a lawyer . My dad is a judge (in Utah), but when the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010 that became my passion,\" he recalled.\n\n\"I became interested in health care policy, and this was chance to be on the ground floor. It came down to, did I want to be litigating or on the front line of health care decisions?\u0094\n\nEves said a law degree \u0097 even if someone doesn\u0092t end up practicing law \u0097 can open many doors and lead to other careers.\n\nAtta-Krah said that\u0092s why he didn\u0092t hesitate about law school.\n\n\u0093I came here to learn and get an education,\u0094 Atta-Krah said. \u0093The law is a complex area, where you learn a variety of things that could be the basis for so many things, but I would feel fortunate to be part of profession where these people (lawyers) want to help others.\n\n\"I would feel privileged to be part of that.\"", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | Attorney Kara Westercamp, who graduated from the University of Iowa College of Law in 2009, said there\u0092s no guarantee in the law job market.\u0093Do the math, and as", "og": {"url": "http://www.thegazette.com/2013/10/12/university-of-iowa-law-grads-say-career-still-worth-pursuing", "site_name": "The Gazette", "image": "http://www.thegazette.com/storyimage/GA/20131012/NEWS/310129993/AR/0/AR-310129993.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Attorney Kara Westercamp, who graduated from the University of Iowa College of Law in 2009, said there\u0092s no guarantee in the law job market."}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thegazette.com/2013/10/12/university-of-iowa-law-grads-say-career-still-worth-pursuing", "description": "Attorney Kara Westercamp, who graduated from the University of Iowa College of Law in 2009, said there\u0092s no guarantee in the law job market.", "site": "@gazettedotcom", "title": "University of Iowa law grads say career still worth pursuing"}, "fb": {"app_id": 163646090334606}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "bt": {"modDate": "2014-03-28T21:44:00-05:00", "type": "thegazette_", "pubDate": "2013-10-12T06:59:00-05:00", "title": "University of Iowa law grads say career still worth pursuing"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-touch-fullscreen": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Attorney Kara Westercamp, who graduated from the University of Iowa College of Law in 2009, said there\u0092s no guarantee in the law job market.\nWestercamp, Atta-Krah and other UI law graduates were concerned about the small incoming class size of 94 this fall.\nIowa (law school) is a great opportunity.\nShe then clerked for U.S. District Judge John Jarvey for two years before joining Jones Day full-time in 2011.\nKwesi Atta-Krah, 32, of Urbandale, said starting UI law school this year may be a risk, but he considered it for many years after watching his wife graduate from Drake Law School and is now working as a lawyer."}
