(AP) \u2014 A federal judge on Friday threw out an Obama administration decision to remove gray wolves in the western Great Lakes region from the endangered species list \u2014 a decision that will ban further wolf hunting and trapping in three states.\n\nThe order affects wolves in Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin, where the combined population is estimated at around 3,700. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service dropped federal protections from those wolves in 2012 and handed over management to the states.\n\nU.S. District Judge Beryl Howell in Washington, D.C., ruled Friday the removal was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d and violated the federal Endangered Species Act.\n\nUnless overturned, her decision will block the states from scheduling additional hunting and trapping seasons for the predators. All three have had at least one hunting season since protections were lifted, while Minnesota and Wisconsin also have allowed trapping. More than 1,500 Great Lakes wolves have been killed, said Jonathan Lovvorn, senior vice president of the Humane Society of the United States, one of several groups whose lawsuit prompted Howell\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased that the court has recognized that the basis for the delisting decision was flawed, and would stop wolf recovery in its tracks,\u201d Lovvorn said.\n\nFish and Wildlife Service spokesman Gavin Shire said the agency was disappointed and would confer with the U.S. Department of Justice and the states about whether to appeal.\n\n\u201cThe science clearly shows that wolves are recovered in the Great Lakes region, and we believe the Great Lakes states have clearly demonstrated their ability to effectively manage their wolf populations,\u201d Shire said. \u201cThis is a significant step backward.\u201d\n\nState officials acknowledged being caught by surprise and said they would study the judge\u2019s 111-page opinion before deciding what to do next.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unusual turn of events,\u201d said Tom Landwehr, Minnesota\u2019s natural resources commissioner.\n\nThe ruling is the latest twist in more than a decade of court battles over the gray wolf, which has made a strong recovery after being shot, poisoned and trapped into near-extermination in the lower 48 states in the last century. Only a remnant pocket in northern Minnesota remained when the species was added to the federal endangered list in 1974.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some gray wolves to be returned to endangered list", "author": "John Flesher", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Some gray wolves to be returned to endangered list", "title": "Some gray wolves to be returned to endangered list", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/20/some_gray_wolves_to_be_returned_to_endangered_list/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/wolves-great-lakes.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some gray wolves to be returned to endangered list", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/wolves-great-lakes.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Some gray wolves to be returned to endangered list", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Some gray wolves to be returned to endangered list", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf6fc\"", "article_summary": "Only a remnant pocket in northern Minnesota remained when the species was added to the federal endangered list in 1974.\n\u201cThe science clearly shows that wolves are recovered in the Great Lakes region, and we believe the Great Lakes states have clearly demonstrated their ability to effectively manage their wolf populations,\u201d Shire said.\nThe order affects wolves in Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin, where the combined population is estimated at around 3,700.\nU.S. District Judge Beryl Howell in Washington, D.C., ruled Friday the removal was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d and violated the federal Endangered Species Act.\nFish and Wildlife Service dropped federal protections from those wolves in 2012 and handed over management to the states."}
