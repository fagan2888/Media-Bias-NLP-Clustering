The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene cut its projected revenue by $4.1 million for the coming fiscal year, reflecting a decrease in fines amid an overhaul of the city's restaurant grading system.

The city health agency is projecting revenue of $30 million from the fines in fiscal 2015, down from the $34.1 million expected by the close of fiscal 2014, which ends June 30.

Mary Bassett, the city's health commissioner, said Tuesday that Mayor Bill de Blasio's executive budget "reflects substantial reductions in expected revenue from fines."

"Restaurants are doing better on their inspections," Dr. Bassett said at a City Council budget hearing.

The decrease in revenue comes amid a push by Mr. de Blasio and the City Council to reduce fines by 25% while increasing the number of inspections. The grading system, which began in 2010 under then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg, assigns restaurants a grade, generally A, B or "grade pending."

During his campaign for mayor last year, Mr. de Blasio promised to lower the fines, which some restaurant owners and industry advocates have said are unfair and too costly.

The drop in projected revenue from the restaurant grading program includes a 15% reduction in the dollar amount of fines incurred by restaurants that receive health violations, officials said.

The overhaul will also offer "consultative, penalty-free inspections" to restaurants that request them in addition to official inspections. The final rules on the new system are expected to be released by the agency next week, officials said.

The amount of money in fines collected by the city's health department was $40.4 million in fiscal 2013, down from its peak of $52 million in fiscal 2012.
