Back in January, General Motors (NYSE:GM) took the wraps off of its stunning 2015 Cadillac ATS Coupe at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit.

We -- the Motley Fool's John Rosevear and Rex Moore -- were there when it happened. We've brought you reports on this new model, and on its importance to Cadillac -- but there's more to the story.



While we were at the event, we had the chance to talk with GM Senior Vice President Bob Ferguson about the importance of the ATS to GM's effort to make Cadillac into a leading global luxury-car brand. Ferguson knows as much about that effort as anyone: Not only does he run the Cadillac brand, but as a member of GM's Executive Committee, he's part of the group that has set GM's overall strategic direction for the next several years.

We know that the transformation of the Cadillac brand is a key part of GM's global strategy, and we know that it's a major effort that will take several more years to fully unfold. But the 2012 introduction of the Cadillac ATS was a key milestone in GM's plan: For the first time ever, GM has a car that can compete head-to-head with what many consider to be one of the finest cars in the world: BMW's (NASDAQOTH:BAMXF) all-conquering 3-Series.

The ATS Sedan has proven to be a very strong entry in the compact luxury sedan segment, and we expect the new ATS Coupe to build on the sedan's success. In this video, shot right on the show floor immediately after the ATS Coupe was unveiled, you'll hear Ferguson talk about why the ATS is so important to GM's plans for Cadillac -- and about how GM is moving to expand the brand's reach around the world.
