Suspicion gradually centered on Jofi Joseph, the point man on nuclear nonproliferation at the National Security Council. So at a meeting in which everyone was in on the scam an inaccurate but innocuous news tidbit was revealed. When Joseph used his anonymous Twitter handle #natlsecwonk to broadcast the tidbit he was caught and promptly fired. He was not fired for revealing any secrets, but for making disparaging comments about thin-skinned administration players ranging from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel.\n\nWhat apparently intensified the campaign to identify the \u201csnarker\u201d was a comment about Valerie Jarrett, the senior Obama adviser who has her own Secret Service detail and appears to exercise an inordinate amount of power behind the scenes.

He writes that what \u201chas remained consistent about the Obama administration is that vacuity \u2014 the slow response in a crisis, the hesitant and contradictory communication, a lack of conviction and engagement amid constant political calculation.\u201d The stunning revelation that President Obama wasn\u2019t kept properly apprised of problems with Obamacare\u2019s website is just the latest example of how dysfunctional Obama World can be.\n\nWhether Jarrett\u2019s influence is all too real or exaggerated is unknowable.
