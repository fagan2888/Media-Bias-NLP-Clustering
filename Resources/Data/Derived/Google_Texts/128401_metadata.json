The campaigns pounded each other in television ads and campaign mailers that flooded district voters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m relieved, because it is over,\u201d Gonzalez said Tuesday night from his victory party at Ophelia\u2019s Pasta House in Nokomis. \u201cMy family doesn\u2019t have to go through all of this anymore.\u201d\n\nWith no major party opposition in November, Gonzalez is expected to easily defeat a pair of write-in candidates on the ballot and replace state Rep. Doug Holder, R-Osprey, who is in his final term.\n\nGonzalez, 50, campaigned as a conservative Republican who will fight the implementation Common Core education standards, opposes expanding Medicaid in Florida under the Affordable Care Act and would have opposed allowing undocumented immigrants who graduate from Florida high schools to get in-state college tuition rates.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be a representative that is there to honestly try to solve the problems and address the needs of the district to the best of my abilities,\u201d said Gonzalez, an orthopedic surgeon who has lived in Venice for 10 years.\n\nThe two candidates combined to spend more than $660,000 in their battle to win a two-year term that pays just over $30,000 a year. In addition, political groups poured in at least another $900,000, for a combined $1.5 million used primarily on attacking ads on TV, in mailers and on the Internet.\n\nGonzalez had to overcome attacks by DeNapoli about why Gonzalez gave a $500 donation to U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat. Gonzalez said the donations were part of an effort to help get a meeting with Wasserman Schultz and influence her on medical issues. Gonzalez said it didn\u2019t work. Instead the meeting went so badly, it partly inspired him to run for office.\n\nDuring the campaign, Gonzalez repeatedly stressed that DeNapoli, who moved to Sarasota County in 2013, didn\u2019t know the area well enough to represent it in Tallahassse.\n\nGonzalez said he believes DeNapoli\u2019s short-time residency played a big role in the race.\n\n\u201cI think it is important that people select people to represent them from their communities,\u201d Gonzalez said.\n\nGonzalez benefitted from a strong endorsement from U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Miami Republican, down the stretch. Rubio made television ads that blanketed Sarasota in an effort to help Gonzalez.\n\n\u201cI am forever indebted to him,\u201d Gonzalez said.\n\nDeNapoli, who called Gonzalez to concede and endorse him, said he had no regrets. He said he didn\u2019t have the money to overcome the outside political committees that helped Gonzalez.\n\nThe Florida Medical Association alone spent more than $375,000 through a pair of political action committees to run ads against DeNapoli.\n\n\u201cWe were just outspent,\u201d said DeNapoli, who added he intends to remain in Venice.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://politics.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/08/SDIST74_5222613.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "Gonzalez wins House District 7", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8"}, "article_summary": "Click here for full election resultsAfter prevailing in bruising Republican primary Tuesday, Venice doctor Julio Gonzalez is poised to win the Florida House District 74 seat representing most of southern Sarasota County.\n\u201cI\u2019m relieved, because it is over,\u201d Gonzalez said Tuesday night from his victory party at Ophelia\u2019s Pasta House in Nokomis.\nGonzalez had to overcome attacks by DeNapoli about why Gonzalez gave a $500 donation to U.S. Rep.
