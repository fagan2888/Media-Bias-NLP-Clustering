It's a clear case of discrimination,\" said Greg Millett, vice president and director of public policy for amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research. \"We've heard anecdotal reports about this conduct before, but this study shows a clear pattern of discrimination.\"\n\nHowever, the findings by definition show that three out of four plans are offering HIV coverage at more reasonable rates, said Clare Krusing, director of communications for America's Health Insurance Plans, an insurance industry group. Patients with HIV can choose to move to one of those plans.\n\n\"This report really misses that point, and I think that's the overarching component that is important to highlight,\" Krusing said. \"Consumers do have that choice, and that choice is an important part of the marketplace.\"\n\nThe Harvard researchers undertook their study after hearing of a formal complaint submitted to federal regulators in May, which contended that Florida insurers had structured their drug coverage to discourage enrollment by HIV patients, according to background information in the paper.\n\nThey decided to analyze the drug pricing policies of 48 health plans offered through 12 states' insurance marketplaces.\n\nThe researchers focused on six states mentioned in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) complaint: Delaware, Florida, Louisiana, Michigan, South Carolina and Utah. They also analyzed plans offered through the six most populous states that did not have any insurers mentioned in the HHS complaint: Illinois, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia.\n\nThe researchers' analysis compared cost-sharing for a commonly prescribed class of HIV medication -- nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, or NRTIs. They specifically looked for plans that had placed all versions of these drugs, both brand-name and generic, in categories that required patients to pay 30 percent or more of the cost.\n\nAbout 25 percent of the plans used discriminatory cost-sharing for NRTIs, the researchers concluded. HIV patients in those plans on average paid three times more for HIV medications than people in other health plans, according to the report.\n\nEven though annual premiums in the plans tended to be lower than other plans, the high cost of HIV drugs meant that, on average, a person with HIV would pay $3,000 more for treatment each year than if he or she had instead enrolled in a plan with lower drug co-pays.\n\n\"It's clearly a violation of a host of discrimination provisions that were set out in the Affordable Care Act,\" said Lydia Mitts, a senior policy analyst for Families USA, a health consumer advocacy group.", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"Coronary heart disease is the most common type of heart disease in the U.S.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "Analysis suggests hiking drug co-pays may help eliminate people with certain illnesses", "zone": "homepage/articles", "og": {"url": "http://health.usnews.com/health-news/articles/2015/01/28/have-insurers-found-way-around-obamacare-pre-existing-conditions-rule", "site_name": "US News & World Report", "type": "article", "description": "Analysis suggests hiking drug co-pays may help eliminate people with certain illnesses", "title": "Have Insurers Found Way Around Obamacare 'Pre-Existing Conditions' Rule?"}, "twitter": {"title": "Have Insurers Found Way Around Obamacare 'Pre-Existing Conditions' Rule? - US News", "description": "Analysis suggests hiking drug co-pays may help eliminate people with certain illnesses", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "health-news", "keywords": "Collections: Health,HealthDay,drugs,government,health,insurance,prescription drugs", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "published_at": "2015-01-28", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2015-01-28"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z69szz", "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd05dd\"", "article_summary": "HIV patients in those plans on average paid three times more for HIV medications than people in other health plans, according to the report.\nThey decided to analyze the drug pricing policies of 48 health plans offered through 12 states' insurance marketplaces.\nHowever, the findings by definition show that three out of four plans are offering HIV coverage at more reasonable rates, said Clare Krusing, director of communications for America's Health Insurance Plans, an insurance industry group.\nThe researchers' analysis compared cost-sharing for a commonly prescribed class of HIV medication -- nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, or NRTIs.\n\"This report really misses that point, and I think that's the overarching component that is important to highlight,\" Krusing said."}
