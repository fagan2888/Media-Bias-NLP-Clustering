(If you haven\u2019t yet seen the amazing chart that PBS Newshour put together, you really should.) One big dispute was over what happened after the initial altercation at Wilson\u2019s police vehicle, once Brown had run away and Wilson had chased him. Brown eventually turned back towards Wilson and, according to virtually every witness who testified, Brown raised his hands when he did so. But did Brown raise them high or low? Were they palms out, as if he was surrendering, or balled up in a fist, as if he was making an aggressive move? The forensic evidence seems to make clear that Brown started moving back towards Wilson\u2014but was he charging or staggering? Again, the witnesses say different things.\n\nNone of this is surprising. Witness recollections are notoriously subjective and inaccurate, as Paul Campos noted at Salon last week. Maybe the real story is that both Wilson and Brown were aggressive, from the very beginning of the encounter. Maybe Wilson ultimately acted in a way that Missouri law justifies (because it gives police enormous leeway to shoot suspects who have shown hostility) but many Americans would not condone (because they don\u2019t want cops shooting people unless they pose clear, immediate threats to safety).\n\nThat\u2019s just one possibility\u2014a guess, from somebody trying to make sense of information that doesn\u2019t always make sense. We know enough about patterns of behavior\u2014and about racial disparities in political and economic power\u2014to know something is very wrong in Ferguson, and in countless communities like it. But we don\u2019t really know what happened on August 9 and, at this point, we may never know.\n\n\u2014Jonathan Cohn\n\nNews from the last few days\n\nRAY RICE: A federal arbitrator reinstated Rice, arguing that the NFL acted improperly when, after suspending him for two games, it late increased the penalty to an indefinite ban.
