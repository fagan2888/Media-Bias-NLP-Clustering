The Koch brothers-backed shutdown machine of the House GOP tried every argument to keep from reopening government and raising the debt limit: Obamacare is socialism, yada yada. But Salon points out one argument we had not heard yet:

Republican Rep. Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina voted against the Senate’s debt deal in part because he somehow thought it provided funding to Joseph Kony, Ugandan despot and leader of the Lord’s Resistance Army.

A statement from Mulvaney said:

“Finally, the ‘deal’ is full of pork. A dam project in Kentucky got extra money; the state of Colorado got money to help with its flooding; and the ‘Lord’s Resistance Army’ received special funds. Those may be worth discussing, but that will never happen now, as they were crammed into this ‘deal’ in order to help it pass.”

What Mulvaney is essentially saying here is that he’d be totally into funding Joseph Kony if you’d just let him discuss it first!

Actually, as notes, HuffPo, the bill provided funding for the Pentagon to fight against the Lord’s Resistance Army.

That should give you some indication of the brainpower behind this shutdown effort. Salon notes Mulvaney’s statement has since been scrubbed of references to the LRA, but the original is attached below, also via Salon:
