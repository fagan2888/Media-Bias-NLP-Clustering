ModCloth recently agreed \"to do our best not to change the shape, size, proportion, color and/or remove/enhance the physical features of people in our ads in post-production\" as part of the \u201cTruth in Advertising Heroes Pledge.\u201d\n\n\"The reality is that women are being altered and misrepresented in the fashion industry, and as our findings show, these false depictions are affecting them negatively,\" ModCloth\u2019s Cofounder and Chief Creative Officer Susan Koger said in a statement. \"ModCloth's mission is to help women feel like the best version of themselves and we are calling upon other fashion companies to step up to the plate and challenge the status quo.\"\n\nModCloth surveyed over 1,500 women in the United States between the ages of 18 and 44 to find out how the average woman\u2019s emotions and shopping behaviors are influenced by fashion advertisements. Only 13 percent of women included in the survey agreed that \u201creal women\u201d are used in fashion advertisements. More often than not women feel left out and are unable to relate with fashion industry advertisements. For example, 65 percent of women said they \u201cnever\u201d or \u201crarely\u201d see models with their size in a fashion ads while two-thirds said they were more likely to buy from a company that uses \u201creal women\u201d as models.\n\nPlus-size women were even more likely to feel that models with their body size were not represented in print or TV fashion advertisements. Over 75 percent of plus-size women said they \u201cnever\u201d or \u201crarely\u201d saw themselves in a fashion ad. Only around 25 percent said \"there are many good role models for women\" in the fashion industry or that it \"celebrates beauty in many forms.\" Defying the idea that women would rather purchase their clothing from a store with \u201caspirational\u201d advertisement, just under half of the women surveyed by ModCloth said they actively tried to avoid designers that used ultra-thin models as their standard for beauty.\n\n\u201cNow\u2019s the time for the fashion industry to start using its power for good,\u201d explained Gregg Koger. \u201cImagine a world where flipping through a fashion magazine is an empowering and life-affirming experience! That\u2019s a world I want to live in, and that would be an industry I\u2019d be proud to be a part of.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cTruth in Fashion\u201d report also revealed that 62 percent of women feel a negative self-body image is being perpetuated by the fashion industry. Apparently, weight isn\u2019t the only problem women have with fashion advertisements. Fifty-eight percent of respondents were more likely to buy from a store that used models from different ethnicities and 52 percent said they were more likely to shop if advertisements featured models of different heights.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "model, fashion, ads", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Sixty-five percent of women said they \u201cnever\u201d or \u201crarely\u201d see models with their size in a fashion advertisement.", "title": "Shoppers Want More 'Real Women' In Fashion Ads", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/plus-size-shopping-over-23-women-are-more-likely-shop-stores-advertise-models-different-301356", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/04/plus-size-model.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sixty-five percent of women said they \u201cnever\u201d or \u201crarely\u201d see models with their size in a fashion advertisement.", "title": "Shoppers Want More 'Real Women' In Fashion Ads", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/plus-size-shopping-over-23-women-are-more-likely-shop-stores-advertise-models-different-301356", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/04/plus-size-model.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/04/plus-size-model.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-09-04T17:25:29-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-04T17:25:28-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Sixty-five percent of women said they \u201cnever\u201d or \u201crarely\u201d see models with their size in a fashion advertisement."}, "article_summary": "Fifty-eight percent of respondents were more likely to buy from a store that used models from different ethnicities and 52 percent said they were more likely to shop if advertisements featured models of different heights.\nOnly 13 percent of women included in the survey agreed that \u201creal women\u201d are used in fashion advertisements.\nMore often than not women feel left out and are unable to relate with fashion industry advertisements.\nPlus-size women were even more likely to feel that models with their body size were not represented in print or TV fashion advertisements.\n\u201cNow\u2019s the time for the fashion industry to start using its power for good,\u201d explained Gregg Koger."}
