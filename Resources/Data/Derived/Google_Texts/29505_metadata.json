The $5,000 asset test, which is defined in a federal law but has been waived in Maine in recent years, will not include the value of a home or a household\u2019s primary vehicle.\n\nDHHS already has access to a database of statewide vehicle registrations which would be used to enforce the asset test, according to DHHS spokesman David Sorensen. Implementing the new rule does not require legislative approval.\n\nDemocrats and Maine Equal Justice Partners, an advocacy group for low-income Mainers, resisted the change on the grounds that it does nothing to address the problem of finding routes out of poverty for the close to 200,000 Mainers who collect food stamps from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any motion on that front,\u201d said Christine Hastedt, public policy director for Maine Equal Justice Partners.\n\nA public hearing on the proposed new rule is scheduled for Oct. 6 in Augusta.\n\n\u201cMost Mainers would agree that before someone received taxpayer-funded welfare benefits, they should sell nonessential assets and use their savings,\u201d said Gov. Paul LePage in a written statement. \u201cHardworking Mainers should not come home to see snowmobiles, four-wheelers or jet skis in the yards of those who are getting welfare. Welfare is a last resort, not a way of life.\u201d\n\nDHHS estimates that the rule change would affect about 8,600 people who are on food stamps, but Democrats said the reason Maine has waived the use of the asset test is because social safety nets such as food stamps are designed to catch people before they fall far enough to hit rock bottom.\n\n\u201cCommon sense says that someone with a ton of cash on hand isn\u2019t truly needy, but Gov. LePage and Commissioner [DHHS Commissioner Mary] Mayhew are willing to make someone\u2019s ability to eat contingent on whether they\u2019re able to sell their beat-up snowmobile in Uncle Henry\u2019s,\u201d said Rep. Drew Gattine, D-Westbrook, co-chairman of the Legislature\u2019s Health and Human Services Committee. \u201cWhat next? Grandma can\u2019t buy groceries until she sells her engagement ring? They need to focus on growing economic opportunity and moving people into sustainable employment rather than adding a layer of bureaucracy to government that does nothing to save taxpayer dollars or help people in real need.\u201d\n\nHouse Minority Leader Ken Fredette, R-Newport, applauded LePage and DHHS for the initiative.\n\n\u201cOur limited state tax dollars must be used for those most in need and not those who would abuse our system of supporting those who should be receiving this type of assistance,\u201d said Fredette in a prepared statement.\n\nHastedt said Maine and 37 other states waive the asset test, partially because such systems have high error levels, cutting people off benefits when they can least afford it while mistakenly providing benefits to others.\n\n\u201cThere are very few families that have significant assets that get this benefit, and it\u2019s extremely administratively burdensome and error-prone to have these tests in the law,\u201d said Hastedt. \u201cSomebody works at a paper mill and they are laid off for three months and they need help during that period. Are they supposed to sell everything they\u2019ve worked for over the years for a temporary period of employment?\u201d\n\nMaine already has reduced the number of Mainers collecting food stamps with a rule implemented by the LePage administration that requires able-bodied 18- to 49-year-old adults to either be working or in an active job search in order to receive food stamps.\n\nAccording to a data website called assetsandopportunity.org, states have been able to claim waivers from SNAP asset tests since 2002 but most states that went that direction waited until passage of the 2008 Farm Bill, which made changes to the program.\n\nA total of 35 states have eliminated asset limit tests for SNAP/food stamps and 39 states, including Maine, don\u2019t use asset tests for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. All states were required to eliminate asset tests for Medicaid in 2014 under the provisions of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMaine and the majority of states, 42 in all, require an assets test for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. In Maine, the limit for TANF is $2,000 in assets.\n\n\u201cWhen people see that some are using welfare as a first line of defense to keep their boats and motorcycles, rather than using welfare as a safety net, it hurts the public perception of the program,\u201d said Mayhew in a prepared statement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "AUGUSTA, Maine \u2014 Mainers with assets topping $5,000 and who don\u2019t have children will be ineligible for food stamps under a new plan announced Wednesday by the Department of Health and Human Services.
