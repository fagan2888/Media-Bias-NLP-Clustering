Not only for him, but also for young transgender people hoping to one day make their transition with the help of hormone therapy. Over the course of three years, Raines compiled 1,400 selfies to chronicle his entire transition, which will be featured in an upcoming British documentary titled \u201cGirls to Men.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I first started I tried not to have an image in my mind \u2014 I was taking testosterone so I could go through the correct puberty for me \u2014 and I tried not to have expectations, because testosterone affects everyone differently and different changes come in at different points,\u201d Rainers told BuzzFeed. \u201cSome people get loads of facial hair within the first six months, and some people never get it. I didn\u2019t pin too many hopes on T [testosterone] changing me drastically and just took the changes as they came.\u201d\n\nAlthough Raines initially planned on documenting the first year of his transition, he decided to keep going when he didn\u2019t develop any facial after the first couple of months. He knew that testosterone affects everyone differently and didn\u2019t want to get his hopes up. Nevertheless, around three years after starting hormone therapy Raines developed the full beard and deeper voice he has been waiting for. He hopes that more transgender people will realize the process does not take place overnight and that patience is a requirement.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "transgender, man, takes, 1400, selfies, document, his, entire, transition", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Transgender man takes 1,400 selfies over the course of three years to document his transition during hormone therapy.", "title": "One Transgender Man's Transition In 1,400 Selfies", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/transgender-man-takes-1400-selfies-document-his-entire-transition-356490", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/10/08/woman-man-transgender-man-takes-1400-selfies-document-his-entire-transition.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Transgender man takes 1,400 selfies over the course of three years to document his transition during hormone therapy.", "title": "One Transgender Man's Transition In 1,400 Selfies", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/transgender-man-takes-1400-selfies-document-his-entire-transition-356490", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/10/08/woman-man-transgender-man-takes-1400-selfies-document-his-entire-transition.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/10/08/woman-man-transgender-man-takes-1400-selfies-document-his-entire-transition.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-10-08T17:20:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-09T10:50:55-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Transgender man takes 1,400 selfies over the course of three years to document his transition during hormone therapy."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2010\"", "article_summary": "As transgender YouTube star Jamie Raines, 21, was getting ready to start taking testosterone, he knew it was worth documenting.\nNevertheless, around three years after starting hormone therapy Raines developed the full beard and deeper voice he has been waiting for.\nNot only for him, but also for young transgender people hoping to one day make their transition with the help of hormone therapy.\nHe hopes that more transgender people will realize the process does not take place overnight and that patience is a requirement.\nHe knew that testosterone affects everyone differently and didn\u2019t want to get his hopes up."}
