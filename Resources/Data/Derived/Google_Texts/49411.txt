One man was killed and two others seriously injured in a two-vehicle, head-on crash north of Boulder early Sunday morning, the Colorado State Patrol said.

The crash, which happened about 2:30 a.m. near the intersection of U.S. 36 and Neva Road, involved a 2006 Toyota and a 2013 Hyundai.

The Toyota was headed eastbound, drifted into oncoming traffic and hit the Hyundai -- which was carrying two people -- head-on, according to the state patrol.

The passenger in the Hyundai, 38-year-old Lester Williams, of Thornton, was pronounced dead at the scene. The driver, 35-year-old Kurt Rose, of Longmont, was taken to Boulder Community Hospital with serious injuries, Sgt. Rob Madden said.

The driver of the Toyota, 44-year-old Jeremy Schepps, of Boulder, also was taken to Boulder Community Hospital with serious injuries.

U.S. 36 was closed for about five hours while troopers investigated the crash.

Alcohol and drugs are suspected to be factors in the accident, Madden said, but a determination hasn't been made yet on whether charges will be filed.
