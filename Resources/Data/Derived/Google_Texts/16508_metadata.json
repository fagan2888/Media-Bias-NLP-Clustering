And, Jenkins adds, she\u2019s a female chief executive of a nearly-38-million-member-strong organization that\u2019s been dominated by male leaders since its founding by Ethel Percy Andrus.\n\n\u201cComing to AARP, it all seems more relevant,\u201d Jenkins said last month in an interview at the group\u2019s Washington headquarters.\n\nJenkins took over the top slot at the AARP in September, after both heading up the organization\u2019s charitable arm and serving as its chief operating officer. Before that she had several stops in the federal government, including three agencies and the Library of Congress.\n\nIn her interview, Jenkins acknowledged the challenges the group faces in being a voice for everyone who\u2019s made it to 50, a group that represents an increasing share of the U.S. population \u2014 currently around a third, according to the Census Bureau \u2014 and comes in all races and with a wide range of political beliefs.\n\nBut while the new chief executive said she was seeking to put her own stamp on the organization, she showed no interest in narrowing the AARP\u2019s interests and scope, after some critics have said that the group hurts itself by having too broad of an agenda.\n\nInstead, Jenkins said she wants the AARP to concentrate on health and financial security and personal fulfillment \u2014 or \u201chealth, wealth and self,\u201d as she puts it \u2014 and makes no apologies for her group\u2019s support of President Obama\u2019s healthcare reform law or for preserving Social Security benefits for current seniors.\n\nEven more broadly, Jenkins believes the country needs to recalibrate how it discusses aging, given that people could have one or even two more careers if they retire at 55. \u201cFifty is the new 50,\u201d Jenkins likes to say. \u201cIt\u2019s not the new 30 or the new 40.\u201d\n\nThat comes after her tenure at the AARP Foundation, where she made helping low-income people over the age of 50 her top priority.\n\n\u201cOur ability to live longer is probably one of mankind\u2019s biggest accomplishments,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cAnd yet, it also has to prepare us to live another 30 or 40 years past what we thought about as traditional retirement.\u201d\n\nAn Alabama native, Jenkins first came to Washington for an internship while she was still a student at Spring Hill College in Mobile.\n\nAfter graduating, Jenkins worked briefly at the Alabama Power Co. as a collections agent for people behind on their bills. But after just a paycheck or two, Jenkins says she jumped at the chance to come back to Washington and work under Ronald Reagan.\n\nAfter that, she worked at a string of positions within the federal government that prepared her for her current gig, including at the Housing and Urban Development Department, where she dealt with housing issues for the poor.\n\nAt the Transportation Department, where she worked with then-Secretary Elizabeth Dole, Jenkins concentrated on increasing the number of women working at places like the Federal Aviation Administration and the Coast Guard.\n\nImmediately before heading over to the AARP Foundation, Jenkins was the chief operating officer for the Library of Congress, a job she says taught her more than a little about holding a nonpartisan post in a partisan city.\n\n\u201cYou never knew who in two years your boss was going to be,\u201d she said of her 15 years at the library.\n\nJenkins has no doubt that training will serve her well at the AARP, which is still feeling the effects of its decision to back the Affordable Care Act and is facing a Congress fully controlled by Republicans \u2014 many of whom want to overhaul Medicare and Social Security.\n\nThe decision to get behind healthcare reform enraged many of the group\u2019s conservative members, to the point that the AARP acknowledged in 2009 that it lost tens of thousands of members over its stance. Anger on the right got so pronounced that a group of House Republicans in 2011 urged the IRS to take another look at the AARP\u2019s tax-exempt status, suggesting the seniors organization stood to profit off the healthcare law with its supplemental insurance offerings.\n\nBut as Jenkins noted, the AARP is used to that sort of criticism. Well before the debate over ObamaCare even started, she noted, liberals knocked the AARP for backing GOP efforts to expand prescription drug benefits under Medicare. That also points to a broader \u201cgreedy geezers\u201d criticism that the AARP has faced \u2014 that it puts the interests of seniors over the health of the country.\n\n\u201cObviously, AARP is a nonpartisan organization,\u201d Jenkins said, brushing aside the criticism. \u201cSometimes we get pulled to the left, sometimes pulled to the right.\u201d\n\nWith that in mind, Jenkins says it should be no surprise that the AARP would back a healthcare law that closes the so-called \u201cdoughnut hole\u201d for prescription drug coverage for seniors and allowed children to stay on their parents\u2019 insurance until they were 26.\n\nAs Social Security approaches its 80th birthday this August, Jenkins, like top lawmakers in both parties, hopes to shore up the program before it reaches a crisis point \u2014 a period analysts say is likely around two decades away.\n\nFewer people are now paying into Social Security per beneficiary, and seniors are living longer. But Jenkins said there\u2019s widespread support among AARP members regardless of political affiliation about preserving benefits and noted that older voters are known for consistently heading to the polls.\n\n\u201cWhatever we do should not be cutting the benefits of those who are in the system now,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cThis is not an entitlement program. This is something that they have paid in and worked to.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\u201cFifty is the new 50,\u201d the AARP's Jo Ann Jenkins likes to say.", "description": "\u201cFifty is the new 50,\u201d the AARP's Jo Ann Jenkins likes to say.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Bernie Becker", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "\u201cFifty is the new 50,\u201d the AARP's Jo Ann Jenkins likes to say.", "title": "In action for the retired", "url": "http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/229281-in-action-for-the-retired", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/jenkinsjoann_121714gn.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:59-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/229281-in-action-for-the-retired", "dcterms.date": "2015-01-13T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Bernie Becker", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-13T06:17:19-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/229281-in-action-for-the-retired", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "\u201cFifty is the new 50,\u201d the AARP's Jo Ann Jenkins likes to say.", "card": "summary", "title": "In action for the retired"}, "dcterms.title": "In action for the retired"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca37e\"", "article_summary": "After graduating, Jenkins worked briefly at the Alabama Power Co. as a collections agent for people behind on their bills.\nFor Jo Ann Jenkins, heading up the AARP is nothing but a fitting final chapter to her career in Washington.\nFewer people are now paying into Social Security per beneficiary, and seniors are living longer.\n\u201cObviously, AARP is a nonpartisan organization,\u201d Jenkins said, brushing aside the criticism.\n\u201cComing to AARP, it all seems more relevant,\u201d Jenkins said last month in an interview at the group\u2019s Washington headquarters."}
