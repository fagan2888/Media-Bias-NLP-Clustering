LONDON, Ky. (AP) - A federal grand jury has charged Paintsville Mayor Robert Porter and the former general manager of the public utility commission there with misappropriating property and city resources.

The U.S. attorney’s office says a grand jury in London, Kentucky, on Thursday charged Porter and Larry Herald with two counts of theft of government property. Herald was also charged with one count of intentionally making false statements to the FBI.

The indictment accuses Porter, with Herald’s help, of not paying for utilities on homes he owned from 2009 until 2012, totaling more than $7,000. Porter is also accused of using city funds to pay personal expenses and using a city vehicle for personal trips.

A message left at City Hall for Porter was not immediately returned. A message left at phone number listed in Herald’s name also was not immediately returned.
