The commander-in-chief knows how to rally the troops for Team USA.

President Obama joined White House staffers at a World Cup viewing party in the East Executive Office Building today, and he led them in a rousing chant.

"I believe, I believe, I believe that we will win," Obama chanted, pumping his fist as the crowd cheered and snapped pictures.

"I was worried if I walked in and Belgium scored, I'd be in trouble," the president joked.

He then asked the young man sitting next to him for a recap of the first half.

"It seems like the ball's on our side of the field, too much," Obama observed.

"Go, go! Oh, woah, that's a foul, give 'em a red card!" he exclaimed.

Earlier today, the president showed his team spirit on Twitter:

In America, we don't settle. We out-hustle the competition. That's who we are. Let's do this, @USSoccer! #IBelieve #USA -bo - The White House (@WhiteHouse) July 1, 2014

Last week, Obama told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos that the tournament has had subtle impacts on U.S. foreign policy.
