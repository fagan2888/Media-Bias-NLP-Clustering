They were generally concerned about mischief Bevin could make at the margins, because any additional hassle faced by insurance customers can dampen participation. But experts watching closely said they were skeptical Bevin would be able to deliver a grave setback to the progress the state has made through its Obamacare programs.\n\nBut what the Obamacare-hating Bevin has promised to do as Kentucky's new Republican governor versus what he may actually be able to do offers new insight into how entrenched Obamacare already is in the health care economy.\n\nOutgoing Democratic Gov. Steve Beshears' success in establishing a state-based health insurance exchange and significantly reducing the state's rate of uninsured has been a model nationwide, particularly since Kentucky remains a red state. Bevin's fierce anti-Obamacare campaign rhetoric had stoked fears among Democrats that if Bevin does what he promised to do then hundreds of thousands of Kentuckians could lose their insurance.\n\nBut the limitations that Bevin, a tea party favorite, will face in tearing apart the health care law that he and GOP lawmakers vehemently oppose show how deeply rooted the Affordable Care Act has become.\n\n\u201cObamacare is here to stay,\u201d Pearson said. \u201cAt this point it\u2019s going to be about how you deliver that coverage more efficiently and sort of modifying the flavor a bit, but none of it\u2019s going to disappear.\u201d\n\nBevin\u2019s plan to take on Obamacare\u2019s footprint in Kentucky has involved two prongs: turning the state exchange over to the feds and rolling back Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cLegally it can be done. The two big subsidy programs can be disrupted at a minimum and literally terminated at the worse,\u201d said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health policy at George Washington University. \u201cBut the price that his home state residents will pay is extraordinary and whether there are political considerations that will stop that kind of all-out onslaught remains to be seen.\u201d\n\nExperts can't be conclusive about what Bevin will or won't do because it\u2019s not entirely clear how Bevin plans to go about altering the law. Beshear -- who was term-limited -- pushed through both the state exchange and the Medicaid exchange with executive orders. There\u2019s reason to believe undoing them wouldn\u2019t be so simple for Bevin to do single-handedly, given the political realities. He has already changed his rhetoric significantly over the course of his campaign.\n\nWhen it comes to tackling the state exchange, Bevin\u2019s plan to eliminate it and move users on to a federal exchange is fairly clear cut, though it would not have a major impact on the benefits users receive from the marketplace, experts said.\n\n\u201cTo the extent that he wanted to disrupt things for people, that would be an option,\u201d Rosenbaum said. The turbulence the transition would cause should not be understated, as users would have to learn a new system. But states are required to give the federal government a year\u2019s notice before eliminating their own exchange, giving the feds time to smooth out the process.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason in terms eligibility why anybody should lose coverage, so the question would be, would they lose coverage because of some bureaucratic screw up in the transfer process,\u201d said Timothy Jost, a health law specialist at the Washington and Lee University School of Law. \u201cIf they give a year\u2019s notice, I think it should be feasible to make the transition and there shouldn\u2019t be too much chaos.\u201d\n\nBevin\u2019s intentions for the Medicaid expansion are much murkier. He could roll it back entirely, as he at first suggested he would do. But in more recent interviews -- perhaps due to political blowback -- he has said he would alter the expansion instead.\n\n\"We're going to use what's called 1115 waivers. An 1115 waiver will be our request to CMS [the federal agency that runs Medicaid] for basically the ability to take a block grant and customize as Indiana and others have done to actually come up with a program that will provide for these folks,\" Bevin told NBC News the day before the election. \"Nobody's losing anything.\n\nIn theory, the waiver program -- which dates back decades, to Medicaid before Obamacare -- is for states to try to out new ideas to make programs more effective. In practice, experts said, red states that have used them for Obamacare's Medicaid expansion have largely made their programs more complicated.\n\n\u201cA lot of this is bureaucratic busywork and punitive stuff that they want to run Medicaid recipients through because they do not want to give people health care and then what happens is people just give up,\u201d Jost says.\n\nEven here, however, Bevin will be limited in what the federal government\u2019s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is willing to approve.\n\n\"It is a big deal to establish a 1115 demonstration and it has taken the demo states months and months and months to put a demo together that the CMS will accept,\u201d Rosenbaum said.\n\nBevin has said he wanted to establish a premium for the Medicaid expansion program -- akin to Indiana\u2019s model -- and has also suggested that he would be able keep on the current enrollees in the expanded program but block out new recipients.\n\nBut Rosenbaum called the idea that he could cap or block new enrollees \"a total nonstarter\" for CMS and also said that even if Bevin followed Indiana's model to set up premiums, CMS has had some level of control of what Indiana has been allowed to do.\n\n\u201cCMS has been relatively conservative in not granting wide scale modifications to the program under the waivers,\u201d Pearson said. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of political rhetoric here where the Republican governors are able to hold up the waivers as an indication that they got a custom solution, but it\u2019s not having as dramatic of an effect as they are asserting.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"p": {"domain_verify": "da088b457e7d0e91a9f692968f1043c1"}, "og": {"site_name": "Talking Points Memo", "description": "Matt Bevin wouldn't be the first politician to over-promise and under-deliver. \n\nBut what the Obamacare-hating Bevin has promised to do as Kentucky's new Republican governor versus what he may actually be able to do offers new insight into how entrenched Obamacare already is in the health care economy.  \n\nTop health policy experts contacted by TPM the day after Bevin's victory weren't panicking or predicting a dramatic rollback of Obamacare in Kentucky.
