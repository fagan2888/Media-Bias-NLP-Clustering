Two of them are the buses carrying the Duquesne University men's basketball team and the Temple University women's gymnastics team.\n\nThe Duquesne team was heading home to Pittsburgh after Friday afternoon's victory against George Mason University in Virginia when the bus came to a \"dead stop\" about 9:15 p.m., head coach Jim Ferry told CNN.\n\nThe guys are trying to make the best of a trying situation, Ferry said of the 7-mile standstill. \"They're almost using it as a team-building experience,\" he said.\n\nTo pass the time, they posted polls on Twitter on Friday asking who should have to push the bus or who should get voted off the bus in case \"desperate times call for desperate measures.\" They made angels in the snow and visited a group of middle-schoolers from Iowa on the neighboring bus.\n\nOn Saturday, they'd run out of food and water as snow continued to pile up around them, but the National Guard and the local fire department delivered water.", "article_metadata": {"description": "About 500 vehicles are stuck on the Pennsylvania Turnpike because of snow, state police say.
