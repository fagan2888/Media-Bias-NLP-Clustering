Fear, then, is an important factor to be considered when recommending ways to improve conditioning. An international team of researchers found that a water-based exercise program, boosted by the S.W.E.A.T. method, helped women over the age of 60 to improve their functional activities of daily living as well as their static balance. \u201cAging is associated with a gradual decrease in muscle mass, strength and power,\u201d wrote the authors in their study, published last month in the Journal of Sports Science & Medicine. \u201cWater exercise may help to decrease immobility, while increasing power for functional skills.\u201d\n\nActivities of Daily Living\n\nActivities of daily living (ADLs) \u2014 simple things like the ability to shop for food, prepare a meal, and maintain personal hygiene \u2014 allow us to remain independent adults and lend us a sense of well-being. Maintaining function in the area of ADL, then, is what many elderly Americans fight for most. To study a program that might help older women keep up their ADL skills, researchers began by recruiting 66 volunteers between the ages of 60 and 89, each suffering with one or another chronic or age-related health condition. Next, the researchers tested each participant for flexibility, balance, and general physical condition. One such assessment was the sit-to-stand, which began with each participant seated in a chair with back straight, feet flat on the floor, and arms crossed and held against the chest. Next, she rose to a full standing position and then sat back down, as quickly as possible. The researchers recorded the number of times a participant completed a sit-to-stand, which determines lower body muscular strength and endurance, within 30 seconds.\n\nAfter completing an initial physical assessment, participants attended 16 weeks of water-based exercise sessions incorporating the S.W.E.A.T. method. This acronym is based on the cues that guide participants toward a greater awareness of how water helps them incorporate buoyancy and drag resistance in their interval-based training program. Each variable, when properly applied, changes how the properties of water are engaged against the body, and altogether this boosts the exercise program\u2019s ability to improve their physical condition. The not-perfectly-precise acronym is as follows:\n\nS. change Surface area and Speed\n\nW. Change impact by using the Working positions of rebound (jumping), neutral (chest submerged, feet touch lightly), suspended (buoyant work performed without feet touching bottom), and extended (standing tall, feet grounded on the bottom)\n\nE. Enlarge the movement (Extend to fuller range of motion)\n\nA. Work Around the body or joint by changing planes (sagital, transverse, and multiplaner)\n\nT. Travel through water forward, backward, and on diagonal\n\nUpon completion of the program, participants repeated the flexibility, balance, and conditioning tests and the researchers compared the results to their original scores. What did they find?\n\nThe group of participants, when compared to a control group, improved all functional ADL assessments. In particular, they made impressive gains in flexibility (eight percent), sit-to-stand endurance (31 percent), walking speed (16 percent), stride length (10 percent), agility (20 percent), stair climb (22 percent), arm curl (39 percent), and, best of all, static balance (42 to 48 percent). Oddly, no significant changes occurred in the area of dynamic balance.\n\n\u201cThis shallow water program provided a well-rounded, safe and effective activity for women to improve functional ADL on land,\u201d the authors wrote. When it comes to exercise, safe, more than sweat, is music to any older woman's ears.\n\nSource: Sanders ME, Takeshima N, Rogers ME, Colado JC, Borreani S. Impact of the S.W.E.A.T.
