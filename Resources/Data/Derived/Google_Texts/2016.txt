Saturday on MSNBC’s “Up w/Steve Kornacki,” Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-MD) claimed not only will House Democrats “survive” the 2014 midterm elections, but they will “take back the House.”

The Democratic Whip said “We’re going to survive.” He added Democrats will do better than expected, saying, “I think we can take back the House” in 2014 because the Democrats are “out-raising the Republicans.”

“Very frankly, my experience over the last three or four years is that republicans have a penchant for self-destruction,” Hoyer continued. “They have a penchant for doing things the American public say why are they doing that.”
