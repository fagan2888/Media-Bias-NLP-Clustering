Last fall, a unit of one of the nation\u2019s largest insurers, UnitedHealth Group, helped the administration repair the HealthCare.gov website after it crashed in the opening days of enrollment.\n\n\u201cInsurers and the government have developed a symbiotic relationship, nurtured by tens of billions of dollars that flow from the federal Treasury to insurers each year,\u201d said Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute.\n\nThe relationship is expected only to deepen as the two sides grow more intertwined.\n\n\u201cThese companies all look at government programs as growth markets,\u201d said Michael Tuffin, former executive vice president of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the main lobby for the industry. \u201cThere will be nearly $2 trillion of subsidized coverage through insurance exchanges and Medicaid over the next 10 years. These are pragmatic companies. They will follow the customer.\u201d\n\nSo much money is at stake that insurers may soon be on a collision course with the Republican majority in the new Congress. Insurers, often aligned with Republicans in the past, have built their business plans around the 2010 law and will strenuously resist Republican efforts to dismantle it. Since Obama signed the law in March 2010, share prices for four of the major insurance companies \u2014 Aetna, Cigna, Humana and UnitedHealth \u2014 have more than doubled, while the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has increased about 70 percent.\n\nWhatever Republicans do, over the next three months \u2014 the enrollment period \u2014 consumers will hear the same messages from insurance companies and the government urging them to sign up for health plans sold on the exchanges. Federal law requires most Americans to have coverage, insurers provide it, and the government subsidizes it.\n\n\u201cWe are in this together,\u201d Kevin Counihan, the chief executive of the federal insurance marketplace, told insurers at a recent conference in Washington. \u201cYou have been our partners,\u201d and for that, he said, \u201cwe are very grateful.\u201d\n\nDespite Obama\u2019s denunciations of insurers in 2009, it became inevitable that they would have a central role in expanding coverage under the Affordable Care Act later that year when Congress ruled out a government-run health plan \u2014 the \u201cpublic option.\u201d But friction between insurers and the Obama administration continued into 2013 as the industry bristled at stringent rules imposed on carriers in the name of consumer protection.\n\nA turning point came last fall, after the chaotic debut of HealthCare.gov, when insurers waived enrollment deadlines and helped the White House fix the dysfunctional website.\n\nNow insurers say government business is growing much faster than the market for commercial employer-sponsored coverage. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 170 million people will have coverage through Medicare, Medicaid and the insurance exchanges by 2023, an increase of about 50 percent from 2013. By contrast, the number of people with employer-based coverage is expected to rise just 2 percent, to 159 million.\n\nIn addition, the Affordable Care Act has engendered growth in the role of private insurers in Medicaid. The law expanded eligibility for Medicaid, and most of the new beneficiaries receive care from private health plans under contracts awarded by state Medicaid agencies. As a result, Medicaid enrollment is up more than 8 million, or 15 percent, in the last year.\n\nInsurers and the administration still have many disagreements, but open conflicts are rare.\n\n\u201cWith all the politics of the Affordable Care Act, people don\u2019t realize how much the industry has benefited, and will continue to benefit, from the law,\u201d said Jay Angoff, the Obama administration\u2019s top insurance regulator from 2010 through 2012.\n\nOne insurer, Humana, derives about 65 percent of its revenue from its Medicare Advantage plans. Enrollment in these plans climbed 17.5 percent, to 2.9 million, in the year that ended Sept. 30, the company said.\n\nAt UnitedHealth Group, Medicaid and Medicare Advantage together are expected to provide more than $60 billion in revenue, or slightly less than half of the company\u2019s total, this year. United expects to participate in insurance exchanges in 23 states next year, up from four this year.\n\n\u201cThe government, as a benefit sponsor, has been increasingly relying on private sector programs,\u201d United said in a document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cWe expect this trend to continue.\u201d\n\nIn another sign of the close relationship, the administration has recruited experts from the insurance industry to provide operational expertise. Eight months after the unit of UnitedHealth Group, called Optum, helped repair HealthCare.gov last fall, the administration hired a top Optum executive, Andrew Slavitt, as the No. 2 official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The administration waived conflict-of-interest rules so that Slavitt could participate in decisions affecting UnitedHealth and Optum.\n\nRobert Pear,\n\nThe New York Times", "article_metadata": {"description": "So much money is at stake that insurers may be on a collision course with the Republican majority in the new Congress.", "og": {"description": "So much money is at stake that insurers may be on a collision course with the Republican majority in the new Congress.", "title": "Insurers, Obama allied as Affordable Care Act boosts profits", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20141117-insurers-obama-allied-as-affordable-care-act-boosts-profits.ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-11-18T05:05:33Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-11-18T05:05:33Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Insurers, Obama allied as Affordable Care Act boosts profits\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20141117-insurers-obama-allied-as-affordable-care-act-boosts-profits.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2047530\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-11-18T05:05:33Z\", \"section\": \"Politics Headlines\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-11-18T05:05:33Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1bd4\"", "article_summary": "In addition, the Affordable Care Act has engendered growth in the role of private insurers in Medicaid.\nFederal law requires most Americans to have coverage, insurers provide it, and the government subsidizes it.\nThe law expanded eligibility for Medicaid, and most of the new beneficiaries receive care from private health plans under contracts awarded by state Medicaid agencies.\n\u201cThese companies all look at government programs as growth markets,\u201d said Michael Tuffin, former executive vice president of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the main lobby for the industry.\n\u201cThere will be nearly $2 trillion of subsidized coverage through insurance exchanges and Medicaid over the next 10 years."}
