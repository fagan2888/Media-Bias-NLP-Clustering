PLATTSMOUTH, Neb. (AP) — The family of a teen killed in a car accident plans to donate her organs to others.

Savannah Robertson, of Plattsmouth, was in a two-vehicle crash on Sunday on U.S. Highway 75. The 17-year-old died Monday. Robertson's passenger, 14-year-old Jenna Miner, of Murray, died at the scene.

Robertson's family told Omaha television station KETV that they decided to donate the teen's organs while she was on life-support. Her father, Philip Robertson II, said he wants something good to come out of the accident.

"She was just a good girl. She was all about giving. A couple days ago she gave — she cut off her hair to give to Locks of Love," Robertson said.

The donation of her organs and tissue is being processed by Nebraska Organ Recovery. Robertson said his daughter's organs will help eight people, while her tissue could go to 40 more.

"People are going to have a very Merry Christmas and the gift of life come tomorrow," Robertson said on Tuesday.

Nebraska Organ Recovery has helped thousands of families manage the organ donation process.

"It truly is the most unselfish gift of all — giving of yourself to save someone else's life," said Tom Neal, with Nebraska Organ Recovery.

The car crash happened Sunday morning near Plattsmouth when a car driven by Robertson crossed the center line and collided with a car driven by 36-year-old Travis Laporte, of Papillion.

Laporte and his brother, 34-year-old Kevin Laporte, of Bellevue, were in good condition Monday at the medical center.

Miner's father said the girls were close friends who were on the way to Omaha for Christmas shopping.
