(CNN) - Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has a dueling holiday message with the White House - forget Obamacare, go volunteer.

President Barack Obama's Twitter account tweeted earlier this week a picture of a man wearing plaid pajamas, encouraging people #GetTalking about insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act over the holidays.



"How do you plan to spend the cold days of December?" the tweet reads with the image, directing internet-users to barackobama.com/talk.

The internet, particularly conservatives, had a field day with the image and now Christie's office is picking up on the joke.

"In New Jersey, we are spending the cold days of December volunteering," the tweet reads, mimicking the design of the @BarackObama tweet but with a picture of the Garden State governor in an apron serving food.
