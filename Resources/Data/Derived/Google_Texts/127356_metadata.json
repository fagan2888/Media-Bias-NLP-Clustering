Analysts from Eljay LLC compiled the report by looking at data such as Medicaid cost reports and the long-term care inflation index known as the market basket.\n\nThis \u201chistoric\u201d shortfall translates to an estimated average Medicaid shortfall of $24.26 per Medicaid patient day. This exceeds last year's projected shortfall by 8.6%, the report notes.\n\nPutting a further strain on providers, Medicare reimbursements have been cut to the point that they no longer are fully subsidizing the Medicaid shortfall, according to the analysis.\n\n\u201cIt's tough to be optimistic, given the report,\u201d AHCA spokesman Greg Crist told McKnight's. But he was quick to add that there are reasons for providers to be circumspect about the findings.\n\nReimbursement rates have risen in some states, Crist noted. The rates still have been \u201coutstripped\u201d by rising costs, but lawmakers at least recognize that reimbursements need to be higher, he said.\n\nProviders are struggling with razor-thin margins and are \u201ckeenly aware\u201d of Medicaid shortfalls, and some have not been able to survive, but the long-term services and supports sector as a whole has not reached a \u201ctipping point,\u201d according to Crist.\n\nAs Medicaid managed care catches on in more states and Affordable Care Act payment models are implemented, many providers are in flux. Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, focused on these changes in his response to the report.\n\n\u201cI think the real news is buried in here, [which is] that we are in the midst of some real transformational change in the LTSS world,\u201d Salo told McKnight's.\n\nIn addition to the rise of managed care and dual eligibles demonstrations, Salo noted increased pressure to furnish home- and community-based care.\n\nProviders and LTC advocates should focus on this larger transformation and not get too \u201cbogged down in per unit costs,\u201d Salo said.\n\nIt's a point that Crist echoed, but with a note of caution.\n\n\u201cLawmakers say managed care is going to be the elixir to cure our Medicaid woes,\u201d Crist said. \u201cOur members aren't so sure.\u201d\n\nCrist said \u201cuncertainty\u201d is the \u201cwatchword\u201d for providers as the market adjusts to the changes underway.\n\nClick here to access the complete report, released Tuesday.", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages05.net,forms.mcknights.com,mcknights.com,media.mcknights.com", "news_keywords": "Long-Term Care, Medicaid Managed Care, Medicare, Medicaid Shortfall, LTSS", "content-language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "McKnight's", "description": "Medicaid underfunded long-term care by the greatest margin on record in 2013, according to a new report from the American Health Care Association/National Center for Assisted Living, the nation's largest long-term care provider association.", "title": "Gap between long-term care costs and Medicaid payments was widest ever last year, report finds", "url": "http://www.mcknights.com/news/gap-between-long-term-care-costs-and-medicaid-payments-was-widest-ever-last-year-report-finds/article/329366/", "image": "http://media.mcknights.com/images/2013/02/05/payment-_money_342167_342168.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Medicaid underfunded long-term care by the greatest margin on record in 2013, according to a new report from the American Health Care Association/National Center for Assisted Living, the nation's largest long-term care provider association.", "creator": "@@TimMullaneyLTC", "image": {"src": "http://media.mcknights.com/images/2013/02/05/payment-_money_342167_342168.jpg"}, "title": "Gap between long-term care costs and Medicaid payments was widest ever last year, report finds", "site": "@mcknightsltcn", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 183363395035820}, "google-site-verification": "mx4rGVRiNxzj0lwxNljynJz1gArTEK6bZ0rK6AzvXic", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "LTSS", "published_time": "2014-01-15T06:30:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-15T01:34:40"}, "Content-Type": "text/html", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Medicaid underfunded long-term care by the greatest margin on record in 2013, according to a new report from the American Health Care Association/National Center for Assisted Living, the nation's largest long-term care provider association."}, "article_summary": "Gap between long-term care costs and Medicaid payments was widest ever last year, report findsShare this content:linkedingoogleEmailPrintMedPAC will recommend site-neutral payments, but not for strokesMedicaid underfunded long-term care by the greatest margin on record in 2013, according to a new report from the American Health Care Association/National Center for Assisted Living, the nation's largest long-term care provider association.\nThis \u201chistoric\u201d shortfall translates to an estimated average Medicaid shortfall of $24.26 per Medicaid patient day.\nAnalysts from Eljay LLC compiled the report by looking at data such as Medicaid cost reports and the long-term care inflation index known as the market basket.\nAs Medicaid managed care catches on in more states and Affordable Care Act payment models are implemented, many providers are in flux.\nProviders and LTC advocates should focus on this larger transformation and not get too \u201cbogged down in per unit costs,\u201d Salo said."}
