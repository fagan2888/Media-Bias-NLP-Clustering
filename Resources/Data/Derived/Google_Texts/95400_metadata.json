Gray won gold in 2012 at 67 kg, and earned bronze in 2011 and 2013 at the same weight.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if women get the same credit for winning the 2012 world championship,\u201d Gray said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s the same year as the Olympics and some countries don\u2019t come. In my heart, I consider it a world championship. I definitely earned the world championship this year. I\u2019m the best girl in the world and that\u2019s an amazing feeling.\u201d\n\nGray scored early, connecting on a single-leg attack on da Silva, which resulted in a takedown in the first period.\n\nIt was all the points she needed.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s always dangerous,\u201d Gray said in a statement. \u201cI tried to play it a little more safe this time. But a win\u2019s a win. I got that gold medal and that\u2019s what matters.\u201d\n\nGray becomes the fourth American woman to win at least four medals at the world championships, joining Kristie Marano, Trish Saunders and Shannon Williams.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Adeline Gray of Denver wins gold at World Wrestling Championship", "title": "Adeline Gray of Denver wins gold at World Wrestling Championship", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/11/adeline-gray-of-denver-wins-gold-at-world-wrestling-championship/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140911_113354_adeline-gray.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140911_113354_adeline-gray.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-11T11:35:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:21:51+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0fb3\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI don\u2019t know if women get the same credit for winning the 2012 world championship,\u201d Gray said in a statement.\nIn my heart, I consider it a world championship.\nAdeline Gray captured her second gold medal when she defeated Brazil\u2019s Aline da Silva 2-1 on Thursday at the 2014 World Wrestling Championships at the Gymnastics Palace in Tashkent, Uzbekistan.\nI definitely earned the world championship this year.\nGray won gold in 2012 at 67 kg, and earned bronze in 2011 and 2013 at the same weight."}
