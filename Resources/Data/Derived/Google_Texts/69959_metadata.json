She says she\u2019d finished all of her work preparing food at a University of Vermont dining hall and the head chef told her she could go home. She clocked out 14 minutes early. The next week, she says, she was called into the manager\u2019s office and put on \u201cinvestigatory leave\u201d for alleged violations of her employer\u2019s attendance policy.\n\nSmith works for Sodexo, the university\u2019s food services contractor, and says company policies and management are disrespectful to employees.\n\n\u201cI truly believe I was set up,\u201d she says. Smith says the manager at Cook Commons doesn\u2019t like her, and used Sodexo\u2019s points-based attendance policy to push her out.\n\nSmith's situation has become a flashpoint for a larger, long-running effort to secure more worker protections for Sodexo employees at UVM. More than 1,000 people signed a petition to UVM administrators calling on Smith to be reinstated and to ensure better worker protections for Sodexo employees on campus.\n\nIt\u2019s the second time in as many years that workers advocates at UVM have pressured university officials to do more to protect food service workers. In late 2013, labor advocates successfully lobbied the administration to stop Sodexo from implementing a new policy that would change the way workers qualified as \u201cfull-time\u201d and, critics said, cause many employees on campus to lose benefits. Sodexo officials claimed the change was necessary under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNow, critics of the company are focusing on the company\u2019s treatment of employees and its attendance policy, which they say pressures employees to come to work even if they\u2019re sick. They also say management practices make employees fearful that they\u2019ll be punished, or even lose their job, if they speak up about working conditions.\n\nAdvocates say public pressure is important now as UVM negotiates a new contract with Sodexo. They\u2019re urging university officials to insert language in the contract that ensures stronger worker protections.\n\nCurrently, the contract requires university approval of changes to the benefits for Sodexo employees on campus, but advocates want it to specifically mandate certain protections, such as time off and a livable wage as defined by Burlington city ordinance.\n\nThey also want the university and Sodexo to address what some employees say is a culture of disrespect.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of being degraded. I\u2019m sick of being harassed. I\u2019m sick of being treated like a little kid. I\u2019m sick of feeling like I can\u2019t do my job right when I\u2019ve been doing it as long as I have,\u201d Smith says. She\u2019s on paid leave still, awaiting a meeting with Sodexo management to find out if she\u2019ll be allowed to return to work.\n\nThe policy Smith allegedly violated allows workers a limit of seven \u201cpoints\u201d in a rolling 12-month period. Workers are assessed a point if they miss work or half a point if they arrive late or leave early. Smith\u2019s manager told her going into 2015 that she was approaching her points limit. She says he didn\u2019t tell her that she was also being assessed half points every time she left early with -- she believed -- permission from the head chef.\n\nAccording to Sodexo documents presented to Smith when she was put on leave, this happened on 17 separate occasions (totaling 8.5 points) from October 28, 2014 to April 2, 2015 \u2013 the day she was put on leave.\n\n\u201cIt was happening for a while,\u201d she says, \u201cand not me knowing, every time I left I got a half a point, even though a supervisor told me I could go. So I had no idea that the half-a-point and the half-a-point and the half-a-point were leading up to April second when I did my job in the morning, was called into the office \u2026 and he handed me an investigatory leave slip.\u201d\n\n\"We have strict policies regarding employees not coming to work when they're sick.\" - Enrico Dinges, Sodexo Spokesman\n\nNot all of Smith\u2019s points came from those early departures. According to the documents her manager handed her when she was placed on leave, Smith missed work on January 30 because she was sick. The document says she presented a doctor\u2019s note confirming that she was sick. Smith was assessed one point for the missed day.\n\nThat policy \u2013 of counting illnesses toward the seven point limit \u2013 is the target of heavy criticism from workers advocates on campus who say it pressures food service employees to come to work even if they\u2019re sick.\n\nSodexo spokesman Enrico Dinges says company policy is very clear on working while sick.\n\n\u201cWe have strict policies regarding employees not coming to work when they\u2019re sick,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have food safety training and sanitation guidelines, and we\u2019re specific in the fact that it\u2019s against company policy to come to work with certain symptoms that can impact food safety or their own safety.\u201d\n\nDinges says that is not in conflict with the company\u2019s official policy of assessing points for work missed because of an illness. He also notes that points are assessed per \u201coccurrence,\u201d not per day, so an employee who misses three consecutive days because of an illness would only receive one point.\n\n\"You basically have to ensure at all times that nothing goes wrong in your life during work hours.\" - Deb Ploof, Sodexo Employee at UVM\n\nStill, critics say the point system is inflexible and inconsiderate of the employees, who are not protected by a union.\n\n\u201cYou basically have to ensure at all times that nothing goes wrong in your life during work hours,\u201d says Deb Ploof, an employee who works at Sodexo\u2019s location in the university library. Ploof and Smith both say they\u2019ve seen employees struggle with the decision of whether not to leave work to pick up a sick child.\n\nThey also say this policy isn\u2019t the only problem in the workplace.\n\n\u201cI have seen people reprimanded in front of their coworkers until they were in tears. I have some good friends [here]. They have been told they were useless. They were disrespected, intimidated, and threatened with termination and write-ups, just for trying to do their job to the best of their ability,\u201d Ploof says. \u201cPeople being reprimanded for too much prep, too little prep, sweeping the floors earlier than scheduled even though they had nothing else to do at that time. No one should have to go to work every day wondering and worrying if they will make a wrong move, say the wrong thing, or stress about what may or may not happen during the course of that day. This is enough to make anyone sick.\u201d\n\nSmith agrees. She has several notes from her doctor that show concern about the workplace environment in the kitchen she works in.\n\n\u201cI continue to be very concerned about Cindy Smith,\u201d one note says. \u201cSpecifically, she reports what sounds like an unusually high amount of workplace stress. Cindy is a strong person who is able to speak up when she sees either a workplace problem or senses an interpersonal issue at work. While this might make others uncomfortable, it is not a fault to be able to express oneself.\u201d\n\n\"They're afraid to speak out. They're being treated terribly. Not only me, but my coworkers around campus.\" - Cindy Smith, Sodexo Employee at UVM\n\nSpeaking up has been rare among Sodexo employees in recent years. When advocates were lobbying against the full-time policy change in 2013, there was a notable lack of Sodexo employees publicly involved in that movement. Many employees, approached by reporters at that time, refused to speak publicly for fear of retribution.\n\n\u201cPeople are afraid in there \u2013 in Billings and Cook Commons,\u201d Smith says. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid to speak out. They\u2019re being treated terribly. Not only me, but my coworkers around campus.\u201d\n\nAt a rally on Friday in support of Smith and Sodexo workers at large, Ploof called on other Sodexo workers to join her in publicly talking about their conditions.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s anoyone, any of my coworkers out there that are still employed or not employed, I\u2019d like to urge them to please come forward, make your voice heard. Because until that happens, we\u2019re not going to see any changes with Sodexo.\u201d\n\nDinges, the Sodexo spokesman, said the company has no policies about what employees may say publicly outside of work hours, other than that they cannot speak on behalf of Sodexo.\n\n\u201cThere would be no effect if an employee on their own time, representing their own views, were to speak to the media,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a policy preventing freedom of speech.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "VPR News", "description": "Cindy Smith left work early on March 27.
