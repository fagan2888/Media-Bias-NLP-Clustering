Students at Russell Christian Academy got back to the classroom Monday.

Headmaster Joey Knight says even though this was the first day for students, the faculty and staff have spent a significant amount of time getting ready for the new year. And he says parents were also diligent in making plans to have students ready for this big day.

"We just appreciate that partnership we have here at Russell Christian Academy with our parents and with our church here at Russell," said Knight. "And our dedication of our staff making this first day just a tremendously great day. Hey we love smiling faces. We love happy children."

Knight says the opportunity for athletic and extracurricular activities continues this year. RCA remains a member of the Alabama Independent Schools Association. Students may participate in scholars bowls, debate and science fairs.

Russell was one of three Lauderdale County private schools to return to class Monday. Calvary Christian and Lamar also began the new year.
