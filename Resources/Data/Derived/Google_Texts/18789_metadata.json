Kansas Ave., and the other was at the Topeka and Shawnee County Public Library, 1515 S.W. 10th.\n\nIt was the focus on providing resources and assistance to caregivers that was of particular interest to those who gathered at the AARP office.\n\nMary Tritsch, director of communications for AARP Kansas, said a bill known as the Care Act was introduced during the 2015 Kansas Legislature. The bill was supported by AARP and its volunteer lobbyists.\n\nThough it didn\u2019t pass, the bill is to be addressed again during the 2016 Legislature.\n\nIts central components are to offer help to the estimated 600,000 people in Kansas who act as caregivers. While many take care of elderly relatives, caregivers also take care of younger people who may have an illness, disability or injuries suffered in an accident.\n\n\u201cOne of the first sessions this morning was on caregiving, which is really important in Kansas because we\u2019re trying to pass the Care Act to support caregivers,\u201d Tritsch said. \u201cIt was a great panel discussion of what caregivers do and how we can support them better.\u201d\n\nAmong those at Monday\u2019s gathering at the AARP Kansas office in Topeka was Judy Davis-Cole, 67, of Ottawa, who serves as an advocacy volunteer for the organization.\n\n\u201cThis is really a very timely conference for us,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause in the last legislative session, we were trying very hard to get the Care Act passed.\u201d\n\nDavis-Cole said there were no fiscal components attached to the Care Act as presented to the Legislature, \u201cwhich is one of the reasons we were a little surprised it didn\u2019t pass.\u201d\n\nShe said the Care Act would provide training to caregivers who would be providing hands-on care for family members and loved ones who had been released to their homes from the hospital.\n\nAdditionally, the Care Act calls for the patient to be able to identify an individual as a caregiver and thus make it possible for that person to have face-to-face contact with medical professionals \u2014 including physicians \u2014 before the person was released to his or her home.\n\nDavis-Cole said there are an estimated 600,000 caregivers in Kansas, most of whom are receiving no pay for taking care of their family members or loved ones. She said caregivers save the state an estimated $4 million annually as they care for people in their private homes.\n\nWith the emphasis on caregiving at Monday\u2019s White House Conference on Aging, Davis-Cole said she was hopeful the Care Act will be a greater priority for lawmakers during the 2016 Legislature.\n\nThe White House Conference on Aging \u2014 which was scheduled to run from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Topeka time Monday \u2014 also was to include celebrations of the 80th anniversary of Social Security and the 50th anniversary of Medicare.\n\nLocal AARP officials said Topekan Ann Garvin was a local delegate to the conference. Garvin is a former teacher at Topeka High School and Washburn University Board of Regents member.\n\nFor more information, visit www.whitehouseconferenceonaging.gov.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, Phil Anderson", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "About 25 AARP volunteers from across the state gathered Monday morning in Topeka to watch a live telecast of the White House Conference on Aging and gave a thumbs-up to the gathering's early emphasis on providing for the needs of caregivers.", "title": "Caregiving an emphasis at White House aging conference; Topekans gather at watch party", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/2015-07-13/caregiving-emphasis-white-house-aging-conference-topekans-gather-watch-party", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/14555906.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "About 25 AARP volunteers from across the state gathered Monday morning in Topeka to watch a live telecast of the White House Conference on Aging and gave a thumbs-up to the gathering\u2019s early emphasis on providing for the needs of caregivers.The conference, held about once every 10 years and streamed live on the White House Web page, got underway with comments from President Barack Obama, followed by panel discussions that addressed topics such as caregiving, Social Security, Medicare and the Older Americans Act."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca6d1\"", "article_summary": "With the emphasis on caregiving at Monday\u2019s White House Conference on Aging, Davis-Cole said she was hopeful the Care Act will be a greater priority for lawmakers during the 2016 Legislature.\nMary Tritsch, director of communications for AARP Kansas, said a bill known as the Care Act was introduced during the 2015 Kansas Legislature.\nOne was at AARP Kansas headquarters at 555 S.
