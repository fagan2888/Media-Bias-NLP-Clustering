(Photo: AP file )\n\nGov. Robert Bentley and Democratic gubernatorial nominee Parker Griffith agree on more issues than they probably care to admit.\n\nBoth men say they would prioritize job creation over the next four years. Both also say they will stress education, particularly increased aid to the state\u2019s well-regarded but limited pre-kindergarten program. Both men also can be critical of the Alabama Legislature.\n\nBut where they disagree, the disagreements are fundamental. Bentley has vociferously opposed expansion of Medicaid; Griffith has made the issue the centerpiece of his campaign. Griffith criticizes Bentley\u2019s performance on jobs, while Bentley expresses deep doubts over Griffith\u2019s assertions about Medicaid expansion and job creation.\n\nThere is also a difference in style. Asked to name three things emphasized on the campaign trail, Griffith stresses issues: jobs, Medicaid and an education lottery.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve become the Mexico of America,\u201d Griffith said in a recent interview. \u201cAs long as we do not emphasize education and the health of our citizens, we will continue to be the dumping ground for low-wage, poor-paying jobs.\u201d\n\nBentley, meanwhile, talks about his leadership style, saying he believes he has proven to be a trustworthy chief executive.\n\n\u201cWe can pick a number of things, the promises that we made and we can go down a list of those, like job creation and organization structure for jobs,\u201d the governor said in a recent interview. \u201cI think we have fulfilled those promises. We\u2019re not where we want to be, but we have fulfilled those promises we have made.\u201d\n\nJobs\n\nJob creation has been a focus of virtually every gubernatorial campaign since the 1970s. Bentley made employment the central part of his 2010 campaign for governor, and his ads highlight the state\u2019s performance in creating jobs. Griffith, in turn, cites manufacturing plants closing and suggests recruiting incentives have been wasted.\n\nThe statistics paint a more mixed picture than either candidate does. The unemployment rate in the state fell from 8.9 percent in January, 2011 to 6.6 percent in September. Manufacturing has added about 20,000 jobs in the state since September 2011, and the professional sector has seen growth as well.\n\nHowever, Alabama\u2019s unemployment is not above the national average, and the state\u2019s workforce has shrunk by 83,000 workers during the governor\u2019s term. After manufacturing, the sector creating the highest number of new jobs in Alabama has been leisure and hospitality, where wages tend to be low. The construction industry \u2014 arguably the worst hit by the recession \u2014 has also struggled to add workers throughout Bentley\u2019s time in office.\n\nThe governor takes a more measured tone on the job situation in person than in his campaign ads, noting the jobs created and tens of thousands of future jobs that may be coming to Alabama, but stressing more his efforts to create a more educated workforce to bring a better quality of employment to the state.\n\n\u201cAll I can do until our national economy turns around is put in place an organizational structure (and) create a number of skilled workers,\u201d Bentley said last week. \u201cWe\u2019re working on that. Eventually this economy is going to turn around, and when it does, Alabama is really poised to take off.\u201d\n\nIn particular, the governor cites millions of dollars put into workforce training, and notes that the opening of Golden Dragon Copper Tubing in Wilcox County \u2014 one of the poorest counties in the nation \u2014 has helped that county go from a Great Depression-level 23 percent unemployment rate in 2009 to an improved \u2014 if still miserable \u2014 13.7 percent today.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just getting everything ready, and if I\u2019m here another four years, we\u2019ll see the results of it,\u201d he said.\n\nGriffith suggested the state\u2019s citizens were not getting promised returns for incentives extended to firms, pointing to projects such as Remington Outdoor Co., which announced plans to build a plant in Huntsville in February. The company will receive tens of millions of dollars in direct aid and tax abatements. Remington officials have said the average salary at the plant will hover around $20 an hour, though jobs posted at the plant by the Alabama Industrial Development training website listed positions paying up to $15.50 an hour. A Remington spokesperson told The Decatur Daily in August that the average salary includes professionals, such as engineers and managers.\n\n\u201cWith Remington, hundreds of millions of dollars in future earnings for the state, we gave those away in incentives,\u201d Griffith said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same with Golden Dragon Copper Tubing. If Alabama is the second largest producer of automobiles in the United States, why is Alabama broke?\u201d\n\nBoth Bentley and Griffith say they want to move the state toward attracting more high-technology companies. Bentley points to the Accelerate Alabama plan, with its emphasis on research and development; Griffith said he would use the proceeds from an education lottery to improve funding for higher education. Bentley, while not an advocate of a lottery, said he would not oppose a statewide vote on the issue.\n\nOn income, the news is equally mixed. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median household income in the state rose 3 percent \u2014 to $42,849 \u2014 from 2012 to 2013, and the median hourly wage in the state also rose year-to-year, from $14.40 to $14.61 (about $30,388 annually), an increase of about 1.5 percent.\n\nHowever, the state\u2019s median household income is about $10,000 lower than the nation\u2019s as a whole, and its median hourly wage lags behind the nation\u2019s $16.87 (about $35,089 annually). There are also notable income gaps in the state; black households made just 59 percent of what white households did in 2013, while Alabama women made 76 cents for every dollar a man made.\n\nGriffith says the state\u2019s lower wages are a problem compared to the nation. He said he would work to establish a minimum wage in the state and index it to inflation, though he declined to quote a figure. Bentley says it\u2019s not a problem if the cost of living in the state is less than elsewhere.\n\n\u201cYou have to look to see how much it costs to live in Alabama,\u201d he said. \u201cThe taxes are lower, so many things are lower in the state of Alabama compared to other parts of the country.\u201d\n\nBoth candidates said they believe additional access to education would bring the state to parity on income.\n\nMedicaid\n\nFor Griffith, Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act is a necessity. For Bentley, it\u2019s an impossibility.\n\nMedicaid in Alabama is virtually impossible for most childless adults to access. Under the Affordable Care Act, the federal government would have extended the program to anyone making 138 percent of the poverty line \u2014 $16,104 for an individual; $32,913 for a family of four. However, in 2012 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled states could not be compelled to expand the program.\n\nGriffith, citing a 2012 UAB study on the issue, estimated that the expansion of Medicaid would bring $1 billion in new tax revenues, tens of thousands of jobs and cover about 300,000 Alabamians. The candidate says the expansion would not only improve health outcomes in the state, but make Alabama more attractive to companies seeking to locate here.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be in the top five for strokes and diabetes and have an employer come here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not extending Medicaid to cover these working Alabamians who are working for $7 or $8 an hour who cannot afford insurance. The Googles of the world, the Microsofts of the world, they would prefer a different environment to locate in.\u201d\n\nIn opposing expansion Bentley has cited his own opposition to the Affordable Care Act and his concerns about the expenses. The federal government would pay the full price of the expansion through 2017, and a gradually declining share afterwards, though never less than 90 percent.\n\nHowever, Bentley and other Republican lawmakers argue that even a 10 percent share on the cost is too much for the state\u2019s heavily burdened General Fund. More than a third of the General Fund pays for the state\u2019s Medicaid program.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not planning on expanding Medicaid,\u201d Bentley said. \u201cUnfortunately, Medicaid is expanding on its own, and the cost of Medicaid is expanding. Medicaid is really the albatross we have around our necks in this state.\u201d\n\nDespite the barriers to entrance, the program covers about 20 percent of the state. Asked if the poverty in the state was driving the growth, Bentley suggested people were being actively recruited to sign up for Medicaid.\n\n\u201cSomething is increasing the number of Medicaid patients,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd one of the things is signing people up, registering them to vote, telling people they\u2019re eligible for Medicaid.\u201d\n\nGriffith argues the expansion would ultimately generate enough new tax revenue to pay for the state\u2019s share. In terms of getting Medicaid cost under control, Bentley points to work being led by State Health Officer Don Williamson to establish regional care organizations are the state; Alabama is still waiting for a waiver from the federal government to allow the program to proceed.\n\nGeneral Fund\n\nMedicaid\u2019s cost growth is one of many challenges facing the state\u2019s General Fund budget, which pays for most noneducation funding in the state. Next year\u2019s General Fund, according to the Legislative Fiscal Office, faces a deficit of at least $200 million, a number that could easily grow.\n\nWith Bentley and majority Republicans consistently ruling out new taxes to shore up the budget, lawmakers are looking at cutting government still further \u2014 the state employee workforce has shrunk 11 percent in four years \u2014 and looking at closing the gap by eliminating outdated tax breaks.\n\nOther options could include reducing the percentage of revenues earmarked for specific purposes, or possible budget consolidation. However, Bentley said consolidation seemed least likely. \u201cI want to fight fights we can win,\u201d he said.\n\nGriffith said he supported moving some growth revenues into the General Fund, though he said he needed to study the situation further.\n\nBoth candidates said they would also be open to a gaming compact with the Poarch Band of Creek Indians to help alleviate the burden in the fund. It is not clear how much a compact would be worth to the state, but Bentley said it could be part of a broader solution to the budget deficit.\n\nBentley has consistently led Griffith in fundraising. Through Thursday, Bentley had raised $7.4 million and spent about $6.7 million; Griffith, whose funding has come almost entirely from personal loans and the Alabama Education Association, has raised $1.2 million and spent about $1.1 million.\n\nRobert Bentley\n\nAGE: 71\n\nOCCUPATION: Dermatologist\n\nPARTY:\n\nRepublican\n\nFAMILY: Wife, Dianne; four children, seven grandchildren.\n\nOFFICES HELD, OFFICES SOUGHT:\n\nRepublican nominee for Alabama Senate, 1998; Alabama House of Representatives, 2002-10; Governor of Alabama, 2011-present.\n\nParker Griffith\n\nAGE: 72\n\nOCCUPATION: Oncologist\n\nPARTY:\n\nDemocratic\n\nFAMILY:\n\nWife, Virginia; five children, 12 grandchildren.\n\nOFFICES HELD, OFFICES SOUGHT: Candidate for Mayor of Huntsville, 2004; Alabama State Senate, 2006-09; U.S. House of Representatives, 2009-11.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1wV2iQN", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Gubernatorial candidates clash over expanding program, but share some commong ground", "og": {"site_name": "The Montgomery Advertiser", "description": "Gubernatorial candidates clash over expanding program, but share some commong ground", "title": "Robert Bentley, Parker Griffith\u2019s divide: Medicaid", "url": "http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/local/alabama/2014/11/02/robert-bentley-parker-griffiths-divide-medicaid/18363837/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/montgomeryadvertiser.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Gubernatorial candidates clash over expanding program, but share some commong ground", "title": "Robert Bentley, Parker Griffith\u2019s divide: Medicaid", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b8235864cfb82420f51368a6691a6feb50f254f9/c=0-561-2526-3087&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Montgomery/2014/11/02/bentley04.jpg", "creator": "@mgmadvertiser", "site": "@mgmadvertiser", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=790279910", "fb": {"app_id": 163677993677689}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/southunionstreet"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "article_summary": "Griffith criticizes Bentley\u2019s performance on jobs, while Bentley expresses deep doubts over Griffith\u2019s assertions about Medicaid expansion and job creation.\nRobert Bentley and Democratic gubernatorial nominee Parker Griffith agree on more issues than they probably care to admit.\nOFFICES HELD, OFFICES SOUGHT: Candidate for Mayor of Huntsville, 2004; Alabama State Senate, 2006-09; U.S. House of Representatives, 2009-11.\nBentley has vociferously opposed expansion of Medicaid; Griffith has made the issue the centerpiece of his campaign.\nMedicaidFor Griffith, Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act is a necessity."}
