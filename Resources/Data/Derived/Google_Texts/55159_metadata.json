They used data from a new report that they commissioned from the Congressional Research Service to back up their claims.\n\nThis follows Rubio\u2019s successful effort to block the Obama Administration from being able to flow taxpayer funds into the \u201crisk corridors\u201d that were meant to help limit the amount of ObamaCare losses that insurance companies could wrack up.\n\nThese challenges matter. They get to the heart of whether ObamaCare can ever evolve into a more market-based scheme following some radical surgery. Or whether it will limp along as a public entitlement dependent upon mounting piles of subsidies.\n\nLearn more: 5 questions every presidential candidate should answer on health care\n\nOne of ObamaCare\u2019s fundamental flaws is its failure to make health insurance more affordable. Owing to reams of political-minded but costly regulations on what benefits need to be included (and how the insurance plans must be designed) the resulting plans end up being hollow but still expensive, pricing out many consumers.\n\nThe aim of the political left is to pump up the subsidies offered under ObamaCare, as a way to offset these costs and put ObamaCare into the reach of more consumers. Re-jiggering the risk sharing schemes that Rubio is targeting is a main part of this subsidization. Increasing subsidies is a key feature of Ms. Clinton\u2019s health plan.\n\nBy contrast, the consensus conservative proposal to replace ObamaCare envisions a more competitive market for coverage. It takes its cues from the benefits consumers\u2019 want and not the mandates that Washington decrees. The resulting plans won\u2019t have all of the same political bells and whistles as the ObamaCare. But more of the resulting plans would be affordable without heavy subsidies.\n\nLearn more: How Marco Rubio is quietly killing Obamacare\n\nBy peeling away these subsidies, Rubio is helping to force this reckoning. It\u2019s going to send a clear message to ObamaCare\u2019s many constituencies inside and outside industry: They need to get on board with reforming or replacing the scheme, rather than lobbying for subsidies to bail them out of the law\u2019s bloated enterprise.\n\nThe original Rubio provision called the Obama team\u2019s bluff after they falsely asserted that the \u201crisk corridors\u201d would be budget neutral. Their promise was that these provisions would only shift money away from profitable health plans to help cross-subsidize the plans that experienced greater losses. This is how the law was written. The White House argued that the risk corridors wouldn\u2019t skim extra money from the taxpayers. Then they sought to renege on that pledge.\n\nRubio\u2019s prior measure held the administration to the plain text of the law.\n\nNow Rubio is taking aim at another provision that\u2019s being similarly stretched as a way to subsidize ObamaCare\u2019s losses. His new letter concerns ObamaCare\u2019s \u201creinsurance\u201d program, designed to protect insurers against losses when they get their actuarial math wrong. Under the program, the feds collect money from profitable insurers and then redistribute it to health plans that end up enrolling more high-cost patients, and experience losses.\n\nObamaCare required that in its first year, the reinsurance program would collect $10 billion to reallocate to insurers. Another $2 billion would to go back to taxpayers. But not enough money was collected. So the Obama Administration, (through regulations) prioritized giving money to insurers over the $2 billion to the Treasury. This sleight of hand once again conflicted with the law\u2019s plain reading.\n\nLearn more: Marco Rubio is a new kind of Republican.

That text states that the $2 billion \u201cshall be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury of the United States and may not be used for the program established under this section.\u201d\n\nObamaCare\u2019s proponents want to subsidize their way out of the law\u2019s many woes, rather than reveal the law\u2019s structurally flawed features.
