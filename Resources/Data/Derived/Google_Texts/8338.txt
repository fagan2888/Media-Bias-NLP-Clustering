Art shows are a chance to show off creativity and hard work, but there is one metro show that offers a lot more than that.

At Hillcrest Mable Rose, an assisted living facility, music, photographs and paintings on the walls give visitors a glimpse into the lives of the people who live there.

“Overall, it’s a work that culminates over 12 months,” said Lisa Summers, administrator at Hillcrest Mable Rose.

Summers knows just how personal these art projects can be. She helps men and women with various forms of dementia create watercolor art.

“Through the years, you can see the decline with their disease and how it’s the same picture every year and now it’s kind of deteriorated,” Summers said.

The gallery is only a small part of the whole picture. The sketches, clothing and quilt art are just a few of the things on display.

For some, the art is personal, such as for the three daughters of Georgia Paskach who came to see the art show and their mother’s work.

“It’s a great honor,” said Karen Queen, one of Paskach’s daughters.

“It feels like home. You feel her presence,” said Cathy Pentagulio, another of Paskach’s daughters.

Paskach died five years ago, but her art still hangs at the assisted-living facility.

“I’m sure she would be very happy, very pleased,” the daughters said.

For the sisters, coming back is about supporting a community they love and for others. It is about getting to know the residents through their creativity.

“It’s kind of a testament to who they are and who they were,” Summers said.

This is the facility’s biggest event of the year and is in its eighth year. The hope is to continue the show again next year.
