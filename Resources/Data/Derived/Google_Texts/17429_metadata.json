Mick Mulvaney, a Republican congressman from South Carolina who has been critical of Operation Choke Point, disagrees that the CFPB\u2019s idea is \u201ccommon sense.\u201d\n\nHe told The Daily Signal in an exclusive interview, \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely absurd that the government would stick its nose in here.\u201d\n\n\u201cLenders do that already,\u201d he said of the requirement for lenders to ensure borrowers can pay back their loan. \u201cYou don\u2019t lend money to people that can\u2019t pay it back\u2014it\u2019s a surefire way to go out of business.\u201d\n\nBefore the final regulations are implemented, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will seek comment from a small business review panel and \u201ca wide range of stakeholders.\u201d\n\nSuch a public debate did not occur when the government implemented Operation Choke Point.\n\n>>> Read More: These 7 Emails Show Federal Officials Scheming to Target Legal Businesses\n\nWhat Is Operation Choke Point?\n\nOperation Choke Point was launched by the Justice Department in 2013 as a way to combat consumer fraud by working with multiple government agencies to discourage banks from doing business with \u201chigh risk\u201d industries.\n\nThe Justice Department, under Attorney General Eric Holder, carried out the program by partnering with federal banking regulators who could pressure banks from doing business with customers they considered \u201chigh risk.\u201d\n\nIn July 2013, Michael S. Blume, director of the Justice Department\u2019s Consumer Protection Branch, wrote a memo entitled, \u201cOperation Choke Point: Four-Month Status Report.\u201d\n\n\u201c[The Justice Department], through the Consumer Protection Branch, should take the lead in implementing this strategy,\u201d Blume wrote.\n\nPartner agencies should include the [Federal Trade Commission], [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation], [Office of the Comptroller of Currency], FinCEN (Treasury), Federal Reserve Banks, [National Association of Attorneys General], [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau], FBI, and [United States Postal Inspection Service]\u2014all of which are members of the President\u2019s Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force.\n\nWithout a bank to deposit checks, sponsor loans or process payments, companies are constrained from doing basic business.\n\n\u201cThe effects have been severe and drastic,\u201d said Jamie Fulmer of Advance America, which operates over 2,500 payday lending businesses in 29 different states.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen a number of banking relationships terminated and that severely restricts our ability to operate like any other business.\n\nUnder Operation Choke Point, Republicans allege the Justice Department didn\u2019t just target businesses committing illegal consumer fraud, but, also, entire industries.\n\nAmong them were gun dealers, ammunition manufactures, coin sellers\u2014and payday lenders.\n\n>>> Read More: More Gun Dealers Choked From Banking System\n\nThe Purpose of Payday Lenders\n\nPayday lenders primarily exist to serve people who can\u2019t get loans from banks. Lenders offer cash advances to people who run out of money between paychecks.\n\nThe cost of the loan is typically between $10 and $30 for every $100 borrowed, which amounts to almost a 400 percent annual percentage rate.\n\nCritics of the industry worry that borrowers will struggle to repay the loans, which will spiral into higher fees for the customer.\n\nIn Alabama, when Obama was endorsing his administration\u2019s regulations against payday lenders, he said, \u201cthere are four times as many payday lending stores as there are McDonald\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople go to payday lenders because they can\u2019t get quality loans at ordinary financial institutions,\u201d Mulvaney, who\u2019s spoken with payday lenders in his state who claim to have been victimized by Operation Choke Point, told The Daily Signal.\n\nA 2013 national survey by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which is one of the main agencies involved in carrying out Operation Choke Point, found that one in 13 U.S. households do not have bank accounts.\n\nIn the same report, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation found that 20 percent of U.S. households are underbanked, \u201cmeaning that they had a bank account but also used alternative financial services (AFS) outside of the banking system.\u201d\n\nMulvaney maintains the payday lending industry serves a \u201clegitimate need\u201d for unbanked and underbanked Americans.\n\n\u201cIf you set the same standards for payday lenders as you do for a regular financial institution, all you\u2019re going to do is simply drive these people into the shadows, to the loan sharks, and out of the banking system,\u201d he said. \u201cNot everybody likes payday, I get that, but it does serve a legitimate need in a legal manner.\u201d\n\nYet, Richard Cordray, the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which proposed the new regulations, believes consumers need protections against payday lenders.\n\n\u201cA consumer facing difficult financial circumstances is offered quick cash with no questions asked and in return agrees to provide access to a checking account or paycheck or vehicle title in order to get the loan,\u201d Cordray said at a March 26 hearing on payday lending. \u201cNo attempt is made to determine whether the consumer will be able to afford the ensuing payments\u2014only that the payments are likely to be collected.\u201d\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to protect consumers by enforcing federal consumer financial laws.\n\nDespite the skepticism facing the industry, payday lenders insist that they operate in accordance to the law\u2014and don\u2019t deserve to be driven out of business.\n\nChoking the Payday Lending Industry\n\nUnder the government\u2019s Operation Choke Point, a number of payday lending businesses lost access to their long-term bank accounts and were forced to downsize or close.\n\nAllison Deguisne, owner of Westshore Cash and Loan in Calif., was one of them.\n\n\u201cMy retirement is gone,\u201d she said last week before a congressional hearing on Operation Choke Point. \u201cIt\u2019s taken my life savings. I am out of business in the next couple weeks.\u201d\n\nDeguisne told reporters that after Wells Fargo choked off her line of credit, she\u2019s couldn\u2019t find another bank that would accept her business.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf we continue to shut down these industries, they won\u2019t have anywhere to go to get loans themselves,\u201d she said.\n\nAmy Cantu, Communications Director for the Community Financial Services Association of America, which represents the payday lending industry, told The Daily Signal via email that she\u2019s heard \u201cnumerous cases in our industry of businesses that are being unduly harmed by Operation Choke Point.\u201d\n\nEmails unearthed by congressional investigators suggest government officials have been secretly targeting the payday lending industry for years.\n\n\u201cI have never said this to you (but I am sincerely passionate about this) \u2026 but I literally cannot stand the payday lending industry,\u201d wrote Thomas Dujenski, the regional director of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to Mark Pearce, director of the Division of Depositor and Consumer Protection, in an email dated Nov. 26, 2012.\n\nIn another example, a senior Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation official insisted that the agency always mention pornography when discussing payday lenders among other \u201chigh risk\u201d industries during talking points in an effort to convey a \u201cgood picture regarding the unsavory nature of the businesses at issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating for us because we try to perform and carry out our business in a way that would give our banks confidence in all federal and state laws, but there\u2019s at least one federal agency that\u2019s de facto rule making that\u2019s limiting our access to the baking system without due process,\u201d said Fulmer of Advance America.\n\nFulmer said the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s proposed new rules \u201cappear to be a validation of that concern that we\u2019ve had all along,\u201d that the agency has been \u201cignoring facts,\u201d \u201cignoring research,\u201d and is being \u201clargely motivated and pressured by activist groups that seeks to end this credit option.\u201d\n\nBut at the end of the day, Fulmer is grateful that this time around, he has a chance to weigh in on what the government does to his industry.\n\n\u201cThe devil you know is better than the devil you don\u2019t know,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A government agency proposed new regulations on short-term lenders.
