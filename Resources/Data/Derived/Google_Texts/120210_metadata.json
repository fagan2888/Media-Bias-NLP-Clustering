Mark Udall and Rep. Cory Gardner skirmished over their visions for Colorado\u2019s economy during a prickly debate on Tuesday that featured aggressive attacks from both candidates.\n\nThe wide-ranging one-hour debate touched on women\u2019s issues, the Islamic State and the Second Amendment. But bickering about the economy \u2014 and intertwining issues like the Affordable Care Act, the Keystone XL pipeline, jobs reports and U.S. debt \u2014 dominated.\n\nGardner, who is challenging Udall for his U.S. Senate seat, broadly hammered the incumbent for backing a government-intensive approach to the economy. Udall, meanwhile, accused Gardner of hands-off policies that would ensure the middle class suffers while companies increase profits.\n\nUdall said the government should raise the minimum wage, pass the Paycheck Fairness Act that would largely ensure gender-pay equality, make college more affordable and create incentives for companies to keep jobs in the country.\n\n\u201cWhy do I bring this up? It\u2019s because Congressman Gardner has a different point of view on all of those issues,\u201d Udall said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t respond, we run the risk of the middle class not being the strong part of our society that it\u2019s always been.\u201d\n\nGardner countered that a more laissez-faire economic approach would benefit Colorado.\n\n\u201cIt is beyond time we got government out of the way and let America work,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must unleash the entrepreneurial spirit of this county.\u201d\n\nGardner attacked Udall\u2019s economic record with a bevy of statistics: that Coloradans are earning $4,000 less in median household income than they were several years ago, that the labor force participation rate is at its lowest percentage in 36 years and that Udall isn\u2019t firmly backing the construction of the Keystone pipeline, which Gardner said would bring thousands jobs that pay $20 to $30 an hour.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s happening under the failed leadership of Mark Udall,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cWe need more Colorado in Washington and less Washington in Colorado. Unfortunately our economy is stuck in reverse.\u201d\n\nUdall countered that Gardner was sour on the state.\n\n\u201cCongressman, you know I\u2019m never downbeat on Colorado,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot of challenges. We\u2019ve shown our mettle. I don\u2019t care what we\u2019ve been through, you don\u2019t talk down Colorado.\u201d\n\nThe debate was the pair\u2019s second of three this week. On Monday, they also sparred mostly over economic concerns, including financial issues related to climate change, carbon taxes and Medicaid.\n\nThe race is considered a toss-up with Gardner leading by 0.6 percentage points, according to poll averages.\n\nGardner not only tried to tie Udall to a still-sometimes stymied economy, he painted the senator as walking lockstep with President Barack Obama, whose policies and ratings have fallen with Americans.\n\n\u201cYou are tied \u2014 hook, line and sinker \u2014 to the president, who admitted that the two of you are together on the ballot,\u201d said Gardner, who repeated often that the president\u2019s policies are \u201cgoing to be on the ballot\u201d and that Udall shares Obama\u2019s stances.\n\nUdall didn\u2019t deny that he supported Obama on many issues \u2014 but he took pains to clarify that he backed any president, whether Obama or George W. Bush, if he thought the policy was sound. He also told Gardner to recall whose names will be on the ballot.\n\n\u201cI want to remind Congressman Gardner he\u2019s running against me, not Barack Obama \u2026 not Harry Reid,\u201d Udall said.\n\nBut Gardner didn\u2019t back off the comparison \u2014 saying that Reid, the Senate majority leader, was the No. 1 reason why Congress is dysfunctional and meandering.\n\nThe candidates were also asked how they\u2019d rein in U.S. debt that has ballooned to nearly $18 trillion. The debate turned immediately to the Affordable Care Act, which Udall supports and Gardner opposes.\n\n\u201cWe can start addressing the issue of our national debt by repealing Obamacare, which adds hundreds of billions of dollars in debt to our economy,\u201d Gardner said.\n\nThe representative said he would kill costly duplicative programs and make sure Congress spends within its own means. He also said he supports a balanced budget agreement \u2014 something he acknowledged that Udall supported but exempted large portions of spending from it.\n\n\u201cWe are spending money that future generations simply cannot handle,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will break our economy.\u201d\n\nUdall said Gardner\u2019s approach would put health care consumers at the mercy of insurance companies.\n\n\u201cYou heard Congressman Gardner say again he would repeal the Affordable Care Act. That would take us backward,\u201d Udall said, adding sarcastically: \u201cLet\u2019s put the insurance companies in charge. That would be a great day.\u201d\n\nHe accused Gardner of wanting to privatize Medicare and gut Social Security. Gardner denied those claims and, in a bit of back-and-forth, said it was Udall who had cut $800 billion from Medicare Advantage, a type of Medicare plan that\u2019s administered by private companies.\n\nBut Udall said those charges were misleading and that he redirected money, not cut it, to keep insurance companies from profiting: \u201cCongressman, it takes real gumption to stand up here and accuse me of cutting Medicare.\u201d\n\nDebate over climate change also seeped into their clashes over the economy.\n\nWhen the candidates were asked to merely provide a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer to a question, Gardner refused to say whether he believed humans were significantly responsible for climate change.\n\n\u201cThese are very important issues that cannot simply be described as \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no.\u2019 And that\u2019s why it\u2019s important that when it comes to things like our environment that we talk about how, yes, the climate is changing. But I disagree to the extent that man is causing it,\u201d Gardner said.\n\n\u201cI refuse to destroy our economy like Sen. Udall would in order to pursue some radical ideas,\u201d he continued.\n\nUdall said it\u2019s \u201cradical\u201d that Gardner denies humans largely cause climate change. The country, he argued, would benefit economically if it led the way on developing alternative fuels.\n\n\u201cWe seeing the effects (of climate change) in our farm economy and our ski industry,\u201d Udall said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to innovate and have new jobs.\u201d\n\nUdall and Gardner also addressed social and local issues on Tuesday \u2014 gun control legislation, Colorado\u2019s personhood amendment, their response to last year\u2019s massive flooding and illegal immigration, among others.\n\nUdall tried to lump Gardner\u2019s positions on birth control, gender pay and abortion into claims that Gardner doesn\u2019t support women. But the representative often maneuvered those efforts toward discussions about the economy. Likewise, Udall redirected any talk of President Obama back toward Gardner\u2019s positions on women.\n\nThe two will debate again on Thursday in Pueblo.\n\nGardner has represented Colorado\u2019s fourth U.S. House district since 2010. Udall was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2008 after serving the state\u2019s second congressional district from 1999 to 2009.\n\nMore Campaign 2014 Stories\n\nRep.
