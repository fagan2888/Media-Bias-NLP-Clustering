He lives in Washington.\n\nWASHINGTON\u2014 A Senate vote Thursday night to cripple President Obama\u2019s controversial health law faces a sure veto \u2013 both parties know that.\n\nBut they\u2019re each embracing the vote anyway as a way to show the stark divide between Democrats and Republicans as they head into the 2016 elections, including the critical Pennsylvania Senate race.\n\nSen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.), facing one of next year's toughest re-election fights, joined 51 other Republicans in passing a bill to eliminate key elements of the Affordable Care Act and stop federal aid to Planned Parenthood. The measure, which needed only a majority rather than the 60 votes usually needed in the Senate, passed 52-47, almost entirely on party lines (every Democrat and two Republicans voted \"no.\")\n\nBoth sides say the split shows why voters should trust them with the White House and control of the Senate next year.\n\n\u201cAfter losing their plans, losing their doctors, and being forced to pay sky-high deductibles and premiums, Pennsylvanians are bearing the burden of Obamacare\u2019s slow-motion collapse,\u201d Toomey said in a news release after the vote. \u201cTo protect the taxpayers and help Pennsylvanian families, I am pleased to vote to repeal Obamacare.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, however, hope to use the repeal plan in their own campaigns against Toomey and other vulnerable senators.\n\nBoth Katie McGinty and Joe Sestak, two of the three Democrats running to challenge Toomey, pointed to the roughly 430,000 Pennsylvanians who have gained health coverage under the Medicaid expansion included in the law.\n\n\u201cBetween his repeated votes to shut down the government and his attempts deny millions of Americans health care, Toomey has put obstructionism and partisan politics above Pennsylvanians,\u201d Sestak said in a news release.\n\nMcGinty, in a statement, said \u201cToomey threatens to take families back to the days when they were denied insurance because of lifetime caps or pre-existing conditions.\u201d She also blasted the cut to Planned Parenthood, saying the group saves lives across Pennsylvania and the country.\n\nBraddock Mayor John Fetterman, another Democrat in the race, has also supported the law.\n\nToomey campaign spokesman Steve Kelly said Friday that \u201cif Sestak and McGinty had their ways, we would have even more expensive government controlled healthcare.\"\n\nThe vote was largely political: the bill has no chance of becoming law while Obama is in office. But it was a reminder of the stakes in the next election, one that neither side seems likely to let voters forget.\n\nYou can follow Tamari on Twitter or email him at jtamari@phillynews.com.", "article_metadata": {"pubdate": 20160527, "editdate": "20151204T08:30:53", "twitter": {"title": "Toomey, Dems spar on Obamacare repeal", "url": "http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/capitolinq/Toomey-Dems-spar-on-Obamacare-repeal.html", "image": "http://media.philly.com/images/101515_toomey_1200.jpg", "creator": "@JonathanTamari", "site": "@phillydotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "cg": "news", "keywords": "Jonathan Tamari", "description": "WASHINGTON&mdash; A Senate vote Thursday night to cripple President Obama&rsquo;s controversial health law faces a sure veto &ndash; both parties know that. - Jonathan Tamari, Philadelphia Inquirer", "byline": "Jonathan Tamari", "contenttype": "Blog_Post", "publication": "Philadelphia Inquirer", "title": "Toomey, Dems spar on Obamacare repeal", "livedate": "20151204T08:30:53", "verify-v1": "3x82DC93LZlv0I/hQEBoyVVjlGPtX7VxHFgv1upr+9I=", "news_keywords": "Jonathan Tamari", "contentid": 360577371, "DC.date.issued": "2015-12-04T08:30:53-04:00", "fb": {"app_id": 938226082960499}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"site_name": "Philly.com", "description": "WASHINGTON&mdash; A Senate vote Thursday night to cripple President Obama&rsquo;s controversial health law faces a sure veto &ndash; both parties know that.", "title": "Toomey, Dems spar on Obamacare repeal", "url": "http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/capitolinq/Toomey-Dems-spar-on-Obamacare-repeal.html", "image": "http://media.philly.com/images/101515_toomey_1200.jpg", "type": "article"}, "searchdate": "2015-12-04", "google-site-verification": "db3T5L3C8_JvO-55gJ22lGGUnZLlNulgzTwX1NhCV3o", "y_key": "ccf0cd67e5f1e33c", "sourcepublication": "Inquirer"}, "article_summary": "WASHINGTON\u2014 A Senate vote Thursday night to cripple President Obama\u2019s controversial health law faces a sure veto \u2013 both parties know that.\n\u201cTo protect the taxpayers and help Pennsylvanian families, I am pleased to vote to repeal Obamacare.\u201dDemocrats, however, hope to use the repeal plan in their own campaigns against Toomey and other vulnerable senators.\nToomey campaign spokesman Steve Kelly said Friday that \u201cif Sestak and McGinty had their ways, we would have even more expensive government controlled healthcare.\"\n\u201cBetween his repeated votes to shut down the government and his attempts deny millions of Americans health care, Toomey has put obstructionism and partisan politics above Pennsylvanians,\u201d Sestak said in a news release.\nBefore that he worked in Trenton, reporting on the characters and color of New Jersey state government."}
