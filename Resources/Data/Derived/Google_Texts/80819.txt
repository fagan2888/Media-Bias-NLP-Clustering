As tweeted out by far left magazine Mother Jones , this photo is really going to have Putin trembling in his boots.

Yesterday saw an Obama trifecta of foolishness. Not only did the President deliver a weak response and declared a “Happy Hour,” as Vladimir Putin sent 2000 troops into Ukraine, he reverted to his penchant for taking selfie photos, this time with Bill Nye, the Science Guy, who has been doing yeoman duty defending the manmade global warming theory that has been on an embarrassing and unpredicted “pause” and Neil deGrasse Tyson, astrophysicist and foirmer PBS science serius host.

The selfie has become a symbol of the Obama presidency, representing a self-obsessed egotist (he uses the personal pronoun more frequently than any politician I can remember) with little sense of appropriateness or gravitas.
