In Florida, the use of directional signals is mandatory even when not turning.

On cars purchased in Massachusetts, however, turn signals are optional equipment. Nevah use ’em — why pay for ’em?

It’s high time that The Style Invitational furthered its mission to unenlighten the reading public with a contest seeking totally bogus trivia. This week, on the suggestion of 377-time Loser Jeff Contompasis (rhymes with “quantum gases”): Send us some fictoids about cars and trucks and driving and stuff, like the examples above, which Jeff wrote for our Week 998 contest for fictitious laws.

Winner gets the Inkin’ Memorial, the Lincoln statue bobblehead that is the official Style Invitational trophy. Second place receives “Heads of State,” by Carl Sferazza Anthony (back when he was a Washington Post researcher, his latter two names were transposed). This nifty book depicts such fabulous artifacts as a screaming-green Richard Nixon Head candle, a Herbert Hoover Head lemonade pitcher (the head is lopped off at the top for easy access); and a George W. Bush Head jack-in-the-box, from which W pops out complete with lectern. We’d love to offer a few of these heads ourselves, but our second-prize budget is zero. So we thank Loser Pie Snelson for donating the book, at least.

Other runners-up win their choice of a yearned-for Loser Mug or the ardently desired “Whole Fools” Grossery Bag. Honorable mentions get a lusted-after Loser magnet, either the Po’ Wit Laureate or Puns of Steel. First Offenders receive a smelly tree-shaped air “freshener” (FirStink for their first ink). E-mail entries to losers@washpost.com or, if you were born in the 19th century, fax to 202-334-4312. Deadline is Monday, June 16; results published July 6 (online July 3). No more than 25 entries per entrant per contest. Include “Week 1075” in your e-mail subject line or it might be ignored as spam. Include your real name, postal address and phone number with your entry. See contest rules and guidelines at wapo.st/InvRules. This week’s honorable-mentions subhead is by Jeff Contompasis; the alternative headline in the “Next week’s results” line is by Chris Doyle.

You can get a Nixon candle on eBay, but this week’s second-prize winner gets a picture of one (but so much more!). ( / Bloomsbury Books, 2004)

REPORT FROM WEEK 1071: THREE ON A MATCH

In Week 1071, the Empress sent people to a Web site containing a huge list of three-letter abbreviations, from AAA to DZZ. Each of them links to a list of things that those three letters stand for. The contest was to choose any two or three of those things and compare or contrast them.

THE WINNER OF THE INKIN’ MEMORIAL
