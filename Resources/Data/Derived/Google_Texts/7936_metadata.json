The candidate himself has attempted to dismiss questions about his eligibility as trivial. During the most recent Republican debate, Fox News\u2019 Neil Cavuto asked Cruz whether his Canadian birth might disqualify him from the presidency on constitutional grounds. Cruz seemed unfazed. \u201cWell, Neil, I am glad we are focused on the important topics of the evening,\u201d he responded to laughter and applause.\n\nCruz went on to argue that because he is the child of a U.S. citizen, he qualifies as natural born, and claimed that legal scholarship was firmly on his side. Donald Trump, who is largely responsible for the attention being drawn to the issue, cited Harvard Law professor Laurence Tribe as a prominent dissenter. Yet even Trump seemed aware that his gripes came off as childish and petty. \u201cThis isn\u2019t me saying it. I don\u2019t care. I think I\u2019m going to win fair and square,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact is there\u2019s a big overhang. There\u2019s a big question on your head. And you can\u2019t do that to the party.\u201d And what is Donald Trump if not a self-sacrificing, humble servant to the best interests of the Republican Party?\n\nTrump\u2019s characterization of Tribe\u2019s argument was, unsurprisingly, overly simplistic. Contrary to his insistence, Tribe does not argue that the natural born clause of the Constitution renders Cruz ineligible, but rather uses the issue to draw attention to the absurdity of Cruz\u2019s judicial philosophy. \u201cThe kind of judge Cruz says he admires and would appoint to the Supreme Court is an \u2018originalist,\u2019\u201d Tribe writes in the Boston Globe, \u201cone who claims to be bound by the narrowly historical meaning of the Constitution\u2019s terms at the time of their adoption. To his kind of judge, Cruz ironically wouldn\u2019t be eligible, because the legal principles that prevailed in the 1780s and \u201990s required that someone actually be born on US soil to be a \u2018natural born\u2019 citizen.\u201d\n\nTribe goes on to advocate for an entirely different approach. \u201cThe kind of judge I admire and Cruz abhors is a \u2018living constitutionalist,\u2019 one who believes that the Constitution\u2019s meaning evolves with the perceived needs of the time and longstanding practice,\u201d he writes. \u201cTo that kind of judge, Cruz would be eligible to serve because it no longer makes sense to be bound by the narrow historical definition that would disqualify him.\u201d\n\nThe widespread reluctance to take up this cause raises the question of whether the natural born citizen requirement is, itself, outdated. The ambiguity of the term, the fact that its definition remains unsettled even among legal scholars, only serves to bolster the position that the rule is arcane. According to Tribe, the \u201cnarrow definition\u201d of what deemed one a \u201cnatural born citizen\u201d was born out of \u201c18th-century fears of a tyrannical takeover of our nation by someone loyal to a foreign power \u2014 fears that no longer make sense.\u201d\n\nYet it is unclear why these fears are, categorically, more reasonable as they pertain to, say, a naturalized citizen whose family moved to the United States when she was an infant. Or one who came to this country as a young student, with the hopes of providing his natural born citizen children with opportunities he never had. I don\u2019t deny that broadening the field of eligible candidates for the presidency would raise complicated questions about cultural assimilation and, perhaps, loyalty. But such questions ought to be settled by the democratic process, by an electorate that determines who has the best interests of party and country at heart, rather than by a technicality that relies upon accident of birth.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The left's giddy schadenfreude over Cruz's eligibility only legitimizes Donald Trump's brand of knee-jerk hate", "title": "Don\u2019t be a Ted Cruz birther: Liberals should reject the xenophobia behind \u201cnatural born\u201d citizenship", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The left's giddy schadenfreude over Cruz's eligibility only legitimizes Donald Trump's brand of knee-jerk hate", "title": "Don\u2019t be a Ted Cruz birther: Liberals should reject the xenophobia behind \u201cnatural born\u201d citizenship", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/24/dont_be_a_ted_cruz_birther_liberals_should_reject_the_ugly_xenophobia_behind_natural_born_citizenship/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/ted_cruz28.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The left's giddy schadenfreude over Cruz's eligibility only legitimizes Donald Trump's brand of knee-jerk hate", "title": "Don\u2019t be a Ted Cruz birther: Liberals should reject the xenophobia behind \u201cnatural born\u201d citizenship", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/ted_cruz28.jpg", "creator": "@silpakov", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Silpa Kovvali", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 presidential election, birtherism, Birthers, Citizenship, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Xenophobia", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: 2016 presidential election, birtherism, Birthers, Citizenship, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Xenophobia, Life News, Politics NewsThe debate about whether Ted Cruz is a \u201cnatural born citizen\u201d rages on, seemingly in spite of itself.\nOr one who came to this country as a young student, with the hopes of providing his natural born citizen children with opportunities he never had.\nCruz went on to argue that because he is the child of a U.S. citizen, he qualifies as natural born, and claimed that legal scholarship was firmly on his side.\nContrary to his insistence, Tribe does not argue that the natural born clause of the Constitution renders Cruz ineligible, but rather uses the issue to draw attention to the absurdity of Cruz\u2019s judicial philosophy.\nI don\u2019t deny that broadening the field of eligible candidates for the presidency would raise complicated questions about cultural assimilation and, perhaps, loyalty."}
