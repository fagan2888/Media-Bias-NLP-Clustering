The Affordable Care Act's online health insurance marketplaces for small businesses launched Monday in Illinois and four other states, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.

Small businesses in Illinois — as well as Delaware, Missouri, New Jersey and Ohio — will get a chance to pre-enroll in the Small Business Health Options Program, or SHOP, but won't be able to see or select plans until the Affordable Care Act begins open enrollment Nov. 15.

The SHOP exchange allows employers with 50 or fewer full-time employees to compare and buy commercial health insurance plans for workers.

By rolling out the online marketplace early in five states, the federal government hopes to avoid the types of problems it encountered last year when HealthCare.gov crashed and remained largely out of commission for the first two months of open enrollment.

Brokers and health insurance agents will also be able to pre-enroll, helping the government test new online features, such as:

•Establishing an account

•Assigning an agent or broker to the account

•Completing an employer eligibility application

•Obtaining an eligibility determination

•Uploading an employee roster.

The business owners, brokers and health insurance agents will give feedback before the site goes live to the public. Open enrollment on public exchanges runs from Nov. 15 to Feb. 15.
