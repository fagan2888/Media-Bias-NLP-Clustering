A few minutes later it appeared, speeding along Lay Dam Road past what used to be Clanton Medical Center to parts unknown.\n\nA year ago, the ambulance might have stopped here. But now the former Clanton Medical Center is just an empty shell, with ceiling tiles ripped out and trash bins lining empty hallways, as the building owner tries to prepare for its next life.\n\nBudget woes forced the hospital\u2019s clo\u00adsure last fall in a scenario that\u2019s been seen across Alabama. Rural counties have been losing health care facilities and services for years, a flow fueled by dwindling popula\u00adtions and patients that leave a gap between the cost of services and reimbursements from Medicaid and insurers.\n\nVast changes are expected in the way Americans across the country go to the doctor as the rollout of the Affordable Care Act begins Oct.1. But before that happens, it\u2019s important to understand the state of health care in Alabama now.\n\nWhile the state\u2019s major cities have world-class facilities, with new buildings and internationally known physicians and researchers, they\u2019re often just a short drive away from rural counties that don\u2019t have many basic services. Eight of them have no hospital at all.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t live in one of those counties you should care, said Dale Quin\u00adney, executive director of the Alabama Rural Health Association.\n\n\u201cMost tangible things are produced in a rural area or produced using resources from a rural area,\u201d he said. \u201cOur rural areas are critical to the survival of everyone, regardless of where you live.\u201d\n\nQuinney\u2019s agency says 55 of the state\u2019s 67 counties are considered rural, and data shows those residents are far less healthy than their urban peers. Rural residents are generally poorer, older and less for\u00admally educated \u2014 all factors that contrib\u00adute to the health trends.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe population can ill afford to go without basic services, yet many communities don\u2019t even have baby delivery. Consider that in 1980, 46 rural counties had hospitals that provided obstetrical services. By this year, however, that number had fallen to 18. For a woman living in southeastern Ala\u00adbama\u2019s Barbour County, that means travel\u00ading across two county lines to hospitals in Dothan for delivery, which 77 percent of new moms do, Quinney said. That\u2019s at least a 55-mile drive from the Barbour County seat of Clayton. Likewise, Randolph County women make a long trek to give birth. Nearly half of them head north to Calhoun County or south to Chambers County, while the rest travel to Tallapoosa County or leave the state for a hospital in Georgia. When hospitals don\u2019t deliver babies many families in those communities bypass their local hospital even if it does provide other services they need, Quin\u00adney said. \u201cThat invisible bond between families and their local hospitals is being lost,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother issue is dialysis services,which 16 counties lack. And in those counties, there are more than 500 dialysis patients. This is important, Quinney said, because dialysis is a time-consuming process that can take up to eight hours a day, three days a week. That means extensive travel for patients who don\u2019t have a clinic nearby. In Clanton, there are plans in the works to improve the county\u2019s health care offer\u00adings, including a new hospital. The Chil\u00adton County Hospital Board announced a plan to build a new hospital there, using the proceeds of a proposed one-cent county\u00adwide sales tax. St. Vincent\u2019s Health System would manage the facility. But it is not yet a done deal. The sales tax must first win approval from the Ala\u00adbama Legislature and then residents in a vote on the measure, said Fred Craw\u00adford, economic developer for the Chilton County Industrial Development Board. In the near term, an urgent care center has been recruited to take over part of the vacant space in the former hospital, Craw\u00adford added. It is expected to open at the beginning of next year. The hospital build\u00ading\u2019s owners are looking to fill the rest of the space with more health care vendors, in hopes of creating a medical mall.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, healthcare reform, news", "title": "Why Alabama's rural counties are at risk as Obamacare approaches", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Why Alabama\\u0027s rural counties are at risk as Obamacare approaches\", \"link\": \"http://blog.al.com/wire/2013/09/alabamas_rural_counties_at_risk_healthcare.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/wire/photo/13459194-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11295939\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-09-23T20:47:28Z\", \"author\": \"Dawn Kent Azok | dazok@al.com\", \"tags\": [\"@river-all\",\"Affordable Care Act\",\"healthcare reform\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/wire/photo/13459194-standard.jpg", "creator": "@Dawn_Kent", "site": "@aldotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Eight Alabama counties have no hospital at all, while many more lack basic services such as baby delivery."}, "article_date_updated": "Monday, September 23, 2013,  4:10 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.al.com/wire/photo/clanton-hospital-1jpg-32fcfdcf2965f097.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"dkent\", \"author_nickname\": \"Dawn Kent Azok | dazok@al.com\", \"author_id\": \"4511\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Retired: Real-Time News from AL.com\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://blog.al.com/wire/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "Eight Alabama counties have no hospital at all, while many more lack basic services such as baby delivery.", "title": "Why Alabama's rural counties are at risk as Obamacare approaches", "url": "http://blog.al.com/wire/2013/09/alabamas_rural_counties_at_risk_healthcare.html", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/wire/photo/13459194-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "AL.com", "article": {"author": "http://"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Monday, September 23, 2013,  3:45 PM", "article_author": "Dawn Kent Azok | dazok@al.com", "Description": "Eight Alabama counties have no hospital at all, while many more lack basic services such as baby delivery."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe323b\"", "article_summary": "Even if you don\u2019t live in one of those counties you should care, said Dale Quin\u00adney, executive director of the Alabama Rural Health Association.\nConsider that in 1980, 46 rural counties had hospitals that provided obstetrical services.\nThe Chil\u00adton County Hospital Board announced a plan to build a new hospital there, using the proceeds of a proposed one-cent county\u00adwide sales tax.\nBut before that happens, it\u2019s important to understand the state of health care in Alabama now.\nRural counties have been losing health care facilities and services for years, a flow fueled by dwindling popula\u00adtions and patients that leave a gap between the cost of services and reimbursements from Medicaid and insurers."}
