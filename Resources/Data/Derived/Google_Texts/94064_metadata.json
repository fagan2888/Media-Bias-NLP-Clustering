Todd Young to face Democrat and former U.S. Rep. Baron Hill in the race for Indiana\u2019s open senate seat this November.\n\nYoung was off to an early lead when the polls closed at 6 p.m. As supporters started to flow into the room for Young\u2019s victory party in downtown Indianapolis, so did the votes. The race was called for a Young victory just after 7 p.m.\n\n\u201cWe would win because from the get-go we knew this would be a team effort,\u201d said Young. \u201cWell, we did win today, and it\u2019s because of all of you who worked to advance conservative principles in this primary election.\u201d\n\nYoung said his opponent, U.S. Rep. Marlin Stutzman, earned respect and was a strong opponent. Stutzman called Tuesday a tough night.\n\n\u201cI wanted to come down and say I called Todd Young and wished him the very best,\u201d said Stutzman.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the turnout we wanted at all,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen looking at both candidates, the two often have similar positions. Both are anti-abortion. Both criticize President Barack Obama. Both oppose Obamacare. Both have A+ ratings with the National Rifle Association. They even both joined Congress at the same time in 2010. And both claimed to be the true conservative in the race.\n\nBut the race became tense from the start. In February, the Stutzman campaign, along with the Indiana Democratic Party, challenged Young\u2019s eligibility to be on the ballot. The state requires 500 signatures from each congressional district for someone to enter the race, but Stutzman and the Democrats argued Young fell short of the number required. A hand count of the paper petitions by TheStatehouseFile.com and several other media organizations found 497 signatures. In the end, the Indiana Elections Commission had a split decision on the discrepancy, which kept Young on the ballot.\n\nYoung, however, is ready to move on from the primary. He said he is confident he can unite the Republican Party, and keep the Senate seat, being vacated by retiring U.S. Sen. Dan Coats, in Republican hands by defeating Hill.\n\n\u201cI know all of you are ready for the fight. And to those Hoosiers who didn\u2019t vote for us today\u2014know that we share the same common sense conservative principles and I will work to earn your trust and support,\u201d said Young.\n\nThe race in November will be a rematch. Hill lost his re-election to the U.S. 9th Congressional District to Young in 2010. In a statement, Hill said he\u2019s looking forward to a \u201cvigorous campaign.\u201d\n\nDuring the election party, Young gave his team Wednesday off and said he will take some time with his wife and kids, but he, too, is preparing for a fight.\n\n\u201cBaron\u2019s record hasn\u2019t changed. My principles haven\u2019t changed,\u201d said Young. \u201cAnd so I just look forward to the coming months and I expect, you know, as long as we continue to go out there, tell the truth, and run on our record we will win in November.\u201d\n\nAdrianna Pitrelli and Max Bomber are reporters for TheStatehouseFile.com a news website powered by Franklin College students.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.2"}, "article_summary": "By Max Bomber and Adrianna PitrelliTheStatehouseFile.comINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Republicans are sending U.S. Rep.
