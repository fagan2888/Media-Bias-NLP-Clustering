Here are 5:\n\nBiofuels. Swinburne PhD student Avinash Karpe has found a way to break down the waste with the help of various fungi by generating enzymes. The enzymes convert the waste into soluble sugars \u2013 which can be converted into ethanol and other biofuels. \u201cThis fermentation process takes one to three weeks and produces alcohols, acids and simple sugars of industrial and medicinal interest,\u201d he said.\n\nSkin care products. Keracol, a company formed by The University of Leeds in the U.K., has partnered with Marks & Spencer to create a natural skincare regimen using the waste products of grapes. Keracol came up with a new way to extract resveratrol, a natural molecule found in the outer skins of red grapes. Resveratrol is a well-known antioxidant with protective anti-aging properties.\n\nRelated: California\u2019s Napa Valley Earthquake by the Numbers\n\nNutritional supplements and food preservatives. By grounding muscadine grape skin and seeds into a powder and soaking that powder in a solution of enzymes, researchers at the University of Florida are improving the antioxidant activity of the waste and creating nutritional supplements. Skin and seed extract from muscadine grapes can also be used as natural food preservatives, they found.\n\nGluten-free flour substitutes. A sister company of California winemaker Kendall-Jackson has partnered with a local miller to produce flour, which comes in 16 varieties based on the different wine grapes used to make it, NPR reported last year. These different flours can be used for everything from cabernet brownies to violet-colored pasta.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The U.S. became the world\u2019s biggest market for wine last year, but most of us are likely unaware that large amounts of waste comes out of making wine and that winery waste can be used for several other consumer goods.", "title": "5 Surprising Products Based on Winery Waste", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/23/5-Surprising-Products-Based-Winery-Waste", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02232012_Wine_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/23/5-Surprising-Products-Based-Winery-Waste", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02232012_Wine_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The U.S. became the world\u2019s biggest market for wine last year, but most of us are likely unaware that large amounts of waste comes out of making wine and that winery waste can be used for several other consumer goods.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde688\"", "article_summary": "Related: U.S. Surpasses France As Biggest Wine MarketThis waste has limited use as animal feed because of its poor nutrient value and digestibility, unlike other agricultural byproducts \u2013 and wine waste doesn\u2019t work as compost because it doesn\u2019t degrade, \u201cso a majority of this grape waste ends up as toxic landfill.\u201dIn recent years, however, researchers have found ways to use winery waste for consumer purposes.\nA sister company of California winemaker Kendall-Jackson has partnered with a local miller to produce flour, which comes in 16 varieties based on the different wine grapes used to make it, NPR reported last year.\nThe enzymes convert the waste into soluble sugars \u2013 which can be converted into ethanol and other biofuels.\nKeracol, a company formed by The University of Leeds in the U.K., has partnered with Marks & Spencer to create a natural skincare regimen using the waste products of grapes.\nSwinburne PhD student Avinash Karpe has found a way to break down the waste with the help of various fungi by generating enzymes."}
