Ben Sasse, R-Nebr., said today in testimony before a House subcommittee.\n\nThe co-ops, nonprofit insurance companies, were created under the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, to sell insurance plans to consumers seeking health coverage.\n\nSo far, 11 of the original 23 co-ops have failed. An additional co-op in Vermont dissolved before enrolling anyone.\n\n\u201cThe tumultuous failure of the ACA\u2019s co-ops began in my own backyard,\u201d Sasse said in his testimony before the oversight and investigations subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nCoOportunity Health, which operated in Iowa and Nebraska, was the first co-op to fail, he noted. It cost taxpayers $145.3 million.\n\nSasse said the failure of CoOportunity was \u201ca terrible midyear shock\u201d to enrollees that created \u201cuncertainty and fear\u201d for those families.\n\n\u201cSo why did CoOportunity fail?\u201d Sasse asked. \u201cCuriously, nine months later, we don\u2019t really have any answers.\u201d\n\nHe said \u201cthe lack of transparency has been terribly disappointing,\u201d and that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency that oversees Obamacare, must take responsibility.\n\n\u201cConsumers who face coverage disruption and the taxpayers who footed this bill deserve answers,\u201d Sasse said, adding that the agency \u201cneeds to provide a complete accounting of what has gone wrong within this program.\u201d\n\nHe added:\n\nI started asking questions right after CoOportunity failed in my state in May, without receiving a sufficient response to my questions, I asked more questions, when a second co-op, Louisiana, failed. \u2026 These are good governance [questions], not partisan questions. I was a fierce opponent of the Affordable Care Act, and I know many of you in this room are, might be, strong supporters of the ACA, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what your hearing is about today. I think this is about getting to the bottom of what\u2019s actually going on and why so many of our neighbors are losing their health care coverage.\u201d\n\nSasse called CoOportunity\u2019s demise the first in a series of dominoes to fall.\n\n\u201cIt is an urgent problem that has left hundreds of thousands of Americans scrambling to find new plans this fall,\u201d the Nebraska Republican said.\n\nHe said two things are known about the failure of the co-ops:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
