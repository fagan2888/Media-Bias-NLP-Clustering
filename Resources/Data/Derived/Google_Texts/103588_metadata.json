China says it must sign off on the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, who fled into exile in 1959 after a failed uprising.\n\n\u201cEven if China tries to select the next Dalai Lama, the Tibetans will continue to have an elected leader who is outside the Communist Party\u2019s grip,\u201d said P.D. Mukherji, professor of Chinese studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi.\n\nThe contest will decide who leads the parliament of the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) in Dharamsala, a town in India\u2019s Himalayan foothills where a community of Tibetans lives in exile with the Dalai Lama.\n\n\u201cChina will see that CTA is going to stay here for a long time and the Tibetan freedom struggle will be here for a long time,\u201d incumbent Lobsang Sangay, who is seeking re-election, told Reuters.\n\nExiled Tibetans consider the CTA to be their legitimate government, but no country recognizes it. China has lobbied to sideline the Dalai Lama from the international circuit, although he did address an audience in Geneva last week despite those efforts.\n\nFREEDOM STRUGGLE\n\nThe elected leader will have to rally global support for Tibet\u2019s campaign for freedom, strengthen ties with India and discourage self-immolation by refugees when protesting against Beijing\u2019s ironclad control of the Himalayan region.\n\nThis month, a Tibetan schoolboy died in India after setting himself on fire to protest against Chinese rule in Tibet.\n\nSangay and his opponent, Penpa Tsering, both favour the \u201cmiddle way\u201d propagated by the Dalai Lama for more than 50 years that advocates non-violence while seeking autonomy for Tibet.\n\nRepresentatives of the Dalai Lama held several rounds of talks with China up to 2010, but formal dialogue stalled amid leadership changes in Beijing and a security crackdown in Tibet.\n\nOne candidate who called for independence from China lost in preliminary elections held in 2015, as voters felt that opposition to Beijing would only undercut international support for, and weaken the economic condition of, exiled Tibetans.\n\nAsked to comment on the leadership election, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Beijing did not recognize the \u201cso-called government in exile\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe hope that any country, especially those which want to have good relations with China, (does) not provide any convenience or platform to any so-called Tibet independence activities of anti-China separatists,\u201d Lu told a news briefing.\n\n(Reporting by Abhishek Madhukar and Rupam Jain)\n\nRNS TOP STORIES:\n\nMissouri Christian wears hijab in solidarity\n\nNo, Pope Francis didn\u2019t exactly fire his ambassador to US \u2014 yet\n\nMormon \u2018gospel art\u2019: Kitsch or classic?", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Beijing, Buddhism, China, CTA, Dalai Lama, Dharamsala, India, Sikyong, Tibet", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "DHARAMSALA/NEW DELHI -- The second election of its kind follows a decision by the 80-year-old Nobel Peace Laureate to relinquish his political authority.", "title": "Exiled Tibetans to elect leader to sustain Dalai Lama legacy", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2016/03/18/exiled-tibetans-elect-dalai-lama-legacy/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-18T031338Z_1863698150_GF10000348768_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-TIBET-ELECTION-e1458303226910.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2016/03/18/exiled-tibetans-elect-dalai-lama-legacy/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2016/03/18/exiled-tibetans-elect-dalai-lama-legacy/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "DHARAMSALA/NEW DELHI -- The second election of its kind follows a decision by the 80-year-old Nobel Peace Laureate to relinquish his political authority."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1d02\"", "article_summary": "\u201cEven if China tries to select the next Dalai Lama, the Tibetans will continue to have an elected leader who is outside the Communist Party\u2019s grip,\u201d said P.D.\nChina says it must sign off on the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, who fled into exile in 1959 after a failed uprising.\nSangay and his opponent, Penpa Tsering, both favour the \u201cmiddle way\u201d propagated by the Dalai Lama for more than 50 years that advocates non-violence while seeking autonomy for Tibet.\nChina has lobbied to sideline the Dalai Lama from the international circuit, although he did address an audience in Geneva last week despite those efforts.\nDHARAMSALA/NEW DELHI \u2014 Tens of thousands of exiled Tibetans across India and overseas will vote on Sunday to elect a political leader, hoping the democratic exercise will help sustain their struggle to secure complete autonomy for Chinese-ruled Tibet."}
