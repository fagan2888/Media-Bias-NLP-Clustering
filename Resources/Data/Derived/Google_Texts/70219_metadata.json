Communal violence had erupted in Yakutpura, Panjrapole, Fatehpura and Kumbharvada in the city on Thursday after some alleged derogatory posts about a religion were put on social networking site Facebook.\n\nOn Friday, some minor incidents were reported with police lobbying teargas shells to disperse two rival groups who pelted each other with stones in Yakutpura, Panjrapole, Fatehpura, Kumbharvada and other areas in the walled city. The situation remained normal during the day yesterday, but a stabbing incident was reported from Jagmalni Pole area last night, Vadodara City Joint Police Commissioner D J Patel said today.\n\nFollowing the attack, sporadic incidents of stone throwing took place in Panigate, Wadi, Memon Colony, Ajwa Road and Navapura areas of the city, he said.\n\nPolice had to lob teargas shells and open fire in the air in these areas. No one was injured in the action, he said. \"With the arrival of two more State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) companies, the total number of its companies deployed in the city has gone up to 13. Besides, one company each of RAF, CRPF and BSF have also been deployed,\" Patel said.\n\nSenior police officials rushed to the affected areas and brought the situation under control. They maintained a vigil in the trouble-torn areas till the wee hours today. Nearly 100 miscreants have been rounded up so far from the violence-hit areas, he said.\n\nYesterday, mobile internet facility in the city was suspended as a precautionary measure to check the spread of rumours which could spark communal tension.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Communal clashes in Vadodara: Security stepped up after fresh violence erupts - Security has been heightened with two more SRPF companies being deployed following fresh violence reported from one of the city areas where communal clashes occurred over the last three days, police said today.\u00a0Communal violence had erupted in Yakutpura, Panjrapole, Fatehpura and Kumbharvada in the city on Thursday after some alleged derogatory posts about a religion were put on social networking site Facebook.", "copyright": "Diligent Media Corporation Ltd.", "og": {"site_name": "dna", "description": "Communal clashes in Vadodara: Security stepped up after fresh violence erupts - Security has been heightened with two more SRPF companies being deployed following fresh violence reported from one of the city areas where communal clashes occurred over the last three days, police said today.\u00a0Communal violence had erupted in Yakutpura, Panjrapole, Fatehpura and Kumbharvada in the city on Thursday after some alleged derogatory posts about a religion were put on social networking site Facebook.", "title": "Communal clashes in Vadodara: Security stepped up after fresh violence erupts | Latest News & Updates at Daily News & Analysis", "url": "http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-communal-clashes-in-vadodara-security-stepped-up-after-fresh-violence-erupts-2022128", "image": "http://static.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/2014/09/28/270951-vadodara-clashes-pti.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-28T13:05:00+05:30", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Security has been heightened with two more SRPF companies being deployed following fresh violence reported from one of the city areas where communal clashes occurred over the last three days, police said today.\u00a0Communal violence had erupted in Yakutpura, Panjrapole, Fatehpura and Kumbharvada in the city on Thursday after some alleged derogatory posts about a religion were put on social networking site Facebook.", "title": "Communal clashes in Vadodara: Security stepped up after fresh violence erupts", "url": "http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-communal-clashes-in-vadodara-security-stepped-up-after-fresh-violence-erupts-2022128", "image": {"width": 187, "height": 92}, "creator": "@dna", "site": "@dna", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 1474930936151793}, "keywords": "communal tension, Communal Violence, State Reserve police force (SRPF), Vadodara, Yakutpura, Facebook, Wadi, BSF, Kumbharvada, Vadodara City Joint Police Commissioner D, Panigate, CRPF, RAF, Memon Colony, Fatehpura, Ajwa Road, State Reserve Police Force, Jagmalni Pole, Navapura, J Patel", "article": {"section": "India", "tag": "communal tension, Communal Violence, State Reserve police force (SRPF), Vadodara, Yakutpura, Facebook, Wadi, BSF, Kumbharvada, Vadodara City Joint Police Commissioner D, Panigate, CRPF, RAF, Memon Colony, Fatehpura, Ajwa Road, State Reserve Police Force, Jagmalni Pole, Navapura, J Patel", "published_time": "2014-09-28T13:05:00+05:30"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "communal tension, Communal Violence, State Reserve police force (SRPF), Vadodara, Yakutpura, Facebook, Wadi, BSF, Kumbharvada, Vadodara City Joint Police Commissioner D, Panigate, CRPF, RAF, Memon Colony, Fatehpura, Ajwa Road, State Reserve Police Force, Jagmalni Pole, Navapura, J Patel"}, "article_summary": "Security has been heightened with two more SRPF companies being deployed following fresh violence reported from one of the city areas where communal clashes occurred over the last three days, police said today.\nCommunal violence had erupted in Yakutpura, Panjrapole, Fatehpura and Kumbharvada in the city on Thursday after some alleged derogatory posts about a religion were put on social networking site Facebook.\n\"With the arrival of two more State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) companies, the total number of its companies deployed in the city has gone up to 13.\nYesterday, mobile internet facility in the city was suspended as a precautionary measure to check the spread of rumours which could spark communal tension.\nFollowing the attack, sporadic incidents of stone throwing took place in Panigate, Wadi, Memon Colony, Ajwa Road and Navapura areas of the city, he said."}
