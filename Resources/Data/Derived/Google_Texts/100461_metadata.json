It said Facebook is still in the \u201cidea-gathering stage.\u201d\n\nIf Facebook does enter the health and wellness space, it will join an increasingly crowded market, alongside Apple\u2019s new \u201cHealth\u201d app, and Google\u2019s program to advance medicine using big data.\n\nFacebook\u2019s potential move into healthcare could open a vast and valuable new area of data collection for the social network, which has been pushing for new ways to build detailed, personal profiles of its users so it can better target advertisements at them.\n\nIn June, Facebook began using the Internet browsing histories of its users for advertising purposes. It also required users to download a separate instant messaging app in order to send and receive Facebook messages on mobile phones, which could help Facebook gather data on user behavior.\n\nAny Facebook move into health care will draw scrutiny from privacy advocates, who say Facebook has gone too far in its collection of user data. According to Reuters, Facebook may roll out its first health application \u201cquietly and under a different name,\u201d so as not to alert users that they are handing health information to Facebook.
