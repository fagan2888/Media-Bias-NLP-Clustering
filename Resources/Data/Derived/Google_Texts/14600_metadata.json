Terry McAuliffe granted 206,000 felons the right to vote in April, including rapists and murderers, and have been working around the clock to get them on voter rolls.\n\nAccording to a report by the Washington Post, activists want to swing the state for the Democratic nominee in November and for Democratic state officials. They\u2019ve registered over 2,000 felons in two weeks. Hours after McAuliffe gave his order, activists were in poor and urban neighborhoods to start signing up ex-cons.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAs the Post notes:\n\nOnly a fraction of those eligible are likely to cast ballots on Election Day, but in a state with a recent spate of close elections, even a small number of new voters could affect the outcome. And a new bloc of voters could decide not only the presidential contest in this swing state but also the winner of the 2017 governor\u2019s race, who will have influence over the upcoming once-a-decade round of redistricting for state legislative and congressional districts.\n\nIt\u2019s easier for donors to give money to nonprofits signing up new voters, since their donation won\u2019t cut into spending caps on giving to campaigns themselves.\n\nVirginia Republicans have already announced they plan to sue McAuliffe, who has to sign a new order to make even violent felons eligible to vote (and serve on juries, run for office, and work as a notary).\n\n\u201cIt is hard to describe how transparent the Governor\u2019s motives are. The singular purpose of Terry McAuliffe\u2019s governorship is to elect Hillary Clinton President of the United States. This office has always been a stepping stone to a job in Hillary Clinton\u2019s cabinet,\u201d Virginia House of Delegates Speaker William J. Howell said in a harsh statement criticizing McAuliffe in April.\n\nLikely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton praised McAuliffe\u2019s move, tweeting she\u2019s \u201cproud of my friend\u201d for \u201ccontinuing to break down barriers to voting.\u201d\n\nMcAuliffe also mocked Republicans, telling them to \u201cquit complaining\u201d and to scramble to win the newly-expanded felon vote which now includes murderers, rapists, burglars, violent drug traffickers, kidnappers, arsonists, child abusers, those convicted of aggravated assault, and more.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Report: Leftist Groups Registered Two Thousand Virginia Felons to Vote in Two Weeks", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Report: Leftist Groups Registered Two Thousand Virginia Felons to Vote in Two Weeks", "title": "Report: Leftist Groups Registered Two Thousand Virginia Felons to Vote in Two Weeks - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/04/GettyImages-478685400.png", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/05/06/report-leftist-groups-registered-two-thousand-virginia-felons-to-vote-in-two-weeks/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Report: Leftist Groups Registered Two Thousand Virginia Felons to Vote in Two Weeks", "creator": "@k_mcq", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/04/GettyImages-478685400.png", "title": "Report: Leftist Groups Registered Two Thousand Virginia Felons to Vote in Two Weeks - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Felon Voting, Terry McAuliffe, virginia,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Hillary Clinton,McAuliffe", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "virginia", "published_time": "2016-05-06T13:56:09-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race,Hillary Clinton"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "According to a report by the Washington Post, activists want to swing the state for the Democratic nominee in November and for Democratic state officials.\nTerry McAuliffe granted 206,000 felons the right to vote in April, including rapists and murderers, and have been working around the clock to get them on voter rolls.\nVirginia Republicans have already announced they plan to sue McAuliffe, who has to sign a new order to make even violent felons eligible to vote (and serve on juries, run for office, and work as a notary).\nThey\u2019ve registered over 2,000 felons in two weeks.\nHours after McAuliffe gave his order, activists were in poor and urban neighborhoods to start signing up ex-cons."}
