(AP) - Tucson police say someone intentionally placed spikes on five manhole covers around the city on Tuesday, causing tires to blow out on 10 cars.\n\nThis marks the third time this year that spikes have been left on roads, severely damaging cars and posing a serious threat, spokesman Sgt. Pete Dugan said.\n\nSo far only tires have fallen victim to the spikes.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s only a matter of time.

The spikes appear to be bolts that were sharpened and are the same as those found in the prior incidents. They were also found in the same general area, the city\u2019s east side. In total, around 15 cars have fallen victim to the scheme. Dugan said cars that run over the spikes lose not just one but two tires.\n\n\u201cSomebody\u2019s doing a little prank that could be extremely serious,\u201d Dugan said.\n\nPolice are asking for the public\u2019s help in identifying the person or people who have left the spikes on roads.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tucson police say someone intentionally placed spikes on five manhole covers around the city on Tuesday, causing tires to blow out on 10 cars.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Tucson police say someone intentionally placed spikes on five manhole covers around the city on Tuesday, causing tires to blow out on 10 cars.", "title": "Spikes left on Tucson roads damage several cars", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/12/spikes-left-on-tucson-roads-damage-several-cars/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/12/68388e5567d15115760f6a706700808e.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/12/68388e5567d15115760f6a706700808e.jpg", "description": "Tucson police say someone intentionally placed spikes on five manhole covers around the city on Tuesday, causing tires to blow out on 10 cars.", "card": "summary", "title": "Spikes left on Tucson roads damage several cars"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "This marks the third time this year that spikes have been left on roads, severely damaging cars and posing a serious threat, spokesman Sgt.\nPolice are asking for the public\u2019s help in identifying the person or people who have left the spikes on roads.\nPolice believe the same person left spikes on manhole covers in January and last month.\nTUCSON, Ariz.
