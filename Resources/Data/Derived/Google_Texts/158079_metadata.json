He said he was arrested for leaving a Bible in his hotel room, but the pretext doesn\u2019t really matter. North Korea takes prisoners as state policy, a way to fine-tune its hostility level with the United States and indulge its paranoia just a bit. And like the rest of its leader\u2019s manias, there are certainly more hostage crises to come.\n\nNorth Korea is usually treated by the media as something of an historical accident, like America\u2019s ownership of Guam or the statehood of the Vatican. Its behavior also seems retro, a hostage\u2013taking relic of power politics unsuited for the modern world. Other states grew up during the First War and Second World Wars, and then the Cold War, and then post-9/11 period. They sub-divided and shed dictators and terror and swapped ideology for cash, and most of the worst moved on to something else.\n\nRelated: North Korea Unexpectedly Frees American Jeffrey Fowle\n\nNorth Korea never moved on. It was born of the military confluence of the Second World War and the Yalta Conference where FDR, still uncertain about his nuclear bomb, asked Stalin to help him against the Japanese. Stalin was more than happy to oblige, and in return, he got Poland. Korea and Poland are actually quite similar, both hard-used by history and trapped between large, hungry, antagonistic neighbors with no real borders.\n\nAs a result, for long stretches of Korean political history, there has been not one state but many, often clients of China and its rivals. There was the Proto-Three Kingdoms period, during the Iron Age; the Three Kingdoms, for five hundred years until 668; and then the Later Three Kingdoms, until 936. Korea experienced bouts of unification until the late 1500\u2019s, until pre-Tokugawa Japan invaded in 1592, en route to China At the beginning of the 20th century, it again fell under Japanese domination after Tokyo\u2019s wars against China and then Russia. The Japanese occupied the peninsula for four decades and are not remembered fondly.\n\nAmerica is a relative latecomer to the Korean peninsula. After the Second World War, Korea was divided into Soviet and American zones. Reunification talks collapsed because the powers occupying Korea had conflicting interests, which seemed unnatural to everyone except the Koreans.\n\nThe U.S. nearly abdicated its role in 1950 when Truman\u2019s Secretary of State Dean Acheson accidentally (or not) excluded Korea from the U.S. defense perimeter in Asia. Stalin and Kim \u2013 the elder Kim \u2013 saw the green light, and invaded the South in June 1950.\n\nRelated: North Korea Envoy Says Door Is Open on Nuclear Issues\n\nThe war ended with U.S. troops back in Korea, facing off against the Chinese, very nearly where the two sides had started. \u201cEnded\u201d is perhaps the wrong term for a conflict that still hangs fire; the North and South are still legally very much at war, each with different backers, each dependent \u2013 per Korean history \u2013 on someone else.\n\nKorea has only been unified when its neighbors are weak, and China\u2019s growing strength means it can support Kim\u2019s \u2018North\u2019 for the foreseeable future. That cuts both ways, though: the Chinese also can\u2019t abandon him, lest one of their other rivals unify and ally the Koreas against them. The Americans would be worse than the Kims and the Japanese worse than the Americans\u2014and a whole Korea might ally with either.\n\nThe Chinese do not like Kim; they do not particularly like his state; but they will ensure that there will always be, in one form or another, a Kim in the North. Because the pattern of East Asian power politics for the past four thousand years says that if China does not fill the Korean vacuum somebody else will.\n\nRelated: \u201cNo Problem at All\u201d for North Korea Leader Kim\u2019s Health\n\nKim \u2013 Kim the Younger, Kim the despot, Kim of the belly but not the hair \u2013 is thus a millionaire\u2019s son distilled large. He\u2019s a child without limits and accountability, living a Scarface life atop Caesar\u2019s Palace in a prison. His behavior \u2013 and that of all the Kims, as the amplitude of their insanity grows larger \u2013 is due not to being a dictator but to being an irreplaceable one. They are a product of their country\u2019s singularly unfortunate geography, and their status as a necessary client state of China.\n\nAt some point, almost certainly, Kim Jong Un will die. It\u2019s not wholly undisputed, of course: the North Koreans\u2019 political theology allows only that the father and grandfather Kim has reduced their public appearances. But in reality, as man born of flesh, all Kims must die.\n\nWhat will survive is Kimism: the stunted, kaleidoscope Carnivale of North Korea, for which totalitarianism is insufficiently total as a word. There will thus be more hostages, more Fowles and Baes and Millers. There will be more Dennis Rodman trips, and outlandish Kim haircuts. There will be more because there can\u2019t not be more--not with the way the Korean game has always been played.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/10/22/China-Knows-Why-Kim-Jong-Un-Will-Never-Die", "type": "article", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02162014_Kim_Jong_Un.jpg", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "title": "China Knows Why Kim Jong Un Will Never Die"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/10/22/China-Knows-Why-Kim-Jong-Un-Will-Never-Die", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02162014_Kim_Jong_Un.jpg", "creator": "@AndrewLPeek", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: \u201cNo Problem at All\u201d for North Korea Leader Kim\u2019s HealthKim \u2013 Kim the Younger, Kim the despot, Kim of the belly but not the hair \u2013 is thus a millionaire\u2019s son distilled large.\nAfter the Second World War, Korea was divided into Soviet and American zones.\nWhat will survive is Kimism: the stunted, kaleidoscope Carnivale of North Korea, for which totalitarianism is insufficiently total as a word.\nNorth Korea is usually treated by the media as something of an historical accident, like America\u2019s ownership of Guam or the statehood of the Vatican.\nNorth Korea released Jeffrey Fowle yesterday, one of three American hostages held in its jails."}
