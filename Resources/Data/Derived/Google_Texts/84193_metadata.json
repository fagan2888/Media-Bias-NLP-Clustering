But here in Hawaii, their biggest political battles are a bit easier\u2013rather than engage in desperate trench warfare to keep government from making it harder for women to get birth control, they advocate for bills that would actually make access to contraceptives easier.\n\nLike House Bill 1895, which was introduced by a dozen or so House members including Lynn DeCoite, D\u2013East Maui, Molokai and Lanai. The bill expands \u201caccess to prescription contraceptives by requiring insurers to cover contraceptive supplies intended to last up to a twelve-month period.\u201d (Its companion bill in the Senate\u2013SB 2319\u2013was introduced by nine senators, including Roz Baker, D\u2013South Maui.)\n\nIn testimony on Feb. 5 before the House Committee on Health, Laurie Field, Planned Parenthood\u2019s Hawaii Legislative Director and Public Affairs Manager, expressed complete support for the bill.\n\n\u201cBirth control is highly effective so long as it is used consistently, so a steady and reliable supply is key to reducing unplanned pregnancy,\u201d said Field in her testimony. \u201cDispensing a one-year supply of birth control is associated with a 30 percent reduction in the odds of experiencing an unplanned pregnancy compared with dispensing for 30 or 90 days. This means that making contraception more accessible also saves money. By preventing just one unintended pregnancy, an insurer will save the cost of a delivery\u2013a minimum of $17,400. That is enough savings to pay for 29 additional years of contraception.\u201d\n\nBut other organizations\u2013health insurance firms, pharmacies and even the Hawaii Chamber of Commerce\u2013weren\u2019t so effusive. Though they did phrase their concerns very carefully, typically pointing out that they \u201csupport the intent\u201d of the bill before criticizing it.\n\n\u201cWith an overabundant supply of prescribed contraceptives, Kaiser Permanente Hawaii is concerned with potential waste if the woman decides to stop using them or decides to switch contraceptives during the course of the year,\u201d John M. Kirimitsu, Kaiser\u2019s Legal and Government Relations Consultant, testified on Feb. 5. Eric P. Douglas, the Government Affairs Senior Director for the pharmacy chain CVS, even wondered why the bill was needed, since the Affordable Care Act made contraceptives free to those with health insurance.\n\n\u201cPerhaps most concerning is that since 2010\u2019s passage of the Affordable Care Act (\u2018ACA\u2019), contraceptives are required to be covered at a $0 copay/coinsurance benefit to members,\u201d Douglas testified on Feb. 5. \u201cTherefore, no matter how large the days of supply, it doesn\u2019t cost the member any additional dollars to pick up, whether monthly or otherwise. This 12-month provision certainly provides an opportunity for a member to stock up on a year\u2019s supply before quitting their job or dropping their insurance.\n\nKaiser\u2019s Kirimitsu also speculated that allowing 12-month prescriptions could lead to health risks for women.\n\n\u201cAlso, most important is that a woman\u2019s health may be compromised if she is prescribed an overabundance of such contraceptives because there will be no physician monitoring of the drug\u2019s risks and side effects. Through routine monitoring, a physician can discuss suitable alternatives in order to ensure a woman finds the contraceptive method that best suits her and her health best. Arguably, giving a year\u2019s supply of contraceptives may enhance the expectation that the method is acceptable and safe, while a less prescribed supply may encourage the woman to reconsider use of the method at each resupply visit.\u201d\n\nBut other medical professionals weren\u2019t having any of that.\n\n\u201cProviding a greater number of birth control pill packs at once is associated with higher continuation rates,\u201d stated the Hawaii Medical Association\u2019s Feb. 5 testimony (the association strongly supports the bill). \u201cDispensing a greater number of birth control pill packs at once is associated with fewer pregnancy tests, fewer unplanned pregnancies, and decreased health care costs per woman.\u201d\n\nSusan J. Wurtzburg, Ph.D., the Policy Chair for the American Association of University Women, also directly attacked the \u201cincreased costs\u201d argument.\n\n\u201cAn examination of the 2010 unintended pregnancy rates by states demonstrates that Hawaii scores as one of the most highly ranked states (www.guttmacher.org), ultimately costing individuals and taxpayers vast amounts of dollars, which could be spent in more productive ways, if contraceptive prescriptions were dispensed in a manner suiting women,\u201d Wurtzburg said in her testimony, which was also in support of the bill. \u201cBarriers to taking contraceptive pills consistently include women\u2019s lack of access to transportation, forgetting, pharmacy not filling orders in a timely manner, pharmacists not stocking sufficient amounts of pills, etc.\u201d\n\nThe House Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection will hold a hearing on HB 1895 next, on Wednesday, Feb. 17.\n\nPhoto: ParentingPatch/Wikimedia Commons", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Maui Time", "description": "In many states these days, especially in the south, organizations like Planned Parenthood fight to maintain women\u2019s access to contraceptives.
