Dancers in lingerie gyrate on poles to the booming techno. Actors dressed as aliens pose for selfies with partygoers. There\u2019s an open bar and waiters weave through the crowd passing out chocolate truffles.\n\nIt\u2019s the closing night of the National Workers\u2019 Compensation and Disability Conference & Expo.\n\nThe party at Light, a Cirque du Soleil-themed club at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, capped off the workers\u2019 comp industry\u2019s biggest annual networking event. For three days in November, hundreds of vendors wooed insurers and employers with lavish after-hours parties, giveaways of designer handbags, photos with Olympic gymnast Kerri Strug, and free rides in orange Hummer limousines.\n\nA top manager for a major insurance company recalled standing amid the hoopla a few years back when a company CEO turned to her and marveled: \u201cAll of this because somebody got hurt at work.\u201d\n\nWorkers\u2019 comp is supposed to be simple. If you\u2019re injured on the job, your employer pays your medical bills and part of your wages while you recover.\n\nBut over the past two decades, a cottage industry of middlemen has emerged, which some have dubbed the \u201cworkers\u2019 comp industrial complex.\u201d Even private equity firms have bought in, seeing profit opportunities in employers\u2019 and insurers\u2019 quest to contain spending.\n\nThe middlemen offer an array of services, from managing claims to negotiating medical bills, all promising to reduce costs \u2014 although critics say some actually raise them, as well as the burden on those hurt on the job.\n\nIt\u2019s a world largely unknown to the injured workers that the firms ultimately serve, and often to the employers who spent an estimated $89 billion on workers\u2019 comp in 2013.\n\nOver the past year, ProPublica and NPR have detailed how state after state has reduced the benefits historically granted to injured workers. As a result, some workers have been evicted from their homes, denied medical care, and put in humiliating situations.\n\nWhile lawmakers have clamped down on payments to workers, doctors, and lawyers, little scrutiny has been given to these \u201ccost containment\u201d firms \u2014 even though today they arguably have more influence on how injury benefits are handled than insurers and employers.\n\nHighlighting the bounty, there are now more than 150 workers\u2019 comp conferences a year. There\u2019s one for the American Society of Workers Comp Professionals, one for the Association of Workers\u2019 Compensation Professionals and one for the Association of Workers\u2019 Compensation Claims Professionals. At least 26 have golf tournaments.\n\nAt the National Workers\u2019 Compensation and Disability Conference & Expo, vendors gave away Apple watches, bottles of bourbon, and a Vespa scooter. There were free massages and shoeshines, a superhero caricature artist, more than one mentalist, and a live alligator named Spike.\n\nOver the past year, conference attendees have heard from Pete Rose, Arianna Huffington, Ted Koppel, Herschel Walker, and Joan Jett & the Blackhearts.\n\nRarely have they heard from injured workers.\n\n\u201cEven though the injured worker is the center of the claim, they\u2019re very far removed from what actually happens to them,\u201d says David DePaolo, editor of the industry news site, WorkCompCentral. \u201cIt\u2019s very dehumanizing. Why aren\u2019t injured workers part of the conferences? It\u2019s because they\u2019re a number.\u201d\n\nPRIVATE EQUITY BUYING SPREE\n\nLast year, workers\u2019 comp insurers in California spent 36 percent of premiums on overhead \u2014 more than they spent on medical care. That\u2019s over twice what group health plans can spend on administrative costs under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nA glimpse of the Vegas expo shows why. There were companies that provide networks of doctors and companies that review medical bills, firms that provide expert medical opinions, and firms that specialize in complex claims. There were defense lawyers, data processing firms, rehab facilities, surveillance companies, outside claims shops, occupational medicine clinics, pain management services, translators, schedulers, headhunters, and associations promoting other conferences.\n\nMyMatrixx, a pharmacy benefit manager focused on workers\u2019 comp, chartered several Hummer limousines wrapped in the firm\u2019s orange logo.

There were even labs that test urine to ensure workers are taking the prescribed drugs instead of selling them.\n\nIn California, the amount of money that insurers spend on medical cost containment programs has more than doubled from $197 million in 2005 to $471 million in 2014, according to the state workers\u2019 comp ratings bureau.\n\nSeeing huge profit potential, private equity firms have gone on a buying spree.\n\nSedgwick, a company that processes claims for large employers, was acquired by two private equity firms for $1.1 billion in 2010 and then sold to another for $2.4 billion in 2014. One Call Care Management, known in the industry as a medical \u201ccost containment\u201d firm, was bought for more than $2 billion in 2013, and reportedly bid to buy another vendor, pharmacy benefit manager Helios, for $2 billion this fall.\n\nSome of the biggest firms \u2014 Sedgwick, Genex, Helios, CorVel, MedRisk and One Call \u2014 are little known outside the workers\u2019 comp industry. But they have become powerful players in determining the future of how injured workers are treated.\n\nThe companies say they play a critical role in reducing excessive medical costs and preventing inappropriate treatment. Southern California, for example, has recently witnessed a series of scandals involving doctors and hospital executives who\u2019ve been accused of bribery, kickbacks, and unnecessary surgeries involving workers\u2019 comp patients.\n\nSome firms advertise that they analyze data to find the best doctors and can get injured workers in to see them faster than the general public. They say their data tools help employers identify safety problems and manage long-term claims before they spiral out of control.\n\nRobert Hartwig, president of the Insurance Information Institute, says the companies have become necessary as medical care, and the regulations for delivering it across 50 different state systems, have become increasingly complex. The firms don\u2019t just reduce costs, he says, but also improve outcomes by helping employees get back to work quicker.\n\n\u201cCost containment is not a dirty phrase,\u201d Hartwig says. \u201cIf insurers were to eliminate cost containment because it was costing too much, I can assure you we would see a rapid escalation in fraud and abuse in the system. And we would quickly see an explosion in claims costs.\u201d\n\nIncreasingly, though, decisions to deny care aren\u2019t being made by workers\u2019 employers or insurers, but by these myriad claims administrators, managed care companies, and cost-containment firms. Some industry observers say the firms have added a layer of cold bureaucracy to an already complicated system. CorVel \u2014 a managed care and claims-handling firm whose stock price has nearly doubled in the last three years \u2014 recently sent letters to the widows of two police officers killed in the line of duty, wishing their husbands a \u201cspeedy recovery.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s even a Facebook group for injured workers who say they\u2019ve been mistreated by Sedgwick.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we have created the savings intended and I think we\u2019ve made the system a much more complex, difficult to navigate system,\u201d says Bob Wilson, who runs the popular industry site, WorkersCompensation.com.\n\nWilson says he jokes that even though he\u2019s been in the industry for 15 years, he still doesn\u2019t understand what some people do. \u201cNo wonder injured workers are getting lost in the system.\u201d\n\nCONTROVERSY IN COST CONTAINMENT\n\nAs business has boomed, little effort has been made to find out whether the companies are helping or hurting injured workers.\n\nEd Welch, former director of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Center at Michigan State University, says managed care is necessary in workers\u2019 comp.\n\n\u201cYou can look at the field of doctors and say this doctor is really good, he does a lot of back surgeries, he\u2019s very effective, we can negotiate a price,\u201d Welch says. But employers and insurance companies can also use managed care to limit benefits by finding the cheapest doctors or \u201cdoctors who will very rarely agree that work caused the disability,\u201d he says.\n\nOne of the field\u2019s most controversial niches is firms that supply doctors to provide second opinions for employers and insurers. This alone is a $4 billion a year industry in the United States, according to one of the leading firms, ExamWorks, whose stock price has tripled in the past four years. Treating physicians say such hired experts are often retired doctors who make quick decisions without fully understanding patients\u2019 medical histories.\n\nA recruitment letter for one medical review firm, which a doctor provided to ProPublica, promised an \u201cadditional revenue stream\u201d and said that \u201conce a provider is in the rhythm of performing these reviews they should easily be able to perform 4\u20135 an hour.\u201d\n\nMany cost-containment firms negotiate prices with doctors and other medical providers and then take a cut of the discount they provide to insurers. Often, the insurers and claims administrators receive fees and commissions from cost-containment firms for selling their services to employers, says Frank Pennachio of Oceanus Partners, an insurance consulting firm.\n\nSome cost-containment companies have found another way to profit, according to several doctors, insurance consultants, and other service providers who asked not to be named because they must do business with these companies. They say firms misrepresent the cost of services to insurers, pocketing not only the percent of savings but also the difference between the inflated price and the true charges.\n\n\u201cThe presence of these companies is becoming so overwhelming that providers are getting squeezed out,\u201d says Steve Cattolica, government relations director for a doctors\u2019 organization, the California Society of Industrial Medicine and Surgery. Some firms are \u201craising the costs of work comp health care without delivering any value.\u201d\n\nTHE WORKERS\u2019 COMP EXPO\n\nThe 43-story Mandalay Bay casino stands like a shimmering gold cathedral, towering over the Luxor pyramid and the Excalibur castle on the south end of the Vegas Strip.\n\nIt was the perfect setting for this year\u2019s expo, which featured panels on how to prevent claims from spiraling out of control, what to do about medical marijuana, and \u201cCurrent Trends in Urine Drug Screening \u2014 What the Research Shows.\u201d\n\nConferences like these are where insurer-driven ideas for legislative reforms spread. And they\u2019re also where deals are made, which explains the attention showered on those holding the purse strings.\n\nOne morning, those entering the expo were greeted by a latte bar, hosted by ExamWorks, with baristas etching elaborate patterns in the milk, like the face of a lion or Pac-Man eating a ghost. Convention-goers mingled at booths and browsed the swag. Strug posed for pictures, drawing people to one firm\u2019s booth while also raising money for charity. Some attendees lined up early to get wristbands for the after-hours parties.\n\nPrime Health Services, a cost-containment company, held its party at the Wynn casino\u2019s Tryst nightclub with a live band playing in front of the club\u2019s 90-foot waterfall and cocktails containing fake ice cubes with the company\u2019s logo.\n\nRising Medical Solutions, another cost-containment firm, hosted a Great Gatsby theme party with guests dressed as flappers. Paradigm Outcomes, a catastrophic case management firm, held its reception at the lounge inside the Cosmopolitan\u2019s three-story crystal chandelier. And Michael Sullivan & Associates, a defense law firm in California, held its party at the House of Blues\u2019 Foundation Room, whose website say it features \u201chigh-class debauchery\u201d and \u201cluxurious party rooms to suit any desire \u2014 no matter how wicked.\u201d\n\nBut none of them could compete with the closing-night blowout hosted by One Call that featured the acrobat, go-go dancers, and glowing aliens clad in spandex.\n\n\u201cIf I was an injured worker at home wondering how I would pay my bills, I would be sick to see this,\u201d says one insurance company manager who asked not to be named.\n\nOne Call, which is based in Jacksonville, Florida, said in a statement that such events are typically sponsored by companies in the industry as \u201ca cost of doing business\u201d and that it chose the Cirque du Soleil theme to keep with the conference\u2019s Las Vegas location.\n\n\u201cThe focus of One Call Care Management is to make sure that injured workers receive the best care possible, quickly and efficiently,\u201d its statement said. \u201cHaving opportunities for our colleagues to meet and connect is important for workers\u2019 compensation and for any industry.\u201d\n\nNot every conference is as elaborate as the national expo. Some focus on providing continuing education credits for lawyers and claims adjusters. Many states put on annual educational conferences to update stakeholders on new trends and regulatory issues.\n\nThis year, there were conferences in 104 cities in 41 states \u2014 more places than in the country song, \u201cI\u2019ve Been Everywhere.\u201d One hotel, the Beau Rivage Resort & Casino in Biloxi, Mississippi, hosted three workers\u2019 comp conferences in 2015.\n\nThere are so many conferences that there is even a website called CompEvent.com, which serves as a kind of Ticketmaster for them.\n\nAt this year\u2019s Risk and Insurance Management Society conference in New Orleans, MedRisk \u2014 a network of physical therapy and diagnostic imaging centers for workers\u2019 comp \u2014 led a parade through the French Quarter, complete with Mardi Gras performers and a brass band, to its reception at Latrobe\u2019s on Royal.\n\nAnd not to be outdone, the 70th Annual Workers\u2019 Compensation Educational Conference in Orlando featured a concert by rock \u2019n\u2019 roll legends Joan Jett & the Blackhearts.\n\nIn a video posted on Twitter, attendees bopped their heads as they sang along to her hit, \u201cBad Reputation.\u201d\n\nThis story originally appeared on ProPublica as \u201c\u2019All of This Because Somebody Got Hurt at Work\u2019\u201d and is re-published here under a Creative Commons license.", "article_metadata": {"description": "by Michael Grabel \u00b6\n\nA scantily clad acrobat dangles from the ceiling, performing flips and splits as machines puff smoke and neon lights bathe the dance f\u2026", "title": "A Wild Night at the Workers\u2019 Compensation Expo \u2014 Pacific Standard", "og": {"site_name": "Medium", "description": "by Michael Grabel \u00b6\n\nA scantily clad acrobat dangles from the ceiling, performing flips and splits as machines puff smoke and neon lights bathe the dance f\u2026", "title": "A Wild Night at the Workers\u2019 Compensation Expo \u2014 Pacific Standard", "url": "https://psmag.com/a-wild-night-at-the-workers-compensation-expo-9baba5706c7b", "image": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*QXj_508YomfwC_7W.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "always", "twitter": {"creator": "@PacificStand", "label1": "Reading time", "image": {"src": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*QXj_508YomfwC_7W.jpg"}, "site": "@Medium", "data1": "9 mins", "app": {"url": {"iphone": "medium://p/9baba5706c7b"}, "name": {"iphone": "Medium"}, "id": {"iphone": 828256236}}, "card": "summary"}, "author": "Pacific Standard", "al": {"web": {"url": "https://psmag.com/a-wild-night-at-the-workers-compensation-expo-9baba5706c7b"}, "android": {"url": "medium://p/9baba5706c7b", "app_name": "Medium", "package": "com.medium.reader"}, "ios": {"url": "medium://p/9baba5706c7b", "app_name": "Medium", "app_store_id": 828256236}}, "fb": {"app_id": 542599432471018, "smart_publish": {"robots": "noauto"}}, "theme-color": "#000000", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/medium", "published_time": "2016-01-09T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "https://psmag.com/@pacificstand"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "There\u2019s one for the American Society of Workers Comp Professionals, one for the Association of Workers\u2019 Compensation Professionals and one for the Association of Workers\u2019 Compensation Claims Professionals.\nEd Welch, former director of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Center at Michigan State University, says managed care is necessary in workers\u2019 comp.\nOver the past year, ProPublica and NPR have detailed how state after state has reduced the benefits historically granted to injured workers.\nHighlighting the bounty, there are now more than 150 workers\u2019 comp conferences a year.\nAs a result, some workers have been evicted from their homes, denied medical care, and put in humiliating situations."}
