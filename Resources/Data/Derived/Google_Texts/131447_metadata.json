It acts as a buffer, helping kids whose parents didn\u2019t, or couldn\u2019t, stimulate them enough (educationally) beforehand to reach a level playing field with regard to educational attainment. Many parents have suspected this for some time now, and new research from the University of Minnesota confirms it: Pre-kindergarten is crucial to not only children\u2019s development but also their readiness for the school system.\n\nThe study found that a full day of pre-K was the best way to evince these benefits, as opposed to only a half-day. It\u2019s obvious how a full day could be better. As the researchers wrote, a full day of preschool not only enriches children\u2019s educational experience, but also frees \u201cparental time to pursue career and educational opportunities,\u201d thereby providing access to families that might not otherwise enroll. It\u2019s a win-win, essentially.\n\nPre-K is critical to ending what\u2019s known as the school-readiness gap. Since at least the late 1990s, researchers have attributed poorer educational achievement in 12th grade to gaps that existed in first grade. According to the Harvard Graduate School of Education, blacks, Hispanics, and American Indian students have, on average, demonstrated lower scores on reading, math, and vocabulary skills when compared to whites and Asian Americans. The Center for American Progress, meanwhile, notes that by age 5, children from low-income families are 15 months behind.\n\nAlong with his colleagues, Dr. Arthur Reynolds, a researcher at the university, looked at how ready for the school system kids were, as well as attendance and parental involvement, at the end of the 2012 to 2013 school year. Most of the kids were from low-income minority families. The study focused on 11 schools in the Chicago area, and compared a full day of classes (seven hours, with 409 students) to a half day of classes (about three hours, with 573 students). They found that kids who attended full-day pre-K scored higher on tests of socio-emotional development, language, math, and physical health. Scores on literacy and cognitive development were also higher, but the researchers didn\u2019t find them significant, according to a statement.\n\nBut despite improvements in attendance and lower rates of \u201cchronic\u201d absences, parents still weren\u2019t getting involved \u2014 this speaks to the importance of having a full day of preschool. It\u2019s also the missing piece to all of this; it\u2019s the reason kids experience the gap in the first place, and the reason they continue to perform poorly further down the line. In a policy brief from the Lincy Institute, a University of Nevada research organization, the authors note that parents from low-income backgrounds take a \u201cbehind-the-scenes\u201d approach to supporting their kids because they often feel a \u201csense of exclusion\u201d when they compare themselves to wealthier, more involved parents. The brief suggested educators take part in at-home involvement, which can encourage trust between educator and students\u2019 families \u2014 later on, involvement at school can begin.\n\nImproving parental involvement may be a struggle worth handling in the longer term. After all, there are thousands of schools throughout the country. What the current study shows, however, is that we can lengthen the duration of pre-K classes in the meantime, with the hope that we can achieve what some parents aren\u2019t capable of: closing that gap.\n\nSource: Reynolds A, Richardson B, Hayakawa M, et al.
