Krugman argued that the \"current wave of Obama-bashing\" coming from both sides of the aisle is unwarranted. As he sees it, the commander-in-chief's progress on certain issues, like the economy, health care and national security, has made him one of the most \"successful presidents in American history.\" Krugman went on to lambast Obama's liberal critics, like West, for denouncing the president as one who \"posed as a progressive and turned out to be counterfeit.\"\n\nWest challenged Krugman in an interview with host Marc Lamont Hill, saying that the Princeton professor fundamentally misunderstood his comments.\n\n\"Paul, he\u2019s wrong. He\u2019s my dear brother and I appreciate his contribution, but he\u2019s wrong about that,\" West said. \"The claim from the left is not [that] Obama's eloquence would have pushed through against the Republicans' entrenched position.\"\n\nWest argued his assessment included valid economic criticisms from the left, including dissatisfaction with Obama's pandering to Wall Street following the financial crisis and his weak push for the stimulus bill. West said that Krugman's incorrect interpretation of the leftist critique distracted from such valid criticisms.\n\n\"[Krugman\u2019s critique is] a red herring for the left. So you can dismiss that, but you can\u2019t dismiss the substantial leftist critique,\" he said. \"Brother Krugman, he is a dyed-in-the-wool, genuine, progressive liberal. He\u2019s not a leftist.\"\n\nWatch the full interview with \"Black Prophetic Fire\" author and activist Cornel West here.\n\nSign up here for Live Today, HuffPost Live's new morning email that will let you know the newsmakers, celebrities and politicians joining us that day and give you the best clips from the day before!\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Obamacare Haters Obamacare Haters\n\n1 of 7 McDonald's Peter Bensen, McDonald's chief financial officer , said on a conference call last year that Obamacare will cost the company and its franchisees $140 million to $420 million per year.
