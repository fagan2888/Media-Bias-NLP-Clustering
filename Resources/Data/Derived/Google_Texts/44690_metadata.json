The report notes Sullivan\u2019s terrorist plot as the ninth in the U.S. this year, all of which involved individuals inspired by ISIS.\n\nThe report outlines recommendations for Congress to prevent terrorist attacks. These include:\n\nThe continuance of government surveillance programs\n\nA legal ability for local law enforcement to track terrorist activity online along with greater federal support of local and civil partners\n\nCooperation between intelligence and law enforcement among allied countries to track foreign fighters\n\n\u201cThere is no silver bullet,\u201d said David Inserra, author of the report and a homeland security expert The Heritage Foundation.\n\nHe said the recommendations are \u201ccritical to putting together the dots and stopping terrorists before they strike.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the U.S. and others have taken steps forward on counterterrorism, we have also taken some steps back,\u201d Inserra said. \u201cThe recent debate over the PATRIOT Act has weakened the U.S. counterterrorism capabilities and so the U.S. must rely more heavily on its other tools at just the time when it terrorist activity is spiking.\u201d\n\nThe Heritage analysis was published soon after a State Department report found a massive increase in global terrorist attacks this past year.\n\nThe annual report published earlier this month revealed nearly 33,000 people were killed in almost 13,500 terrorist attacks in 2014. The number of attacks marked a 35 percent increase from 2013 while the death toll from these attacks jumped 81 percent.\n\nThe attacks occurred in 95 countries, but were most recurrent in Iraq, Syria, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. ISIS and the Nigerian-based terrorist group, Boko Haram, were cited heavily in the report.\n\nBut the report noted that al-Qaeda\u2019s leadership \u201cappeared to lose momentum as the self-styled leader in the face of ISIL\u2019s rapid expansion.\u201d\n\nThough the group\u2019s leadership has weakened, the report said al-Qaeda remains the \u201cfocal point of \u2018inspiration\u2019 for a worldwide network of affiliated groups.\u201d\n\nThe State Department cited the Syrian civil war as a significant driver of the increase in terrorism, as more than 16,000 foreign terrorists from more than 90 countries flocked to the crumbling country to fight. The majority joined ISIS, enabling the group to expand in both Syria and Iraq.\n\n\u201cDespite the fragmentation of al-Qaeda and its affiliates, weak or failed governance continued to provide an enabling environment for the emergence of extremist radicalism and violence,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe scale of the attacks was also more fatal in 2014, with 20 separate attacks killing more than 100 people per attack. In 2013, only two were as deadly.\n\nThe State Department said the increase in attacks might indicate a \u201cnew era\u201d of lone wolf terrorism in which group identity is \u201cmore fluid\u201d and individuals carry out \u201cself-directed\u201d attacks to achieve a broader goal.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to spend much time looking at the news to see that terrorist groups are active all across the Middle East,\u201d Inserra said. \u201cIncreased activity and military successes are certainly attracting additional fighters to their cause, whether those fighters go to the Middle East or stay at home.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. is experiencing its highest level of terrorist activity since September 11th, according to a Heritage Foundation report published Monday.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The U.S. is experiencing its highest level of terrorist activity since September 11th, according to a Heritage Foundation report published Monday.", "title": "Terrorist Attempts In U.S. Reach Highest Level Since 9/11", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150629_TerrorPlots.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-29T14:33:44+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Bz1hnt"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The U.S. is experiencing its highest level of terrorist activity since September 11th, according to a Heritage Foundation report published Monday.", "title": "Terrorist Attempts In U.S. Reach Highest Level Since 9/11", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150629_TerrorPlots.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "terrorism", "published_time": "2015-06-29T03:01:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T14:33:44+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Terrorism, Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, ISIS, Boko Haram, State Department, 9/11"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb690\"", "article_summary": "The annual report published earlier this month revealed nearly 33,000 people were killed in almost 13,500 terrorist attacks in 2014.\nThe report outlines recommendations for Congress to prevent terrorist attacks.\nISIS and the Nigerian-based terrorist group, Boko Haram, were cited heavily in the report.\nThe report notes Sullivan\u2019s terrorist plot as the ninth in the U.S. this year, all of which involved individuals inspired by ISIS.\nThe case is the 71st publicly known terrorist plot in the United States since 9/11."}
