Last week, a market analysis firm reported that 440,000 people in 10 states have signed up for Medicaid in the six weeks since enrollment began "Medicaid is exceeding expectations in most places," said Dan Mendelson, Avalere's president. "It is definitely a bright picture in states that have chosen to expand."

The Medicaid expansion is financed by the federal government for the first three years, but decreases after that to 90 percent. The state's assumption of financial responsibility is among the reasons some states have balked at the Medicaid expansion. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) argued, "Cash-strapped states are also feeling the burden of the Medicaid entitlement. The program consumes nearly 22 percent of states’ budgets today, and things are about to get a whole lot worse.”
