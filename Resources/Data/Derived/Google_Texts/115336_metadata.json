(WKRN) \u2013 A 28-year-old woman was shot in the head and lives to tell the story. Despite all she has been through, Tara Ellis is staying positive.\n\nEllis was at an apartment complex in Bellevue with a group of people on Sept. 7 when the man who lives there showed his gun to everyone.\n\nMetro police said another man was holding the gun when it accidentally went off, striking Ellis in the back of the head.\n\n\u201cWe were at a friend\u2019s apartment. We were about to go to the movies and that\u2019s kind of the last thing I remember other than waking up with the paramedics,\u201d said Ellis.\n\nShe was hospitalized at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center for over a week and released Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s terrifying not being able to do simple things I could do last week,\u201d said Ellis.\n\nEllis told News 2 she can\u2019t see out of her left eye, she has no feeling on her left side and has to endure months of physical rehab.\n\n\u201cWashing my hair is a huge issue it\u2019s really difficult you know it\u2019s hard to wash my hands or open the refrigerator,\u201d said Ellis.\n\n\u201cWay better than I should be doing,\u201d she said when asked how she was. \u201cI am more than fortunate, more than blessed. Just trying to stay focused on my rehab and becoming 100 percent again.\u201d\n\nMetro police said they are still investigating the incident.\n\n\u201cEducate yourself, educate your family on any kind of gun safety. It\u2019s such a simple act and it can save so many lives,\u201d said Ellis.\n\nEllis doesn\u2019t have insurance to cover the cost of physical therapy. A GoFundMe account was set up to help with the bills.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tara Ellis was unintentionally shot in the head on Sept. 7.
