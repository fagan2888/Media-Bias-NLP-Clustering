The Huffington Post reports that when Marianne Keith came into Advocate Condell Medical Center with severe stomach pain, doctors recommended a transvaginal ultrasound \u2013 a procedure that uses ultrasonography to image the pelvic organs. An essential component of early prenatal care, the ultrasound is also applied for diagnostic purposes, as it can also detect abnormalities in the area.\n\nAccording to Keith, the situation took a dark turn shortly after the hospital technician began the procedure.\n\n\"After I left the hospital, I knew by how much pain I was in that something was done to me,\" she told reporters. \"It felt like I was being raped.\"\n\nAfter some time, the emotional trauma became too much, and Keith decided to take legal action against the healthcare provider. Today, ubiquitous triggers cause her to relive the situation over and over again in her own home, and she\u2019s still afraid of going to the hospital.\n\n\"I have nightmares about being trapped and going through this procedure again. I have so many triggers -- watching television, and whenever a woman is hurt or raped or something happens on TV, I think about it again,\u201d she explained. \u201cMy husband and I don't have any type of intimacy, because I don't want anybody touching me. I have physical things that are the matter with me, and I can\u2019t even go to the doctor anymore.\"\n\nKeith also stressed that she has had the procedure several times in the past, during fertility treatments. While she didn\u2019t care for them either, she says the February incident was a particularly abusive experience.\n\n\"Even if it's done the way that it should be done, it's so intrusive,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvocate Condell Medical Center has not commented on the pending lawsuit.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "transvaginal ultrasound, transvaginal ultrasound rape, marianne keith, advocate condell medical center, post-traumatic stress", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Marianne Keith is suing an Illinois hospital after a transvaginal ultrasound left her with recurring nightmares and post-traumatic stress.", "title": "Marianne Keith, 52, Sues Hospital Over Ultrasound 'Rape'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/marianne-keith-52-sues-hospital-over-ultrasound-rape-something-was-done-me-she-says-256508", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/11/ultrasound.PNG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Marianne Keith is suing an Illinois hospital after a transvaginal ultrasound left her with recurring nightmares and post-traumatic stress.", "title": "Marianne Keith, 52, Sues Hospital Over Ultrasound 'Rape'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/marianne-keith-52-sues-hospital-over-ultrasound-rape-something-was-done-me-she-says-256508", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/11/ultrasound.PNG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/11/ultrasound.PNG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-09-11T23:43:53-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-12T01:58:57-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Marianne Keith is suing an Illinois hospital after a transvaginal ultrasound left her with recurring nightmares and post-traumatic stress."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde6ae\"", "article_summary": "\"I have so many triggers -- watching television, and whenever a woman is hurt or raped or something happens on TV, I think about it again,\u201d Marianne Keith, 52, told reporters.\nAccording to Keith, the situation took a dark turn shortly after the hospital technician began the procedure.\nThe Huffington Post reports that when Marianne Keith came into Advocate Condell Medical Center with severe stomach pain, doctors recommended a transvaginal ultrasound \u2013 a procedure that uses ultrasonography to image the pelvic organs.\nAfter some time, the emotional trauma became too much, and Keith decided to take legal action against the healthcare provider.\nKeith also stressed that she has had the procedure several times in the past, during fertility treatments."}
