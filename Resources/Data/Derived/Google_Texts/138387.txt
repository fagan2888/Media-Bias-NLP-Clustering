Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius dodged a question Friday about whether she offered her resignation during or after the bungled Obamacare rollout in October.

“I’m not going to discuss what I talk about with the president,” Sebelius said, responding to a question from a reporter in Florida, as captured in video from Miami Herald reporter Marc Caputo.

Sebelius also dodged a question from Caputo about the fact-checking website Politifact awarding “Lie of the Year” to President Obama’s statement that “if you like your health care plan, you can keep it.”

Sebelius twice dodged questions on the topic. First, the HHS secretary offered a long explanation of the “if you like your plan” promise, declining to answer the “lie of the year” claim, and then ignoring a follow-up question also posed by Caputo.
