Anne Arundel Medical Center named Maulik Joshi Wednesday as its new executive vice president of Integrated Care Delivery and chief operating officer for the Annapolis hospital.

Maulik previously worked at the American Hospital Association in Chicago, Illinois, where he served as president of the Health Research & Educational Trust.

"This 'next-generation COO' is a new, transformational position for our organization, and one that I believe will help us continue to build on our successes as healthcare delivery channels continue to evolve under the Affordable Care Act and Maryland's all-payer system," said Tori Bayless, AAMC's president and CEO. "He will help us implement and streamline best practices in healthcare delivery as we continue to develop our capabilities in population health while maintaining our focus on providing the highest quality, patient-centered care."

Maulik has a doctorate in public health and a master's in health services administration from the University of Michigan and a bachelor of science in mathematics from Lafayette College.

He served on the Board of Trustees for Anne Arundel Medical Center, the Board Quality and Patient Safety Committee for Mercy Health System, the Health Outcomes Committee for Advocate Health Care, and was the treasurer of the Board of Trustees for the Center for Advancing Health.
