She was one of 24,000 people hoping for a shot of one of 750 available Sec. 8 housing vouchers. Ten thousand people were chosen at random for the Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority wait list. She was not one of them. \"If I had my choice of where I could live, it would be Henrico County,\" she says. \"It's quieter there and the schools are better.\" Here she poses with her four-year-old son, Jamarie. (Photo by Tina Griego)\n\nIn April of this year, the Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority opened its waiting list for what officially are called \u201chousing choice vouchers\u201d but are commonly known as Section 8 vouchers.\n\nThey allow a person living in poverty to move to an apartment or a house and rent at the same government-subsidized rate as someone living in public housing. (The tenant pays 30 percent of income, generally an average of about $200 to $300 a month; the rest is subsidized. The average subsidy is about $700 a month, but varies depending upon the number of bedrooms.)\n\nIn the hierarchy of government-subsidized public housing, vouchers are prized. Public housing communities \u2014 and they are communities \u00ad\u2014 nevertheless come with a stigma, with density, lack of privacy and all the issues created by packing people in hardship into several blocks of a neighborhood systemically drained of investment.\n\nQualify for a voucher, spend one year living in Richmond, then, as long as you remain qualified, you can move anywhere in the country that accepts Sec. 8. \u201cA golden ticket,\u201d says Carol A. Jones-Gilbert, RRHA\u2019s new chief operating officer. \u201cLike bricks of gold,\u201d says T.K. Somanath, the agency\u2019s chief executive officer.\n\nRRHA had not opened its wait list since 2003. It waited until March 2014 when it had whittled down the previous list of more than 10,000 applications to zero. Then it waited some more. In the waiting, the agency eventually forfeited more than $2 million in subsidies, enough for at least 300 vouchers. It waited until Somanath came on board in February and, alarmed, asked, \u201cWhy haven\u2019t we opened the wait list?\u201d\n\nThe bureaucratic negligence here demands its own inquiry, but let\u2019s look at what followed:\n\nRRHA reopened the list on April 20 at 9 a.m. By 1 p.m. 15,000 applications had flooded in. When it shut things down at the end of the week, then weeded out the duplicates, it had 24,000 applications.\n\nWait, there\u2019s more. The 24,000 households were entering a lottery to win not a voucher, but one of 10,000 spots on the new waiting list. Once on the list and approved, they lined up hoping to receive one of the vouchers that had been left sitting on the table. And how many of those were there? About 750.\n\nSomanath, who says he cannot explain why the wait list had not been reopened earlier, focuses on this bottom line: 24,000 households were competing for 750 available vouchers. \u201cIt just speaks to the pent-up demand,\u201d he says. \u201cNot just in Richmond, but in the region.\u201d\n\nWith this point in mind, I invite you to The Valentine's next Community Conversation on housing Nov. 3. Richmond magazine is a partner in hosting these conversations. This is also the RRHA\u2019s 75th anniversary, and the panel will include a presentation from Somanath, as well as from The Better Housing Coalition and Richmond Metropolitan Habitat for Humanity.\n\nA conversation about affordable housing, in general, isn\u2019t just a conversation about housing. It\u2019s a conversation about the city\u2019s tax base and, therefore, its economic prosperity. It\u2019s about improving the quality of neighborhood schools. It\u2019s about the suburbs, where the poverty rate is outpacing the city, and how the region connects three vital lynchpins of opportunity: \u201cJobs, transportation and housing,\u201d says David Herring, director of real estate for the Better Housing Coalition. \u201cIt\u2019s an interconnected web.\u201d\n\nAnd the first thing you should know about housing patterns here is the first thing you should know about housing patterns in most cities: They are not accidental.\n\n\u201cThe ugly truth of history is that high density poverty exists largely because it was designed that way.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s from page 26 of the Mayor\u2019s 2013 Anti-Poverty Commission report. The research came from John Moeser, senior fellow at the University of Richmond\u2019s Bonner Center for Community Engagement and a professor emeritus of urban studies and planning at Virginia Commonwealth University. He will tell you of the federal housing and lending practices that discriminated against African-Americans, of the transportation and zoning policies that destroyed thriving communities, of the white flight that created the neighborhoods we have now.\n\nThe maps you see with this Sunday Story? (See above.) They come from the fair housing organization Housing Opportunities Made Equal. They tell the story of patterns repeated in Richmond. The neighborhoods redlined by the federal Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation in the 1930s are the same neighborhoods disproportionally targeted in the mid-2000s for subprime loans, the same neighborhoods, then, vulnerable to the subsequent foreclosure crisis that gutted personal wealth and overall property values.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Can the city undo 60 years of failed public housing policy?", "generator": "Metro Publisher (www.metropublisher.com)", "og": {"site_name": "richmondmagazine.com", "description": "Can the city undo 60 years of failed public housing policy?", "title": "More Than Shelter", "url": "http://richmondmagazine.com/api/content/f6c0aeb2-7a6c-11e5-b974-22000b078648/", "image": "http://richmondmagazine.com/downloads/9524/download/phpstUq8TPM.jpg?cb=cfd682196c25293381478df3d807936e", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RichmondMag", "card": "summary", "creator": "@RichmondMag"}, "fb": {"app_id": 269543256729484}, "keywords": "Tina Griego,poverty,housing choice vouchers,University of Richmond,The Valentine,Section 8,federal housing,Mayor's Office of Community Wealth Building,public housing,Community Conversations,T.K.
