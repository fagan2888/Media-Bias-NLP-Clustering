The hunt was on Saturday in Panama City, an Easter egg hunt.

Hundreds of kids and parents came to H.G. Harders Park for their annual Easter egg hunt.

The Easter bunny made a special appearance to take pictures with all the kids.

After all the pictures were taken, the children raced to find different colored eggs with pieces of candy hidden inside. But it wasn't all for one out there, some of the kids made sure everyone got their fair share.

One mother explained, "My oldest was actually passing all of her's out to all the other kids that didn't get any. She doesn't have any, hardly, right now, but she was being very nice."

"I'm taking them, and putting the eggs out, so I can put the candy in (my bag)," said Constantine, a 5-year-old egg hunter.

There were two separate egg hunting areas, one for kids five to ten years old, and another four and under section.
