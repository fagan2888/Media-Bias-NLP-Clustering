Counting by total medals, the Sochi Winter Olympics have been a big win for the host country, Russia, whose 33 medals top the overall tally. The United States is second with 28, Norway is third with 26, Canada is fourth with 25, and the Netherlands is fifth with 24.

But there are several alternative ways to count medals. The economist Jared Bernstein, for instance, proposes a weighting scheme where gold medals count for 3, silver for 2, and bronze for 1.

Russiaâ€™s haul is even bigger by this accounting, adding up to 70 weighted medals. Canada is second with 55, Norway and the United States tied for third with 53, and the Netherlands next with 47.

But total medal counts do not reflect population size or the financial resources countries have at their disposal, as I wrote last week. In terms of population, for example, the U.S., is nearly four times bigger than Germany, almost 10 times the size of Canada, and more than 60 times larger than Norway. Which countries dominated in Sochi relative to their size and wealth?
