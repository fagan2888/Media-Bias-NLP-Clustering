Andrew Hinderaker for The Wall Street Journal It was no ordinary Monday for 50 local schoolchildren who spent the afternoon building bicycles in the lobby of Barclays Center in Brooklyn.\n\nBetween the excitement and breaks for cookies, the children, ages 6-10, were focused on assembling bicycle parts with the help of 100 volunteers, parents and bike mechanics from Ride Brooklyn.\n\n\u201cThey tricked me!\u201d Jadari Georges, 8 years old, said when he found out he was going to get to keep the bike he built.\n\nAnd that wasn\u2019t the only surprise. Professional BMX rider Nigel Sylvester and Nets players Jerome Jordan, Deron Williams, Jorge Gutierrez and Jarrett Jack also visited the children and helped fine-tune the final touches on the two-wheelers.\n\nEight-year-old Iris, who didn\u2019t give her last name, said she isn\u2019t really a Nets fan. But she couldn\u2019t stop smiling as she put the finishing touches on her bike and posed for pictures with Mr. Williams with her mom, Beatrice, who proudly sported a Nets jacket.\n\nMr. Jordan, at 7 feet, towered over the children as they scurried to have their bikes checked and get autographs with him and the other players.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always good when you can help out children,\u201d Mr. Jordan said. \u201cEspecially during the festive season.\u201d\n\nThe bikes were donated by the Nets and helmets were donated by Bell Helmets.\n\n\u201cThey tricked me!\u201d Jadari Georges, 8 years old, said when he found out he was going to get to keep the bike he built.\n\nAnd that wasn\u2019t the only surprise.
