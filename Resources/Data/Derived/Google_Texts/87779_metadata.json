Jim Rice, a Republican, said of Amy Dowd, to whom the board members at NMIX unanimously voted earlier this month to offer the job running the state\u2019s implementation of the Affordable Care Act, colloquially called \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nRice is a member of the \u201cYour Health Idaho\u201d board and sharply criticized Dowd after it was revealed a board member, Frank Chan, had been awarded a $375,000 technology contract by Dowd even though no bids from outside vendors were offered. Chan ended up quitting the same day the contract was announced.\n\n\u201cShe made a dumb mistake,\u201d Rice told New Mexico Watchdog in a telephone interview. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t repeated it. You just don\u2019t hire someone on your board.\u201d\n\nThe contract led to a two-week investigation, but the board of the Idaho health exchange made no personnel changes and Dowd remained as executive director.\n\n\u201cThe mistakes were not solely hers,\u201d Idaho state Sen. Fred Martin, a Republican, told New Mexico Watchdog.\n\nDespite saying at the time he was \u201cwas very upset when I learned of the contract being issued without approval from the board of directors,\u201d Martin said Monday, \u201cI\u2019m pleased with (Dowd\u2019s) performance here\u201d and went so far as to say Dowd \u201chas done an extremely good job running the exchange.\u201d\n\nEven Rice, who called for Dowd\u2019s dismissal when the story broke, said Monday that Dowd \u201coverall is somebody who is quite capable\u201d and pointed to the success of the Idaho exchange under Dowd\u2019s watch. \u201cWe have one of the highest enrollment rates, per capita, nationwide,\u201d Rice said.\n\nAn email to Dowd asking for an interview was not returned.\n\nNMHIX board member Dr. Deane Waldman said the board was aware of the flap over the no-bid contract.\n\n\u201cIt did not cause any concerns,\u201d Waldman said, describing Dowd as \u201cthe implementer, not the decision-maker.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe issue was really about making political hay,\u201d Waldman said.\n\nNMHIX officials announced Tuesday that Dowd will earn $199,000 a year and be eligible for a 10 percent performance bonus as part of her two-year contract. Dowd is expected to start in August. Dowd\u2019s salary in Idaho was $175,000.\n\n\u201cWe need a real visionary and the board got a sense from her that she could think beyond the lines,\u201d Waldman said.\n\nThe New Mexico exchange has been run on an interim basis by Mike Nu\u00f1ez. \u201cHe\u2019s a wonderful manager and we couldn\u2019t have gotten where we\u2019re at without him,\u201d Waldman said.\n\nContact Rob Nikolewski at rnikolewski@watchdog.org and follow him on Twitter @robnikolewski", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Amy Dowd, the new executive director of the New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange, comes highly recommended but she had to weather some controversy.
