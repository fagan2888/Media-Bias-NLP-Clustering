The health-care industry as a whole also reported a slowdown in employment, with 400 jobs lost in January compared with an average of about 17,000 jobs gained a month in 2013.\n\nThe job losses reflect an industry in flux as the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, takes full effect. Reimbursements for Medicare, the U.S. health plan for the elderly, are being reduced to help cover the insurance expansion under Obamacare, and hospitals are contending with lower payment rates from insurers on the public exchanges. In addition, care once provided at hospitals is shifting to outpatient settings, lowering patient volumes.\n\n\u201cThe next phase of health-care reform is likely to make the hospital operating and financial environment more difficult to navigate,\u201d George Huang, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities LLC, wrote in a Dec. 17 memo. \u201cGoing forward, management teams will have increasingly difficult business decisions, in our view, that may include reorganizing staff.\u201d\n\nJob Cuts\n\nHospitals in the U.S. eliminated thousands of jobs in 2013. The Cleveland Clinic closed \u201cseveral hundred open positions\u201d and released 700 workers through early retirement last year, spokeswoman Heather Phillips said in an e-mail.\n\nThe Ohio facility, one of the world\u2019s foremost medical and research centers, said last September that the early retirements and restructuring were needed to \u201cprepare for health-care reform.\u201d Other hospitals that eliminated positions last year included Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, and Baton Rouge-based Louisiana State University Health Care Services.\n\nHospitals are \u201cputting on the brakes\u201d while they wait to see the impacts of the Affordable Care Act, Mitch Morris, a Austin-based analyst for Deloitte Consulting LLP, said in a telephone interview. \u201cEveryone knows reimbursements are going down, so you\u2019d better get your house in order.\u201d\n\nMorris noted that job cuts and hiring freezes are among the many methods hospitals use to cut costs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a much more complex answer than just cutting people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about carefully looking around your business model and asking how you can deliver higher quality care faster and cheaper. You\u2019re not going to build that new hospital wing yet.\u201d\n\nPublicly Traded\n\nPublicly traded hospital companies may be more resilient to cost pressures because of their size, said Jennifer Lynch, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets Corp. \u201cThere\u2019s an inherent benefit in scale,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have more efficiency when you have 100 facilities.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for HCA Holdings Inc., the largest U.S. hospital operator by market capitalization, couldn\u2019t be reached for comment on the jobs report.\n\nHospital employment as a percentage of job growth the health-care industry also has declined. In 2011, 23 percent of jobs created in health care were in hospitals, according to Labor Department data. Last year, hospitals lost 400 jobs while the health-care industry gained 204,000.\n\nServices moving to outpatient facilities have contributed to the decline in hospital jobs, Lynch said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting better at doing higher acuity services in lower acuity settings,\u201d Lynch said in a phone interview. \u201cFor the payers, it\u2019s cheaper and for the providers, the work environment is more attractive with better scheduling.\u201d\n\nOutpatient Growth\n\nOutpatient care centers have seen steady job growth, according to Labor Department data. The sector has reported increases in monthly employment since July 2011.\n\nWhile hospitals have slowed down hiring for now, in the long term they will face increased demand from the newly insured and more baby boomers reaching retirement age.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to keep an eye on the big picture,\u201d Morris said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting older and living longer, so we\u2019ll need more health care.\u201d\n\nThere will be \u201ca tsunami\u201d of patients seeking care in the coming years, Peter McMenamin, senior policy fellow at the American Nurses Association, said in a phone interview. \u201cThis is a period of mixed signals,\u201d but ultimately, \u201cgrowth is almost guaranteed.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Caroline Chen", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-07/hospital-jobs-in-u-s-decline-for-second-straight-month", "site": "@business", "description": "Hospital jobs in the U.S. declined in back-to-back months for the first time in three years as medical care increasingly moves to outpatient facilities and hospitals anticipate reimbursement cuts under Obamacare.", "card": "summary", "title": "Hospital Jobs in U.S. Decline for Second Straight Month"}, "parsely-author": "Caroline Chen", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Health,Jobs", "news_keywords": "Health,Jobs", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-07/hospital-jobs-in-u-s-decline-for-second-straight-month", "parsely-title": "Hospital Jobs in U.S. Decline for Second Straight Month", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-02-08T05:01:00.004Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Hospital jobs in the U.S. declined in back-to-back months for the first time in three years as medical care increasingly moves to outpatient facilities and hospitals anticipate reimbursement cuts under Obamacare.", "parsely-tags": "Health,Jobs,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2014-02-08T05:01:00.004Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-07/hospital-jobs-in-u-s-decline-for-second-straight-month", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "type": "website", "description": "Hospital jobs in the U.S. declined in back-to-back months for the first time in three years as medical care increasingly moves to outpatient facilities and hospitals anticipate reimbursement cuts under Obamacare.", "title": "Hospital Jobs in U.S. Decline for Second Straight Month"}, "fb": {"status": "Hospital jobs in the U.S. declined in back-to-back months for the first time in three years as medical care increasingly moves to outpatient facilities and hospitals anticipate reimbursement cuts under Obamacare."}, "parsely-post-id": "N0N5HR6S972G01", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd82aa\"", "article_summary": "Services moving to outpatient facilities have contributed to the decline in hospital jobs, Lynch said.\nThe health-care industry as a whole also reported a slowdown in employment, with 400 jobs lost in January compared with an average of about 17,000 jobs gained a month in 2013.\nIn 2011, 23 percent of jobs created in health care were in hospitals, according to Labor Department data.\nHospitals lost 4,500 jobs in January, after dropping 4,700 jobs in December, the first consecutive two-month decline since February 2011, according to Labor Department figures released yesterday.\nHospital jobs in the U.S. declined in back-to-back months for the first time in three years as medical care increasingly moves to outpatient facilities and hospitals anticipate reimbursement cuts under Obamacare."}
