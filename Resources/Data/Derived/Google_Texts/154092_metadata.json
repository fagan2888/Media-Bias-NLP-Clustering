It isn\u2019t just fantasy nerds and TV junkies that are watching for a winner. HBO execs are hoping that producers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss will be able to recreate the magic that gave \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d a breakout season in 2013. But there are reasons for concern.\n\nSince the end of the third season, many have come and gone in TV Land. Don Draper got fired, Walter White\u2019s story came to a barnstorming conclusion, Frank Underwood schemed and conspired, \u201cTrue Detective\u201d asked metaphysical questions, a white girl went to prison, and that guy finally met his kids\u2019 mother\u2026or something.\n\nRelated: 12 Big Numbers Behind \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019\n\nThrough it all, there\u2019s no question that Thrones maintains its hold on pop culture. Not only are promotional materials for the show visible everywhere, but phrases like \u201cRed Wedding\u201d or \u201cWinter Is Coming\u201d have entered the pop culture lexicon. Internet culture, with its love of memes, has eagerly embraced the show, with both Ned Stark and Jon Snow clogging up Facebook feeds. Last year, record numbers of girls were named Arya and, bafflingly, Khaleesi.\n\nMeanwhile, Thrones has helped HBO to dispel notions that its subscriber base is beginning to falter, even though there is little question that cable powerhouse is beginning to feel the heat from Netflix and cord-cutters. Despite early denials, the network is now working on a stand-alone HBO GO app. For that to be successful, HBO needs its tentpole shows to still hold mass appeal.\n\nViewers and producers alike are ready for the return of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d and for it to be awesome; the question is\u2026will it be?\n\nThe Honeymoon Is Over\n\nSince its very first scene, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d has had one glaring problem. Its most engaging story was not its main story. If you recall the opening of the first scene, it is not the Starks and Lannisters nor Daenerys and the Dothraki, but nameless members of the Night's Watch encountering a reanimated corpse, which kills all but one of them. The entire show is a prelude to a zombie apocalypse, as if the opening 15 minutes of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d were stretched out over seasons.\n\nWith deepest apologies to Kit Harrington\u2019s fan club, this was not the bit the audience connected with. Even the gripping \u201cyoung leader comes of age\u201d stories that Dany had in the first and third seasons were second fiddle to the war between the Starks and the Lannisters. The Red Wedding was a brilliant solution to the corner that author George R.R. Martin had written himself into.\n\nTwice Martin has taken an obvious plot thread and\u2026well, beheaded it. First, \u201cNed\u2019s going to uncover the Lannisters\u2019 treachery and then fight off the zombies and those crazy Targaryans\u2026oooh.\u201d Then, \u201cOk, Robb is going to avenge Ned, uncover the Lannisters\u2019 treachery and then\u2026well\u2026dammit, Martin, stop toying with me!\u201d\n\nBut while there is a certain boldness and brilliance to saying \u201cthe good guys don\u2019t win,\u201d there has to be a satisfying conclusion or those were the wrong decisions. Readers of the books (of which I am not one) have suggested that the meandering nature of the later books gives some credence to that fear.\n\nWithout the moral clarity of the Starks\u2019 revenge, who are we to relate to?\n\nHere Be Dragons\n\nMartin\u2019s A Song of Ice and Fire book series is famously unfinished, and as each TV season passes seems no closer to drawing to a conclusion. If the show stays on pace, and Martin off it, they will run out of material by Season 6.\n\nThis is a tremendous gamble on HBO\u2019s part, as the show is undeniably expensive. Its estimated budget is $6 million an episode, with certain showpiece episodes going as high as $10 million. The show requires a phenomenal number of visual effects, from the obvious dragons and zombies to the less obvious crowd scenes and backgrounds. Also, the actors are gaining industry attention, with Harrington and Emilia Clarke both stepping into Hollywood. This will surely become a salary issue at some point.\n\nThen there is the much-discussed aging of the children. With a year between each season, characters that began as children are now played by actors who are clearly young adults. This is particularly problematic for Isaac Hempsted-Wright (Bran Stark) and the spectacular Maisie Williams (Arya Stark), both of whom are meant to be pre-pubescent and are clearly not.\n\nA Dream of Spring\n\nIf there is hope to be had, it is that Benioff and Weiss have proven to be proficient in adapting and in some ways even improving on Martin\u2019s work. Many of their most heralded scenes do not exist in the books and show an ability to get into the heads of these characters beyond the printed page.\n\nIt is not unreasonable to think that they could breathe life and clarity into some of the less inspiring sections of the plot. And should it prove necessary for them to complete the saga themselves (as they famously have a contingency plan for), they seem to be capable stewards.\n\nRelated: \u2018Netflix Bitch\u2019 \u2014The New King of Content Is Getting Cocky\n\nWe also shouldn\u2019t underestimate Martin himself, who spent a lot of the \u201880s and \u201890s working in television. He has a remarkable facility with the medium and its genres, which he has displayed in the scripts he\u2019s written for the show. Think of the cop show that was Ned Stark\u2019s story. Or the weird buddy comedies of Jamie and Brienne or Tywin and Arya, the horror stories north of the wall and the torture porn of Ramsay Bolton.\n\nMost importantly, he gets soap operas. Arya Stark can\u2019t ever get home, because if she does she\u2019s just a little girl again. She won\u2019t have more adventures. Like the castaways on \u201cGilligan\u2019s Island,\u201d it\u2019s not important that she get home, it\u2019s important that she keep trying\u2026so we can have more episodes.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Caveat: If you haven\u2019t seen Season 3 of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d by now, you have no one t", "title": "\u2018Game of Thrones\u2019: Can HBO\u2019s Juggernaut Maintain Its Momentum?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/04/04/Game-Thrones-Can-HBO-s-Juggernaut-Maintain-Its-Momentum", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Game_Of_Thrones04042014_08.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/04/04/Game-Thrones-Can-HBO-s-Juggernaut-Maintain-Its-Momentum", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Game_Of_Thrones04042014_08.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@DrMonkeyPHD"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Caveat: If you haven\u2019t seen Season 3 of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d by now, you have no one t", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde588\"", "article_summary": "Caveat: If you haven\u2019t seen Season 3 of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d by now, you have no one to blame but yourself.\nWeiss will be able to recreate the magic that gave \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d a breakout season in 2013.\nArya Stark can\u2019t ever get home, because if she does she\u2019s just a little girl again.\nRelated: 12 Big Numbers Behind \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019Through it all, there\u2019s no question that Thrones maintains its hold on pop culture.\nThe Honeymoon Is OverSince its very first scene, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d has had one glaring problem."}
