James Harrison, who\u2019s nearing his 80s, has been donating blood throughout his entire life \u2014 ultimately saving the lives of over two million people.\n\nWhen Harrison was 14, he fell ill \u2014 and along with having a lung removed, he received nearly 2 gallons of blood from strangers, which saved his life. After that experience, he knew he wanted to do something similar to give back.\n\n\"After the operation\u2026 I was talking to my father naturally,\" Harrison told ABC News, \"and he, being a blood donor, went through and said. 'You know, my life had been saved by 13 litres of blood by people that we didn\u2019t know,' and I said well, at that time probably a throwaway line, 'As soon as I\u2019m 18 I will become a blood donor.' And two days after I turned 18, I became a donor and I\u2019ve been donating for 60 years now.\"\n\nHarrison began giving blood and plasma every three weeks for 11 years. And his blood was special because it contained a rare antibody called Rh (D) immune globulin, or anti-D.\n\nThe Rh blood group system is one of 35 blood group systems in humans, and the most important after ABO. In pregnant women who have Rh-negative blood and whose babies have Rh-positive blood, the mother\u2019s immune system treats Rh-positive fetal cells as a foreign substance. The mother\u2019s immune system then sends anti-Rh antibodies through the placenta to destroy the baby\u2019s red blood cells \u2014 resulting in an often fatal disease.\n\nThis is where Harrison\u2019s anti-D comes in handy. It\u2019s an antibody that is able to save the life of the fetus by turning off the mother\u2019s immune response to attack the baby\u2019s red blood cells. Since he began donating blood, he has saved some two million babies, according to the Australian Red Cross.\n\n\u201cThere was a disease called Hemolytic disease of the newborn, and essentially there were lots of women who were losing their babies or their babies were being born with brain damage or severe anaemia, and so doctors discovered that James\u2019 antibody could actually prevent Hemolytic disease of the newborn,\u201d Jemma Falkenmire, a spokeswoman for the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, told ABC News.\n\nAccording to the American Red Cross, someone in the U.S. needs blood every two seconds, and over 41,000 blood donations are needed every day. Aside from people suffering from traumatic injuries, sickle cell and cancer patients require long-term blood transfusions. Even though 38 percent of Americans are eligible to donate blood, only 10 percent of that number does so annually.\n\nHarrison\u2019s family members have followed in his footsteps and become prolific donors, too. But he urges regular people to do the same: What do you have to lose?\n\n\u201cSome people say, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re a hero,\u2019\u201d Harrison told NPR. \u201cBut I\u2019m in a safe room, donating blood. They give me a cup of coffee and something to nibble on. And then I just go on my way \u2026No problem, no hardship.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "james harrison, donating blood, man with the golden arm", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "An Australian man serves as an inspiration to ordinary people who can donate blood and save the lives of others.", "title": "'Man With The Golden Arm' Donates Blood To Save 2 Million Babies", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/man-golden-arm-rare-blood-type-allows-james-harrison-donate-blood-2-million-babies-338416", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/16/drawing-blood.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An Australian man serves as an inspiration to ordinary people who can donate blood and save the lives of others.", "title": "'Man With The Golden Arm' Donates Blood To Save 2 Million Babies", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/man-golden-arm-rare-blood-type-allows-james-harrison-donate-blood-2-million-babies-338416", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/16/drawing-blood.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/16/drawing-blood.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-06-16T11:58:25-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-16T11:58:23-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "An Australian man serves as an inspiration to ordinary people who can donate blood and save the lives of others."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd375\"", "article_summary": "James Harrison, who\u2019s nearing his 80s, has been donating blood throughout his entire life \u2014 ultimately saving the lives of over two million people.\nDonating blood only takes about an hour, but it can save dozens of lives.\nSince he began donating blood, he has saved some two million babies, according to the Australian Red Cross.\nIn pregnant women who have Rh-negative blood and whose babies have Rh-positive blood, the mother\u2019s immune system treats Rh-positive fetal cells as a foreign substance.\n\"After the operation\u2026 I was talking to my father naturally,\" Harrison told ABC News, \"and he, being a blood donor, went through and said."}
