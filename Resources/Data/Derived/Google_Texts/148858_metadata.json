Steve Rembelski of Challis was chosen as the new executive director, not for his local connections but for his experience dealing with federal regulations. Rembelski, who grew up on a Pahsimeroi Valley ranch, started a six-week transition period with Taylor March 30 and officially takes over May 13. Taylor is sharing knowledge gained through her 18 years of experience. Rembelski served as bank manager for Wells Fargo Bank in Challis and most recently was regional manger of Ireland Bank based in Mackay, where he oversaw seven Idaho branches. He was selected from among 25 applicants in a nationwide search, Taylor said. North Custer Hospital District Board (NCHD) members interviewed the top candidates, including Rembelski. Transition Taylor has been on the job since April 1998 and jokes she's talking fast to transfer her knowledge of the industry and clinic to Rembelski during the transition. \"I am excited,\" Taylor said. \"I think Steve is going to do a great job.\" Rembelski is looking forward to not having his daily Challis-Mackay commute. Having the opportunity to stay at home with his family in his own community is a big plus. He and wife Lani, the principal of Challis Elementary School, have three children: Justin, 16, Chelestina, 14, and Alexandra, 11. Rembelski and brother Ron, who works at Custer Telephone Cooperative, were raised with their siblings on Double Springs Ranch in upper Pahsimeroi Valley. \"I'm excited to hand this over to someone who understands and shares my commitment to the program and its long term success,\" Taylor said. \"This clinic is an integral part of the community,\" Rembelski said, \"and is key to its viability. Kate's done a swell job of dedicating her life to keeping this going. Hers are big shoes to fill.\" Audits, site visits and privacy regulations are similar in banking and health care, Rembelski and Taylor agreed, as are financial reporting and oversight. \"He's well into the learning curve already.\" This will be key for Challis to keep its status as a Community Health Center (CHC) and a substantial federal grant, which is allowing the clinic to expand services and go from two to four providers, Taylor said. Rembelski's first task will be to bring Athena Health, named after the Greek goddess of wisdom, an electronic patient health record system, online at the clinic. It will take 12-15 weeks to get her going. Patients and providers will be able to securely access records from the Cloud, the clinic, home or anywhere they have an Internet connection. This could help save lives. Imagine a physician assistant accessing your records and treating or stabilizing you at home with help from the Challis ambulance crew. \"Our hope is that it will really expand the primary care services we provide,\" Taylor said. With more patient information on prescriptions and past medical history at the fingertips of the provider, the better treatment will be. \"That will enhance the quality of care for the community.\" Challis is now one of 15 CHCs statewide and is the only one in central Idaho. As a member of the Idaho Primary Care Association (IPCA), Challis now has a louder voice in Boise, since IPCA has a policy director who tracks legislation that affects CHCs and lobbies legislators on the association's behalf. For example, the policy director has researched how Idaho can best serve the underserved, the 78,000 residents in the Medicaid Gap who don't qualify for Medicaid or for health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Providers The other transition, from Rural Health Clinic to CHC, is going well, Taylor said. Financial reporting software is in place, almost ready to go, and the clinic has sent a report to the federal government on how it plans to meet the health care needs of the community. The clinic was awarded a $650,000, three-year federal grant in August, which has allowed the hiring of Physician Assistants Danny Fife and Chad Banks to join Nurse Practitioner Janett Merrell. Fife starts on the job May 30 and Banks in June. A fourth health care provider is still being recruited. Dr. Richard Paris remains medical director, a job he's had since August 1999. When all four providers are on board, they will rotate duties between the clinic, on call for emergencies (with the ambulance and around NCHD) and days off. Such a schedule will go a long way toward preventing provider burnout, which has been a problem with just two providers working at the clinic. Eventually, the clinic's expansion to CHC status will allow mental health care and preventative dental care to be added to the primary care already offered. As a CHC, eligible patients pay on a sliding scale based on income and number of people in their household. \"The grant has been a godsend and has helped the clinic maintain its economic viability and expand providers and services,\" Taylor said. \"It's really about expanding services to meet the needs of the community,\" Rembelski said. \"The guiding principal is to take our time and set up all programs right the first time,\" Taylor said. \"We're responsible for a very important project.\" So far the transition hasn't increased patient numbers. The clinic's patient load has held steady despite cutbacks at Thompson Creek Mine. Hiring Kathy Piva, who chaired the ad-hoc committee, said she and fellow NCHD members looked long and hard to find Taylor's successor, and she didn't expect it to be Rembelski. She thought they might hire someone from Idaho, perhaps an administrator from St. Luke's or St. Alphonsus in Boise who might want to get away from politics and the big city and come to life in the slower lane of Challis. All top three candidates were good, Piva said, but Rembelski stood out as the strongest applicant due to his experience in meeting quarterly deadlines for federal financial reporting. That will be the key to Challis keeping its federal grant and CHC status. Administratively, Rembelski and Taylor speak the same language. Although neither started with a medical background, both have the administrative talents needed to make the Challis clinic succeed. Rembelski was hired not for his close family ties to Challis but primarily for his talents, Piva said. That said, it doesn't hurt that Steve and Lani Rembelski are more likely to retire here, providing longevity and continuity in their respective jobs. Piva expects both the clinic and the community to thrive under the Community Health Center model, its expanded services and four instead of two health care providers. She has a lot of family in the Challis area and feels good about their staying, given the improving mental and physical health care available locally.", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "Challis clinic hires new executive directorSteve Rembelski and Kate Taylor Challis Area Health Center (CAHC) has hired a native son to succeed longtime Administrator Kate Taylor.\nAlthough neither started with a medical background, both have the administrative talents needed to make the Challis clinic succeed.\nShe has a lot of family in the Challis area and feels good about their staying, given the improving mental and physical health care available locally.\nSteve Rembelski of Challis was chosen as the new executive director, not for his local connections but for his experience dealing with federal regulations.\nHe and wife Lani, the principal of Challis Elementary School, have three children: Justin, 16, Chelestina, 14, and Alexandra, 11."}
