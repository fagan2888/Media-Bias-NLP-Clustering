A Duke Beardsley painting fetches a pretty penny on the open market. So did the one he donated to Memories in the Making.

Tom O’Donnell, who chaired the event’s steering committee with Don Bechter and was one of 11 Silver Table sponsors, paid $13,250 for Beardsley’s “High Plains Memories” and its companion piece, “Horses,” by Lola Hawthorne.

Memories in the Making is the signature fundraiser for the Alzheimer’s Association of Colorado and brought 600 people to the Hyatt Regency Tech Center on June 13 for a silent auction, dinner and the grand finale, where a dozen works by professional artists were paired with watercolors done by individuals with Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias and then sold to the highest bidder by auctioneers Chuck and Bryson Miller.

“Those paintings offer a glimpse into lives well-lived,” noted mistress of ceremonies Kim Christiansen of 9News. “They illustrate a special memory, a pet you may not have known about or a trip the artist may have taken before Alzheimer’s or dementia set in.”

Many of them, she added, had never painted before but were able to express thoughts and emotions when given a brush and canvas.

In addition to Beardsley, 30 other professional artists donated their time and talent, including John Fielder, Laurie Maves, Cheryl St. John, Marin Dobson and Anne Aguirre.

Guests included steering committee members Melanie Backes and Julie Wham; Sarah Lorance, chair of the chapter board of directors, and her husband, Michael; Colleen and John Maxfield; Norma and Dick Auer; Barbara and Lee Mendel; and Donna and Gary Antonoff.

Also, Dr. Jamison Miller; Melinda Quiat; Ali and Adam Duerr; Zodie and Jim Livingston; Kristy Tochihara; JJ Jordan; Linda and Chris Binkley; Amy Winter; Kathy and Tim VanMeter; and Leslie Liedtke.
