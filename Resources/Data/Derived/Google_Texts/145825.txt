CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Last week, Cleveland's ship finally came in, carrying the 2016 Republican Convention and Akron's favorite son, NBA icon LeBron James.

Maybe Lebron's a republican now, and just wants to play with fellow 1 percenter Mitt Romney in 2016 at the Q.

Now that King James is again occupying his once vacant Akron/Cleveland throne, Clint Eastwood will have to find another empty chair to speak to at the convention.

Will Obamacare cover treatments for welts from Clevelander's pinching themselves to make sure they just haven't been dreaming?

The ghosts of John D. Rockefeller and Art Modell appeared on the SyFy channel to say that they also would return to Cleveland if they could.

James isn't just a returning NBA MVP, he's a returning economic MVP. He's a walking economic boom. Cleveland's not just the Rock 'n' Roll capital, it's now the t-shirt capital. The rust belt has been covered over by 100% cotton "Forgiveness" and "FOR6IVEN" tees. The "Mistake on the Lake" is now "Cha-Ching on the Lake".

In his great essay in Sports Illustrated, James wrote, "I want kids in Northeast Ohio, like the hundreds of Akron third-graders I sponsor through my foundation, to realize that there's no better place to grow up..." Thanks to Lebron James and the Republican Convention returning to Cleveland, kids and adults all over the country will soon discover the hidden gem, that Lebron and we, have always known Northeast Ohio to be.
