Judge says Ohio woman can collect damages from ex-husband for domestic violence

An Ohio woman can collect damages from her ex-husband over a domestic violence incident that occurred in 2013, while the couple was still married, a state-court judge has ruled.

Jerry Bailey is liable to Jennifer Bailey for a beating in their Franklin County home in which her facial bones were fractured, said Common Pleas Judge Julie Lynch in a Wednesday written decision.

A magistrate judge will now preside over a trial to determine the amount of compensatory and punitive damages that should be awarded, the Columbus Dispatch reports.

The judge’s ruling in the unusual case “sets a clear legal precedent that these victims are going to have recourse to a meaningful remedy,” said her lawyer, Michael King. “Whether Jennifer Bailey ever collects a dollar or not, that makes this decision huge.”
