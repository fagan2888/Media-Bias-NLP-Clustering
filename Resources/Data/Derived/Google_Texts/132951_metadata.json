That the hack included terrorist threats and was focused on causing major corporate damage, rather than on stealing customer information for fraud like in the breaches at Home Depot and Target, indicates a whole new frontier has emerged in cybersecurity. Suddenly every major company could be the target of cyberextortion.\n\n\u201cThe Sony breach is a real wake-up call even after the year of mega-breaches we\u2019ve seen,\u201d says Lee Weiner, Boston security firm Rapid7\u2019s senior vice president of products and engineering. \u201cThis is a completely different type of data stolen with the aim to harm the company.\u201d\n\nThis should signal to all U.S. businesses that they need to \u201ctake cybersecurity as serious as physical security of their employees or security of their physical facilities,\u201d says Cynthia Larose, chair of the privacy and security practice at the law firm Mintz Levin in Boston.\n\nThe breach is particularly troubling in Hollywood, where secrecy is supposed to be paramount to insure that movie secrets worth millions don\u2019t get leaked.\n\n\u201cMovie studios have, by and large, behaved as high-security intellectual property purveyors; prints have been tightly controlled, screeners are watermarked, and bootleggers are prosecuted wherever possible,\u201d says Seth Shapiro, a professor at the University of Southern California\u2019s School of Cinematic Arts. He said that\u2019s what makes it so surprising that email leaks showed that Sony executives apparently gave out passwords in unencrypted emails and made other security blunders.\n\n\u201cThe apparently laxity of Sony IT security \u2014 given the history of prior hacks \u2014 is unprecedented in the history of media technology,\u201d he says. Sony Corp.\u2019s PlayStation network was hacked in 2011.\n\nStudios are trying to tighten up procedures in the wake of the Sony attack. Warner Bros. executives earlier this week ordered a company-wide password reset and sent a five-point security checklist to employees advising them to purge their computers of any unnecessary data, in an email seen by The Associated Press. \u201cKeep only what you need for business purposes,\u201d the message said.\n\nEven so, some say there is little that corporations can do to prevent such a sophisticated cyberattack. The key may lie more in detection and limiting damage.\n\n\u201cThere are very few companies that can withstand that kind of large assault,\u201d says Rich Mogull, an analyst with security firm Securosis in Phoenix. \u201cBut a lot of companies do need to improve what they\u2019re doing on security, I see it every day with companies I work with.\u201d\n\nCompanies also need to invest in identifying vulnerabilities on their networks and work quickly to address them. Jonathan Sander, strategy and research officer at data security firm Stealthbits in Hawthorne, N.J., recommends undertaking a comprehensive review to ensure outdated files, such as digital copies of old contracts and electronic conversations that occurred years ago, are no longer being stored on the corporate networks.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of stuff just sitting there waiting to be taken and used for the kind of thing that has happened at Sony right now,\u201d Sander says.\n\nHe says the Sony breach has been coming up in every customer meeting that Stealthbits Technologies had held since the stolen information began leaking out and making international headlines earlier this month.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Companies\u2019 data security in question after Sony hack", "title": "Companies\u2019 data security in question after Sony hack", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Companies\u2019 data security in question after Sony hack", "title": "Companies\u2019 data security in question after Sony hack", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/19/companies_data_security_in_question_after_sony_hack/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/sony-hack-companies-on-alert.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Companies\u2019 data security in question after Sony hack", "title": "Companies\u2019 data security in question after Sony hack", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/sony-hack-companies-on-alert.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mae Anderson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThere are very few companies that can withstand that kind of large assault,\u201d says Rich Mogull, an analyst with security firm Securosis in Phoenix.\n\u201cThe Sony breach is a real wake-up call even after the year of mega-breaches we\u2019ve seen,\u201d says Lee Weiner, Boston security firm Rapid7\u2019s senior vice president of products and engineering.\nHe says the Sony breach has been coming up in every customer meeting that Stealthbits Technologies had held since the stolen information began leaking out and making international headlines earlier this month.\n\u201cThe apparently laxity of Sony IT security \u2014 given the history of prior hacks \u2014 is unprecedented in the history of media technology,\u201d he says.\nJonathan Sander, strategy and research officer at data security firm Stealthbits in Hawthorne, N.J., recommends undertaking a comprehensive review to ensure outdated files, such as digital copies of old contracts and electronic conversations that occurred years ago, are no longer being stored on the corporate networks."}
