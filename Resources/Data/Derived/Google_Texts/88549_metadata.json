That\u2019s among the worst performers of co-ops operating in 23 states last year.\n\nMeritus vice president Veronica Piotrowski disputed the enrollment figures in the federal government report, saying the company had 3,500 enrollees in November. The government stands by its numbers.\n\nRegardless, she said enrollment has since soared and the insurer now covers nearly 56,000 Arizonans. Most of those bought their policies on the federal health insurance marketplace, boosting Meritus\u2019 marketplace share from less than 2 percent last year to 28 percent now.\n\nA March report from the Government Accountability Office said most co-op plans with lower-than-expected enrollment blamed high premiums for their performance, and its analysis showed Meritus insurance plans last year were among the most expensive sold in the state.\n\nPiotrowski also blamed the poor start on the uncertainly with the federal government\u2019s health insurance exchange and the public\u2019s unfamiliarity with the company, created using a $93 million federal loan. Most of that loan was used to created reserves.\n\nThe company lowered prices on many plans for this year\u2019s open enrollment period and it is now more well-known, she said.\n\n\u201cWe really felt that as we progressed that we had a product that was more widely known, Meritus was becoming more familiar to the community,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we have attractive pricing. That was also part of that recipe that really made us an attractive and valuable selection for the community.\u201d\n\nThe Tempe-based company offers HMO and PPO plans on the federal marketplace and in the private market. Its plans include so-called \u201cnarrow networks\u201d with limited providers and broad networks with large choices among hospitals and doctors.\n\nAccording to enrollment numbers provided by the Arizona Department of Insurance, Meritus had only 2 percent of the market last year, based on its enrollment and nearly 100,000 plans sold on the federal exchange. Based on numbers Piotrowski provided Friday, that has soared to nearly 30 percent of the 165,000 people who bought marketplace plans for 2015.\n\n\u201cI think the story is we\u2019ve more than doubled even what that projection was,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve exceeded our targets through this part of the year as well, so we\u2019re really pleased with that.\u201d\n\nThe federal audit showed Meritus lost $7.2 million last year, but projected a small profit this year and earnings of $3 million in 2016.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The nonprofit co-op health insurance plan created in Arizona to provide competition to traditional insurance companies under the Affordable Care Act has seen enrollment soar above projections after a dismal 2014 start that was highlighted in a recent federal audit.", "generator": "WordPress", "author": "Bob Christie, Associated Press", "og": {"site_name": "Arizona Capitol Times", "description": "The nonprofit co-op health insurance plan created in Arizona to provide competition to traditional insurance companies under the Affordable Care Act has seen enrollment soar above projections after...", "title": "Arizona's health insurance co-op sees enrollment soar", "url": "http://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2015/08/04/arizonas-health-insurance-co-op-sees-enrollment-soar/", "image": "http://azcapitoltimes.com/files/2015/08/meritus.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Arizona\u2019s health insurance co-op sees enrollment soarArizona Capitol Times", "msvalidate.01": "118D5E2D5722A6F1A827250C4D8CEC95", "keywords": "arizona, health insurance co-op, meritus, enrollment increase, affordable care act, obamacare, federal audit, health and human services department's inspector general, veronica piotrowski, enrollees, hmo and ppo plans,affordable care act,enrollees,enrollment increase,federal audit,health and human services department's inspector general,health insurance co-op,hmo and ppo plans,meritus,obamacare,veronica piotrowski", "google-site-verification": "yBUjZkZhQp3gSLHDjf3ORiAV2B17Yp4XZVxbpx8h4_M", "y_key": "7be161f96cdbc5bc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0bc9\"", "article_summary": "Most of those bought their policies on the federal health insurance marketplace, boosting Meritus\u2019 marketplace share from less than 2 percent last year to 28 percent now.\nThe nonprofit co-op health insurance plan created in Arizona to provide competition to traditional insurance companies under the Affordable Care Act has seen enrollment soar above projections after a dismal 2014 start that was highlighted in a recent federal audit.\nA March report from the Government Accountability Office said most co-op plans with lower-than-expected enrollment blamed high premiums for their performance, and its analysis showed Meritus insurance plans last year were among the most expensive sold in the state.\nPiotrowski also blamed the poor start on the uncertainly with the federal government\u2019s health insurance exchange and the public\u2019s unfamiliarity with the company, created using a $93 million federal loan.\nBased on numbers Piotrowski provided Friday, that has soared to nearly 30 percent of the 165,000 people who bought marketplace plans for 2015."}
