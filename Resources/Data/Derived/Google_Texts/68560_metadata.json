Both are extremely wealthy, both have made sizable contributions to the American economic and innovative spheres, and both are staunch progressives who have worked together on many initiative in the past, such as Mr. Gates\u2019s foundation, and Mr. Buffett\u2019s Giving Pledge. But, add the famously conservative casino-magnate Sheldon Adelson into the mix, and you\u2019ve got an unlikely partnership, indeed.\n\nThe trio nonetheless came together today to pen an Op-Ed column on immigration reform for The New York Times. Acknowledging their vast ideological differences, and even the slight differences in their respective approaches to immigration policy, Mr. Buffett, Mr. Gates and Mr. Adelson write, \u201cWe could without doubt combine to draft a bill acceptable to each of us. We hope that fact holds a lesson: You don\u2019t have to agree on everything in order to cooperate on matters about which you are reasonably close to agreement. It\u2019s time this brand of thinking finds its way to Washington.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost Americans believe that our country has a clear and present interest in enacting immigration legislation that is both humane to immigrants living here and a contribution to the well-being of our citizens,\u201d they write. \u201cMany of these people, of course, want to return to their home country \u2013 and that\u2019s fine. But for those who wish to stay and work in computer science or technology, fields badly in need of their services, let\u2019s roll out the welcome mat.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn honor of this historic meeting of the minds, here is a brief history of conservative thinkers, lawmakers, and commentators coming forward and supporting immigration reform.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140711123148, "twitter": {"description": "Conservative thinkers, lawmakers, and commentators have often come forward in support of immigration reform.", "title": "A Brief History of Pro-Immigrant Conservatism", "url": "http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/11/a-brief-history-of-pro-immigrant-conservatism/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@nytopinion", "card": "summary"}, "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Jake Flanagin", "org": "Customs and Border Protection (US)", "keywords": "Beck Glenn,Bush George,Bush Jeb,Hannity Sean,Norquist Grover G,Reagan Ronald Wilson,Conservatism (US Politics),Illegal Immigration,Customs and Border Protection (US),Roundup", "GBLC": "Roundup", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/op-talk/A Brief History of Pro-Immigrant Conservatism ( 20140711 )", "description": "Conservative thinkers, lawmakers, and commentators have often come forward in support of immigration reform.", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Jake Flanagin", "SCG": "op-talk", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/optalk", "per": "Beck, Glenn;Bush, George;Bush, Jeb;Hannity, Sean;Norquist, Grover G;Reagan, Ronald Wilson", "byl": "Jake Flanagin", "BN": "op-talk", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/op-talk/post", "news_keywords": "Conservatism in the United States,George Bush,Glenn Beck,Grover G Norquist,Illegal Immigration,Jeb Bush,Ronald Reagan,Sean Hannity", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "July 11, 2014", "article": {"section": "Opinion", "tag": "Roundup", "published_time": 1405096308, "modified_time": "2014-07-11T16:31:48-04:00", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp"}, "utime": 20140711163148, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140711, "pdate": 20140711, "des": "Conservatism (US Politics);Illegal Immigration", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Op-Talk", "description": "Conservative thinkers, lawmakers, and commentators have often come forward in support of immigration reform.", "title": "A Brief History of Pro-Immigrant Conservatism", "url": "http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/11/a-brief-history-of-pro-immigrant-conservatism/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/11/a-brief-history-of-pro-immigrant-conservatism/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "A Brief History of Pro-Immigrant Conservatism", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "July 11, 2014"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8556\"", "article_summary": "The trio nonetheless came together today to pen an Op-Ed column on immigration reform for The New York Times.\nWarren Buffett and Bill Gates don\u2019t seem like such an unlikely pair.\nBut, add the famously conservative casino-magnate Sheldon Adelson into the mix, and you\u2019ve got an unlikely partnership, indeed.\n\u201cMany of these people, of course, want to return to their home country \u2013 and that\u2019s fine.\nBut for those who wish to stay and work in computer science or technology, fields badly in need of their services, let\u2019s roll out the welcome mat.\u201dIn honor of this historic meeting of the minds, here is a brief history of conservative thinkers, lawmakers, and commentators coming forward and supporting immigration reform."}
