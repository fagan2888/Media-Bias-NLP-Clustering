That is the debate as we watch the extremist militants of ISIS rampage through Syria and Iraq with the intent of establishing a caliphate that erases the borders between the two.\n\nMany members of Congress are fully committed to a bombing campaign. \u201cThe threat ISIS poses only grows over time,\u201d Senators McCain and Graham wrote in Sunday\u2019s New York Times. \u201cIt cannot be contained. It must be confronted\u2026. Such a strategy would require our commander in chief to explain to war-weary Americans why we cannot ignore this threat.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama, who has always stood among the war-weary, wavers per usual. Pope Francis just came out in favor, saying a counter-attack on ISIS falls under the \u201cjust war\u201d doctrine.\n\nRelated: Obama Hammered on Ukraine, ISIS Delays\n\nNew York Times columnist David Brooks said on NPR Friday that we had better accept that going in with bombs\u2014which he favors, and on both sides of the Iraq-Syria border\u2014will eventually require sending special-operations forces, if not ground troops. \u201cThe irony of the Obama administration, it\u2019s going to get a lot more militarized in the last two years,\u201d Brooks told the hosts of All Things Considered.\n\nPolicy wonks generally favor bombing, but cautiously so and there are straight-out objectors on the left. John Feffer argues in Foreign Policy in Focus, \u201cIf the United States doesn\u2019t do something stupid\u2014like bombing this newly declared caliphate and its army\u2014ISIS will likely be consumed by the fires of its own extremism. It\u2019s best to remind the administration that ISIS is like one of those creatures in a horror movie that only grows stronger the more drone strikes or artillery shells that it absorbs.\u201d\n\nThere is a lot to support this position. We have a nine-year war in Iraq behind us and a 13-year war in Afghanistan still to wind down. In front of us, we have the Afghan would-be nation that may or may not end up incorporating the Taliban in its government, and Iraq in sectarian smithereens sprouting the most grotesque flower of evil yet to come out of the region\u2019s arc of crisis.\n\nRelated: The Key to Solving Both ISIS and Russian Aggression\n\nWe all remember the high-school chemistry experiments with mercury. Are we about to take a hammer to a spoonful of it and, paradoxically, shatter the element in a thousand pieces even as it remains intact? Thirteen years after the September 11 attacks, we cannot ignore this question.\n\nWith these thoughts in mind, this column is a modest contribution to the conversation, and excellent it is we are having it. Yes, we have to bomb. But there is way more to this than a short answer.\n\nFirst of all, we have to distinguish between a quick, sharp bombing campaign with a limited, clearly defined objective and another open-ended intervention. The latter course would have us doing more mercury experiments in no time.\n\nThomas Reese, a Jesuit and a good papal interpreter, said this in his piece in the National Catholic Reporter last week: \u201cFrancis was very careful in what he said and what he did not say. In saying, \u2018It is licit to stop the unjust aggressor,\u2019 he said, \u2018stop,\u2019 not \u2018destroy,\u2019 \u2018conquer,\u2019 \u2018push back,\u2019 or \u2018defeat.\u2019 Stop, only that and nothing more.\u201d\n\nRelated: What ISIS Really Wants (Besides Your Head)\n\nYou can take or leave this as teaching, but it happens to be good foreign policy. Reese added, \u201cThis limited goal will not please the hawks.\u201d He is right, but there is plenty of history around to counter them.\n\nSecond, let\u2019s fasten onto a sub-theme among those favoring a bombing campaign. \u201cThis requires a comprehensive strategy, presidential leadership, and a far greater sense of urgency,\u201d McCain and Graham wrote Sunday. \u201cIf Mr. Obama changes course and adopts a strategic approach to defeat ISIS, he deserves support.\u201d\n\nIn her much-noted interview in The Atlantic a few weeks ago, Hillary Clinton spoke about militant Islam as a question to be understood comprehensively. \u201cHistory never stops and nationalisms were going to assert themselves, and then other variations on ideologies were going to claim their space,\u201d Clinton told Jeffrey Goldberg. \u201cObviously, jihadi Islam is the prime example.\u201d\n\nIn the same exchange, Clinton spoke about \u201csmart power,\u201d meaning American engagement but not necessarily American military engagement. All good. What would \u201ca comprehensive strategy\u201d and \u201csmart power\u201d look like in the case of ISIS, then?\n\nRelated: Feinstein Takes Obama to Task for Caution on ISIS\n\nI find the answer in the twilit months between the September 11 attacks and George W. Bush\u2019s Axis of Evil speech to Congress the following January. Alert readers will recall this unusual period. The task was to connect militant Islam to the countless deprivations afflicting the Middle East: Poverty, the absence of everything from democratic processes to education and clean water made the region a fetid swamp where terrorists hatched like mosquitoes. The talk was of a Marshall Plan to transform it top to bottom, as the original did in postwar Europe.\n\nWe never got there. Instead, we \u201cdecontextualized\u201d terror, to take the term coined by Richard Perle, one of Bush\u2019s noted intellectual supports. \u201cAny attempt to understand terror is an attempt to justify it,\u201d Perle famously argued. \u201cIt simply needs to be fought and destroyed.\n\nTime now to recognize Perle as the original chemistry professor. Events have proven him dead wrong. Terror needs to be fought and destroyed, but not simply.\n\nISIS presents an exceptional case. Bomb it, yes\u2014but as a necessary humanitarian act. A follow-on intervention, out of the question. And we can start the comprehensive strategy McCain and Graham call for with this bit of smart power: The Arab monarchies whom Washington supports and who, in turn, support ISIS and other jihadists can be coerced into spending their millions on a down payment for a new, internationally sponsored Marshall Plan in the Middle East. Much of the region will surely respond favorably.\n\nISIS has given the world a great deal of horror in a very short time. Perversely enough, it also gives us all a moment of opportunity.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "To bomb or not to bomb?", "title": "Even the Pope Wants to Stop ISIS; Shouldn\u2019t Obama?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/09/01/Even-Pope-Wants-Stop-ISIS-Shouldn-t-Obama", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/09012014_Kurdish_Artillery.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/09/01/Even-Pope-Wants-Stop-ISIS-Shouldn-t-Obama", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/09012014_Kurdish_Artillery.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@psmith7600"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "To bomb or not to bomb?", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1bbd\"", "article_summary": "Pope Francis just came out in favor, saying a counter-attack on ISIS falls under the \u201cjust war\u201d doctrine.\n\u201cThe threat ISIS poses only grows over time,\u201d Senators McCain and Graham wrote in Sunday\u2019s New York Times.\n\u201cThe irony of the Obama administration, it\u2019s going to get a lot more militarized in the last two years,\u201d Brooks told the hosts of All Things Considered.\nRelated: The Key to Solving Both ISIS and Russian AggressionWe all remember the high-school chemistry experiments with mercury.\nWhat would \u201ca comprehensive strategy\u201d and \u201csmart power\u201d look like in the case of ISIS, then?"}
