It\u2019s a life phase rooted in the American psyche. Workers look forward to it for years. After 40 or more years of the daily grind of work-life, in retirement we get to relax and do what we want \u2013 be it travel, hobbies or whatever else may move us.\n\nVery few Americans imagine steep medical bills and financial stress when they hear the word \u2013 with the possible exception of those who are nearing this life stage and are worried about paying for medical expenses. Yet, whether you realize it or not, medical care can consume a large portion of your retirement budget.\n\nAccording to the Employee Benefits Research Institute (EBRI), Medicare currently covers roughly 62 percent of an individual\u2019s medical expenses. To make matters worse, EBRI says the percentage covered by Medicare could decrease in the future. With retirees\u2019 share of health care costs rising, it\u2019s more important than ever to plan for these expenses in retirement.\n\nUnfortunately, medical expenses for older adults are often unpredictable, and it can be difficult to arrive at an exact number. Such an amount is dependent upon two relatively unknowable variables: your future health and the future of health care coverage, by Medicare or another means.\n\nHowever, there are some concrete steps you can (and should) take ahead of time to prepare for medical expenses during retirement:\n\n1. Understand some basics about Medicare.\n\nMedicare is similar to a government-sponsored health insurance plan for seniors (presently defined as persons age 65 and older).\n\nSeniors can currently choose whether to be covered by Original Medicare, which is broken into two primary parts (often called Part A and Part B), or a Medicare Advantage Plan. Advantage plans, which are provided by private health insurance companies, are often called Part C and can be more expensive and more comprehensive.\n\nIndividuals who elect Original Medicare can buy a supplemental insurance policy, called Medigap, to fill in some of the coverage differences inherent to Parts A and B. Medigap no longer covers prescription drug gaps.\n\nTo cover prescription drug gaps, Medicare users can pay for Part D, which is the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan.\n\nThere are some prescription drugs and medical services and procedures not covered by Medicare.\n\nLong-term care is not covered under Medicare.\n\n2. Estimate your healthcare costs during retirement.\n\nStart with these numbers: According to a 2011 guide to health care and retirement costs from Merrill Lynch (and based on historical insurance data and actuarial predictions), the average annual out-of-pocket health care cost in 2011 for a 65-year-old in poor health and on Medicare was $4,760. For a healthy 65-year-old on Medicare, the average cost was $4,450. By age 75, the 2011 data shows a marked increase to $5,635 for someone in poor health and $5,220 for someone in excellent health. Bear in mind that these numbers are averages for people on Medicare. A senior with a chronic or long-term illness could pay a lot more out of pocket.\n\nPremiums for Medicare Part B and Part D vary based on income, so add extra premium costs if you anticipate having significant retirement assets.\n\nWorking from these averages, adjust for rising medical costs between 2011 and your projected retirement date. There is a wide divergence of opinion among experts with regard to the yearly rate at which medical costs will increase in the future. Historically, medical costs have outpaced inflation. According to a November 2013 report, \"Trends in Health Care and the Role of The Affordable Care Act,\" released by the White House, the average annual increase in health costs was 4.5 percent from 1965 to 2010.\n\n3. Review your options for paying for healthcare costs in retirement.\n\nAs with other retirement expenses, there are a variety of ways to save, earn or otherwise obtain the funds you\u2019ll need to pay for medical expenses during retirement.\n\nSome employers provide a level of medical coverage after retirement. If you\u2019re nearing retirement, find out whether your employer does this and, if they do, get details about the coverage. If you\u2019re not nearing retirement, you can\u2019t count on your current employer to provide health coverage during those years.\n\nPlan to work part-time during your earlier retirement years so you can limit the amount you withdraw from your retirement accounts. You should also continue to save and invest as much as possible to help pay for future out-of-pocket medical expenses.\n\nIntegrate medical care costs into your overall retirement saving and investing plan. As with other retirement funds, you won\u2019t need all the money on day one. You can remain invested during retirement in order to grow your health care savings. Work with a financial advisor to determine the most appropriate investment strategy for you.\n\nDespite your planning, expect there to be some unknowns related to health care costs during your retirement years. Determining how much to save should come down, in part, to your comfort level and expected medical needs based on your current health and family history. If you\u2019re uncomfortable with the unpredictable nature of future medical costs, you\u2019ll probably feel more at ease with a higher needs estimate \u2013 a better-safe-than-sorry approach may be just what the doctor ordered.", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"150129_CreditCardDebt\",\"text\":\"The average U.S. household has more than $15,000 in credit card debt.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "Golf outings aren't the only expense you should be budgeting for in retirement.", "zone": "blogs/the-smarter-investor/blogentries", "author": "Scott Holsopple", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Golf outings aren't the only expense you should be budgeting for in retirement.", "title": "How to Factor Medical Expenses Into Your Retirement Plan", "url": "http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/the-smarter-mutual-fund-investor/2014/07/08/how-to-factor-medical-expenses-into-your-retirement-plan", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/3c/99/bbfc3a154c90ad211e94e2a807f7/140701-financialcheckup-stock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Golf outings aren't the only expense you should be budgeting for in retirement.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "How to Factor Medical Expenses Into Your Retirement Plan - US News"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "money-news", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "published_at": "2014-07-08", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/22b611c/2147483647/crop/329x329%2B149%2B0/resize/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2F3c%2F99%2Fbbfc3a154c90ad211e94e2a807f7%2Fresizes%2F500%2F140701-financialcheckup-stock.jpg", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "keywords": "investing,money,Medicare,retirement,IRAs,cost of living,personal finance,Scott Holsopple", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2014-07-08"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z263zp", "viewport": "width=980", "news_keywords": "health care, medical costs, Part B, Part D, insurance, employer health care plan, retiree"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0ef9\"", "article_summary": "As with other retirement expenses, there are a variety of ways to save, earn or otherwise obtain the funds you\u2019ll need to pay for medical expenses during retirement.\nWith retirees\u2019 share of health care costs rising, it\u2019s more important than ever to plan for these expenses in retirement.\nUnfortunately, medical expenses for older adults are often unpredictable, and it can be difficult to arrive at an exact number.\nHowever, there are some concrete steps you can (and should) take ahead of time to prepare for medical expenses during retirement:1.\nIntegrate medical care costs into your overall retirement saving and investing plan."}
