Many of the supporters exuded a demeanor similar to Carson himself: calm and deliberative.\n\nThe group of 30 Iowans took their seats in the lobby of the \"Win Ben Win!\" super PAC's office in a shopping center in Johnston, munching on BBQ pulled pork. The group was a picture of diversity, with college students sitting alongside retirees, and several ethnicities and nationalities represented.\n\n\u201cDr. Carson is a great man of integrity and honesty, and we pray that he will shine through tonight,\u201d one woman said, standing in front of the group. \u201cWe\u2019re sending Dr. Carson positive energy as he takes the debate stage tonight,\u201d another said, bowing her head.\n\nJOHNSTON, Iowa -- Minutes before the second Republican debate began on Wednesday, a group of Ben Carson supporters sitting in folding chairs around a small flat-screen TV joined hands and prayed.\n\nAs the summer of Donald Trump draws to an end, Carson is closing the gap on the media mogul in recent polling. A recent Quinnipiac University poll shows Carson in second place; a poll by The Des Moines Register and Bloomberg shows the difference between the two candidates falling within the poll\u2019s margin of error; and a Monmouth University survey of Iowa Republicans has Carson tied with Trump.\n\nVoters here say Carson has both the outsider status and the soft touch -- hitting the campaign trail, holding events in small city halls and banquet halls and getting to know people -- something that appeals to 23-year-old Bryce Williams of West Des Moines. Williams says every Carson event he\u2019s been to has been overflowing with supporters.\n\n\u201cA lot of different ages, a lot of different races, a lot of different people,\u201d Williams said. \u201cA lot of people gravitate towards him. I know people that were Democrats that were there and they were just listening. You might not get that with other candidates.\u201d\n\nCarson\u2019s campaign style is completely different than Trump\u2019s. You won\u2019t find Carson landing a helicopter at the Iowa State Fair; he\u2019s emerging as the anti-Trump, Hartman said.\n\n\u201cThe problem with Donald Trump is he is too much of a bully,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you listen to what Ben Carson says, he says almost the same thing, but in a more intellectual way, and he\u2019s not real loud about it.\u201d\n\nWith the TV volume blaring across the small office, the group watched as Carson remained relaxed, declining to attack the other GOP hopefuls standing beside him -- even after CNN moderators prompted him to do so throughout the evening.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t demean his opposition,\u201d said Heilman during the first commercial break of the debate. \u201cHe won\u2019t run them down. He\u2019s been baited constantly to say something bad about people and he won\u2019t do it.\"\n\nCarson had about 13 minutes of airtime in the primetime debate, but some thought he didn\u2019t have enough of an opportunity to make a splash.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say how Dr. Carson has done, because the CNN format hardly allows him to speak,\u201d Hartman said. \u201cIt\u2019s guided towards those who are way down in the polls.\u201d\n\nThe watch party began to disperse as the debate wore on to its third hour. Many supporters complimented Carson\u2019s performance but faulted CNN\u2019s format and the number of candidates on the stage, saying they seemed to be drowning out his message.\n\n\u201cI think there is always going to be room for improvement,\u201d said Acacia Smith, a 22-year-old student working toward her teaching degree. \u201cI would have liked to see him interject into more \u2026 anytime anybody hears Carson speak, they want to hear more.\u201d\n\nSmith, one of 10 supporters who stayed until the debate\u2019s conclusion, said she didn't think CNN was unfair in any way.\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s hard to distribute fairness when there is that many people out there. You know, everyone is going to be asked a lot of questions,\" Smith said. \"Yes, of course I\u2019m biased. I\u2019d like to hear Carson say more.\u201d\n\nAlso on HuffPost:", "article_metadata": {"description": "But at least there were sides.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-09-18 19:02:32 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "But at least there were sides.", "title": "At Ben Carson Debate Watch Party, Pulled Pork And Plenty Of Awkward Silences", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ben-carson-debate-night-iowa_us_55fb20aee4b08820d917ed00", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/55fb223e2000002600242756.jpeg?cache=1qskrfqhre", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/55fb223e2000002600242756.jpeg?cache=1qskrfqhre", "height": 1000}, "description": "But at least there were sides.", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "At Ben Carson Debate Watch Party, Pulled Pork And Plenty Of Awkward Silences"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-09-17 19:02:32 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_55fb20aee4b08820d917ed00", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "gop debate,2016 election,Republican primary,ben carson,Iowa,win ben win", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "gop debate,2016 election,Republican primary,ben carson,Iowa,win ben win", "published_time": "2015-09-17 19:02:32 -0400", "modified_time": "2015-09-17 22:24:28 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdcba\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019ve been supporting Ben Carson since he first got on the scene in 2013 at the prayer breakfast,\u201d said John Hartman, 77, of Steamboat Rock.\n\u201cA lot of different ages, a lot of different races, a lot of different people,\u201d Williams said.\nI\u2019d like to hear Carson say more.\u201dAlso on HuffPost:\nJOHNSTON, Iowa -- Minutes before the second Republican debate began on Wednesday, a group of Ben Carson supporters sitting in folding chairs around a small flat-screen TV joined hands and prayed.\nThere was no cheering, hooting or hollering from this group as Carson took the stage; just a quick round of applause."}
