He says he hopes he is not the only one who is willing to pick up the baton of freedom.\n\nTed Cruz: Cruz will rescind every illegal and unconstitutional executive action taken by Barack Obama. He will cancel the Iran Deal, move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. His father fled Cuba and he will fight to defend liberty because he knows what it\u2019s like to lose it.\n\nMarco Rubio: He says his parents came to America because it was the only place where people like them could have a chance\u2026 He mentions that his father was a bartender and the the journey from the back of the bar to this debate stage is the essence of the American dream and what makes our country different.

Paul says his position on aid to Israel has not changed.\n\n10: 45: Huckabee on transgenders in the military: He says the military is not a social experiment.

He trusts our enemies and vilifies everyone who disagrees with him.\u201d\n\nHuckabee said the Iran Deal, in which Iran gets everything they want while America did not even get four hostages back, just makes the world more dangerous because Iran has said \u201cwe will wipe Israel off the face of the map and we will bring death to America.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen someone points a gun at your head and loads it, by God you ought to take them seriously,\u201d Huckabee said.\n\n10: 19: Rand Wouldn\u2019t Tear Up Iran Deal on Day One:\n\nPaul says he opposes the Iran Deal, will vote against it.

We have to give more tools to our folks to be able to do that, not fewer, and then trust those people and oversee them to do it the right way. As president, that is exactly what I\u2019ll do.\u201d Rand said he was in favor of getting more records from terrorists and less from innocent Americans.\n\nRand accused Christie of \u201cfundamentally\u201d misunderstanding the Bill of Rights after Christie said, \u201cwhen you\u2019re sitting in a subcommittee, just blowing hot air about this, you can say things like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust President Obama with our records.

Baier notes that Paul said that everything the neocons/hawks have said about foreign policy has been wrong for the last twenty years.

He\u2019s followed by Jeb Bush, who is second in the polls.

Kelly says it would have tough to have had 17 candidates.\n\n8:57 pm: Co-moderator Megyn Kelly admits to being a bit nervous.
