Nasser is 33 years old, his son six. Nasser\u2019s jaw was set and every few moments he glanced over his shoulder to see if anyone was approaching. Until Laith piped up with his question, the only sounds were our footsteps and the wind, against which Nasser was wearing a wool hat and a pleated brown jacket.\n\n\u201cWhy did they take our home?\u201d the little boy asked.\n\n\u201cWhy did they take it? Good question,\u201d replied Nasser, pausing to choose his words carefully. \u201cThey don\u2019t want Palestinians. They don\u2019t want us here.\u201d\n\nLaith was, in fact, asking about something that had happened 29 years ago when his father was a young boy. But he could just as well have been referring to the imminent threat of expulsion facing his family and his community today.\n\nI had spent the previous night with Nasser and his family in their tent on their farmland in Khirbet Susya in the South Hebron Hills of the West Bank. Since 1986, they have have lived there, one-third of a mile from their old home, which is now an Israeli archeological park. Perched on the hill above us is an Israeli settlement built on land occupied by Israel in 1967. That settlement, which is considered illegal under international law, was established in 1983 and is also called Susya. Where we now are, a few hundred meters away across the road, was once Old Susya, the former village of Nasser\u2019s family.\n\nI had mentioned to Nasser earlier that morning that I wanted to see Old Susya. As a foreigner, I could purchase a ticket to the archaeological site and enter without any problem. For Nasser, a Palestinian, it was a different story. He had tried twice to visit the site of the village and cave where he was born without much success, but decided to try again with me. This time he would bring along his six-year old son.\n\nNasser\u2019s parents were born in El-Jaretain, a village in the Naqab desert in what is now Israel. They were pushed out of their home in 1948, during the mass displacement accompanying the founding of that country. After their expulsion from El-Jaretain, they joined relatives who had lived for decades in the ancient caves of Old Susya. A Palestinian village had existed there since at least 1830, when it was first mentioned in written records.\n\nThough his family\u2019s origin is in El-Jaretain, Old Susya is home for Nasser.\n\n\u201cOur village resides in our memory, and I want it to be in our children\u2019s memory, the memory of the children of Susya,\u201d Nasser said, explaining why he decided to bring Laith with him today. \u201cThis is their village, their real village, from which they were expelled in 1986. They have to see it, feel it, remember it, know its features. This is our heritage.\u201d\n\nNasser first attempted to return to Old Susya several years ago, accompanied by his father and an Israeli friend from the human rights organization B\u2019Tselem for which Nasser works. The Israeli army kicked them out, but not before his father was able to show him the cisterns where he had watered his sheep and the cave in which Nasser had been born. A few weeks before my visit, he tried a second time, buying tickets to the archaeological park and briefly getting in. Once again, he told me, Israeli soldiers wouldn\u2019t let him stay. \u201cThey told us Palestinians were not allowed in, that this is a closed area, and kicked us out.\u201d\n\nNasser fully expected to be ejected again, but for some reason, the soldiers stayed in their jeep at the entrance to the site and left us alone.\n\n\u201cWhere is our home?\u201d Laith asked as soon as we were inside.\n\n\u201cYou want to see our home? Okay, I\u2019ll show you,\u201d Nasser replied, taking his young son by the hand and guiding him deeper into the village.\n\n\u201cIs this our house?\u201d Laith asked again moments later with the persistence only a six-year-old can muster.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re coming to it, hold on.\u201d\n\nNasser pointed out the cistern from which their family used to draw water, now covered with iron bars and filled with pigeons. Laith peered inside. \u201cAre these pigeons ours?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, pigeons belong to God.\u201d\n\nNasser stopped walking and stood looking at one particular cave.\n\n\u201cHere?\u201d Laith asked, tugging his father\u2019s arm.\n\nNasser was silent for a moment before replying, \u201cHere.\u201d\n\nHe led his son down stone steps and through a rectangular entrance hewn from white and pink rock. \u201cHere it is,\u201d he said, pausing before entering the dark, damp underground structure. \u201cThis is our cave. My mother gave birth to me here.\u201d\n\nLaith wanted to know if water dripped from the ceiling back then as it does now, if the entrance had been open then, and if there had been electricity in the cave when Nasser was a child. But he had an even more pressing question, one he kept asking throughout the day: \u201cWhy did they take it from us, Daddy?\u201d\n\nExpelled for Life\n\nNasser was only four years old in June 1986 when, after the remains of an ancient synagogue were discovered in Old Susya, Israel\u2019s Civil Administration \u2014 the military body through which it manages the Occupied Palestinian Territories \u2014 declared the village an archaeological site and expropriated it. Nasser doesn\u2019t remember being driven out of the cave in which he was born, but his 70-year old mother, Um Jihad, recalls it vividly.\n\nEach summer during the harvest, the villagers would travel to their agricultural lands to pick figs, olives, and grapes. At the end of the harvest, they would return to Old Susya. One summer, when they tried to go back, she remembers, they found that \u201cthe Israeli army had fenced off the village and locked us out.\u201d Bulldozers had blocked the caves and destroyed their homes.\n\nUm Jihad was determined to retrieve her possessions. She approached the new gate just then being erected. Bedouin Arabs were working on it. \u201cMa\u2019am, you better leave,\u201d she remembers one of them warning her. \u201cThey are going to beat you up.\u201d\n\nUm Jihad knew who \u201cthey\u201d meant. Israelis from the settlement of Susya, backed by the Israeli military, had already taken over the village.\n\n\u201cI will get my belongings even if they shoot me dead,\u201d she replied and returned to her cave, wrapped her possessions in bundles, and carried them one by one back to the gate. By the time she had wrapped her last bundle, the gate was closed and locked and the Bedouin workers had left. She was trapped inside Old Susya with hostile settlers and soldiers. Undaunted, Um Jihad climbed atop a small hill next to the gate and tossed the bundles over one by one. Then she dug a hole beneath the fence and crawled out just as a soldier ran towards her, rifle in hand.\n\n\u201cI was young and fearless back then,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cNow, I scare easily.\u201d\n\nAlong with many of the other 25 families from Old Susya, Um Jihad refused to abandon her land. Instead of moving to the nearby town of Yatta, they settled on their farming and grazing lands, building rough houses or shacks there or moving into caves on that land, and they continued to call their community Susya, or Khirbet Susya.\n\nBut Um Jihad\u2019s problems and those of the rest of her community had only begun. \u201cFrom then on, we lived in constant suffering and harassment,\u201d she told me. \u201cThat Susya settlement is the mother of all our troubles. They keep uprooting our trees. Once one of their bulldozers almost ran me over while flattening the land.\u201d\n\nShe describes several violent incidents the villagers endured at the hands of the settlers. About 15 years ago, she tells me, her cousin Mahmoud, a father of 12, was shot and killed by settlers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Why did they take our home?\" It's a question all too common for families in the Gaza Strip", "title": "\u201cWe lived in constant suffering\u201d: The secret life of a Palestinian refugee", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"Why did they take our home?\" It's a question all too common for families in the Gaza Strip", "title": "\u201cWe lived in constant suffering\u201d: The secret life of a Palestinian refugee", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/13/we_lived_in_constant_suffering_the_secret_life_of_a_palestinian_refugee_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/shutterstock_122493571.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Why did they take our home?\" It's a question all too common for families in the Gaza Strip", "title": "\u201cWe lived in constant suffering\u201d: The secret life of a Palestinian refugee", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/shutterstock_122493571.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jen Marlowe", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Gaza, Israel-Palestine, Palestinian refugees, Refugees, TomDispatch.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "After their expulsion from El-Jaretain, they joined relatives who had lived for decades in the ancient caves of Old Susya.\n\u201cNow, I scare easily.\u201dAlong with many of the other 25 families from Old Susya, Um Jihad refused to abandon her land.\nUndaunted, Um Jihad climbed atop a small hill next to the gate and tossed the bundles over one by one.\nWhere we now are, a few hundred meters away across the road, was once Old Susya, the former village of Nasser\u2019s family.\nAt the end of the harvest, they would return to Old Susya."}
