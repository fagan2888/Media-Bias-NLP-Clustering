What has gone into effect is what the Obama administration has labeled an \u201caccommodation.\u201d But it is not an exemption. Rather, the \u201caccommodation\u201d will, in fact, require that these religious non-profits comply with the health law's mandate.\n\nThe decision for the consolidated cases, Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood v. Sebelius, will determine whether the government can use onerous fines to threaten family businesses, like those run by the Green and Hahn families, to violate their religious beliefs.\n\n[pullquote]\n\nBut the fate of the Obama administration\u2019s so-called \u201caccommodation\u201d for religious non-profits is the subject of other lawsuits that are making their way through the lower courts now.\n\nThe religious organizations that are plaintiffs in the 51 non-profit lawsuits filed so far are diverse in faith backgrounds and in purpose. They include religious hospitals, ministries, colleges and universities\u2014including my alma maters, Franciscan University and the University of Notre Dame\u2014as well as orders of priests and nuns, such as Priests for Life and the Little Sisters of the Poor.\n\nThe fine print of the Obama administration\u2019s \u201caccommodation\u201d for these religious non-profits reveals a bait-and-switch. The very explanation HHS gives in its final rule for how the \u201caccommodation\u201d will work exposes the fallacy of the Obama administration\u2019s claim that under its \u201caccommodation\u201d these religious groups \u201cwould not contract, arrange, pay, or refer for [the coverage that violates its religious beliefs].\u201d HHS notes that \u201cplan participants and beneficiaries\u201d on an accommodated plan do not have \u201ctwo separate health insurance policies.\u201d Rather, the insurance issuer (the insurance company for the religious organization) will make what HHS calls \u201cseparate payments\u201d for the objectionable coverage. Calling them \u201cseparate\u201d does not align with reality.\n\nThese payments are directly linked to the insurance plan they are supposedly separate from. There is no opt-in or opt-out.\n\nThe payments are automatically made for the \u201caccommodated\u201d plan\u2019s participants and beneficiaries and start and end with a person\u2019s enrollment in the \u201caccommodated\u201d plan \u2013 not a moment before and not a moment after. HHS also acknowledges that \u201cissuers typically do not receive enrollee information prior to enrollment.\u201d Put another way, the relationship between the issuer making the \u201cseparate payments\u201d and the plan enrollees is completely dependent on the supposedly \u201caccommodated\u201d organization\u2019s plan.\n\nWhere does the money for the \u201cseparate payments\u201d come from?\n\nIn its final rule, HHS explains that these payments can be envisioned as \u201ccost neutral\u201d for the insurance issuer \u201cbecause they would be insuring the same set of individuals under both the group health insurance policies and [the separate payments].\u201d HHS assumes that providing contraceptive coverage would result in fewer pregnancies and at least equally lowered costs on the \u201caccommodated\u201d group health plan.\n\nOne has to question whether that is true, considering that contraceptive use, as the Obama administration has said in its own talking points, is already ubiquitous. But even accepting HHS\u2019 assumption, the math only works if these contraceptive payments are considered in conjunction with the supposedly separate health plan.\n\nEven self-insured plans cannot avoid participating in the coercive, morally offensive mandate. The \u201caccommodation\u201d requires a self-insured employer to notify a third-party administrator that it objects to this coverage. But in HHS\u2019 own words, \u201cthe self-certification\u2026will be treated as a designation of the third party administrator [to make contraceptive payments].\u201d No means yes.\n\nIt is a clear and intentional fiction to claim that the payments are separate and distinct from the \u201caccommodated\u201d plan and that the employer plays \u201cno role\u201d in the facilitation of and payment for the coverage it objects to.\n\nBoth the family businesses and non-profits challenging the Obama administration\u2019s threat of crippling fines have been predominantly winning. The vast majority of lower courts have granted at least preliminary injunctive relief, protecting religious liberty. Although the ultimate outcome of these cases (as both sides have appealed their losses) appear hopeful for the plaintiffs, even good Supreme Court rulings will not solve the entire problem.\n\nA non-religious organization (for example, Americans United for Life) may have a moral objection, but not a religious objection and a claim under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). To that end, conscience protecting legislation has also been introduced in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate. Importantly, the Health Care Rights of Conscience Act (H.R. 940 and S. 1204) protects the conscience rights of religious and moral objectors.\n\nA loss in the Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood cases would certainly be a significant setback for conscience rights.\n\nThe denial of injunctive relief for the Green and Hahn families will force real people into an immediate untenable position of either facing fines that may cripple their businesses or violating their religious beliefs.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s lawyer conceded during oral arguments that under its theory of the case other anti-life mandates\u2014like the abortion insurance mandate passed by the Washington State House\u2014would be enforceable against religious objections.\n\nFortunately, history tells us that when the U.S. Supreme Court gets it wrong, the battle is not over. RFRA itself was a Congressional response to a court decision denying a religious liberty claim.\n\nWin, lose, or draw, Congress can add clarity and security to our cherished First Amendment freedoms by passing the Health Care Rights of Conscience Act.\n\nAnna Franzonello is Staff Counsel at Americans United for Life and twice testified before the Institute of Medicine panel and authored comments
