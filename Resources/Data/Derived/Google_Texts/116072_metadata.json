Reconsider 'Texas solution' for Medicaid 1 / 2 Back to Gallery\n\nIf candidates for governor and the Legislature can put aside party politics long enough to discern the economic benefits of expanding Medicaid, there may be renewed hope for covering approximately 2 million uninsured low-income Texans left out of the new health care law.\n\nNew studies on the results of the first enrollment period of the Affordable Care Act show that the 26 states expanding Medicaid have not only increased insurance coverage but reaped economic rewards from the greater federal funds that have spurred growth in the health sectors of these states.\n\nIn August, the Urban Institute released a review of state-level fiscal studies in 16 states. In each analysis, expansion of Medicaid was found to help state budgets. Without exception, state savings and new state revenue were found to exceed state Medicaid expansion costs. The Urban Institute estimated the 10-year state price tag to expand Medicaid in Texas from 2013 to 2022 would be $5.7 billion, but the state would get $65.6 billion in federal matching funds over that period.\n\nOf all the states, Texas would seem to be the most likely candidate for expanding Medicaid. Texas has the highest percent of uninsured residents. One in 4 Texans \u2014 6.4 million \u2014 are uninsured.\n\nOnly extremely poor families with children qualify for Medicaid in Texas. To qualify under the current plan, an adult must be a parent with an annual family income of less than 19 percent of the federal poverty level: $3,700 for a family of three. Only one other state, Alabama, has a lower income eligibility limit. Nondisabled adults who have no children are not eligible at all.\n\nExpanding Medicaid eligibility to nearly all low-income adults \u2014 those with incomes below 138 percent of the poverty level, or $27,300 for a family of three \u2014 was one of the core components of the coverage provisions of the ACA as passed in 2010. The federal government would cover total cost of Medicaid expansion for the first three years and at least 90 percent of the cost thereafter.\n\nThen in June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Medicaid expansion is optional for states, and Texas was one of 24 (mostly Southern) states that elected not to expand Medicaid. In all states, people with incomes above 100 percent of poverty \u2014 depending on their salary and number of people in their household \u2014 can receive premium tax credits, or subsidies, to purchase coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplaces. But people below poverty are not eligible for marketplace subsidies, thus creating an eligibility gap for poor people in states that do not expand Medicaid.\n\nIt's estimated that more than 1 million working-age Texans living below poverty lack an affordable coverage option, according to Anne Dunkelberg of the Center for Public Policy Priorities. And almost 8 in 10 of them are people of color.\n\nAs much as $6 billion in federal funds are lost each year that Texas does not take advantage of the offer to expand Medicaid. Even worse, lack of access to health coverage among low-income Texans results in poor health due to delay of care and continued use of emergency rooms for routine care, increasing costs to everyone in the health care system.\n\nA \u201cTexas solution\u201d to the coverage gap might allow the state to accept federal funds within a state-customized private alternative to expanding Medicaid. Such a plan was offered by legislators on both sides of the aisle in 2013, but it did not receive support from Gov. Rick Perry.\n\nRealizing the economic and health care costs of the governor's rejection of the federal offer to expand, county judges from the six largest Texas counties have called for a \u201cuniquely Texas solution\u201d to the medical needs of the poor in a letter to the chair of the Senate Health and Human Services Commission.\n\nTexas will have a new governor and some new legislators in 2015. The question that voters should be asking the candidates in November is whether they can remove their ideological blinders to allow negotiation with the feds for a creative solution to the problem of health care coverage for the disadvantaged.\n\nRobert Brischetto is former executive director of the Southwest Voter Research Institute.", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "If candidates for governor and the Legislature can put aside party politics long enough to discern the economic benefits of expanding Medicaid, there may be renewed hope for covering approximately 2 million uninsured low-income Texans left out of the new health care law.
