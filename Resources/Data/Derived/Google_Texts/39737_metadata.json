Half the group had spent their careers in the public sector, while the other half came from the private sector.\n\nRelated: Our 401(k) Totals Just Reached a New Record. Don\u2019t Celebrate Yet\u2026 \u200b\n\nNearly all these boomers, or 94 percent, said it was important for them to feel financially confident before they decided to retire. However, when asked what exactly prompted their step into retirement, financial readiness dropped a few notches down the list.\n\nHere are the reasons most chosen by recent retirees as a trigger for retirement, according to the online study that was conducted in the fall:\n\nIt\u2019s time to enjoy life (35 percent)\n\nDon\u2019t want to work anymore (16 percent)\n\nForced out by employer or given early retirement incentive (16 percent)\n\nReached my retirement savings goal (12 percent)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe breakdown indicates that the decision to retire is as much an emotional one as it is financial.\n\n\u201cThe financial and emotional preparations for retirement need to come together for a successful retirement, but the actual decision itself isn\u2019t necessarily as balanced,\u201d said Marcy Keckler, v.p. of financial advice strategy at Ameriprise Financial in Minneapolis. \u201cA lot of people just want to enjoy themselves.\u201d\n\nAs further evidence of the role emotions play in the decision to retire and the aftermath of that decision, there\u2019s another surprising finding: While these baby boomers, who all retired within the last five years, may have felt financially confident when they retired, some are already having second thoughts.\n\nRelated: Boomer Alert: What You Must Know Before You Retire\n\nAbout a third, or 29 percent, say they would have saved more money beforehand, while 22 percent say they\u2019re spending more money in retirement that they thought they would. The fact that an overwhelming majority of these boomer retirees still have a pension \u2013 70 percent in this survey \u2013 may also be a key reason they weren\u2019t as worried about having enough savings to retire.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have to tap into retirement savings,\u201d Keckler noted. \u201cWe definitely expect that share to decline [in future surveys], since we know it\u2019s increasingly less common for employers to offer pensions.\u201d\n\nAs traditional pensions slowly disappear or become increasingly underfunded, the list of reasons for retiring and the breakdown within them will certainly change in the years to come. \u201cIt will be interesting to watch,\u201d said Keckler.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "For recent retirees, financial readiness was far from the most important factor in the", "title": "The Surprising Reasons Baby Boomers Retire", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/03/Surprising-Reasons-Baby-Boomers-Retire", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05132011_couple_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/03/Surprising-Reasons-Baby-Boomers-Retire", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05132011_couple_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "For recent retirees, financial readiness was far from the most important factor in the", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc615\"", "article_summary": "Ameriprise Financial surveyed 1,000 newly retired baby boomers between the ages of 60 and 73 years old with at least $100,000 in investable assets.\nHowever, when asked what exactly prompted their step into retirement, financial readiness dropped a few notches down the list.\nFor recent retirees, financial readiness was far from the most important factor in their decision to step off the hamster wheel.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have to tap into retirement savings,\u201d Keckler noted.\nDon\u2019t Celebrate Yet\u2026 \u200bNearly all these boomers, or 94 percent, said it was important for them to feel financially confident before they decided to retire."}
