Brookings, SD

It's the most widespread blizzard in the upper Midwest this winter and the most recent in a wave of heavy storms hitting KELOLAND in the past few weeks.

With strong wind gusts, drifting and blowing snow, and icy conditions I-29 is closed from Sioux Falls all the way to the Canadian Border.

Inside Brookings' city limits, conditions weren't much better as wind was whipping snow around the main roads and the residential areas. Elaine Grings thought the weather was going to cooperate with her today as she went out to shovel, but Mother Nature had other ideas.

"The sun was shining less than an hour ago, so I came out to start shoveling. It's changed again," Brookings resident Elaine Grings said.

Grings says she had no plans to go out and drive today, but when she does she makes sure to always have a winter survival pack.
