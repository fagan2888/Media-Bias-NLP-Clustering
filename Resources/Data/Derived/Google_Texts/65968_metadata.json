Meanwhile, in Iraq, al-Qaida-backed militants play a more dangerous game, occupying cities and sending the country back into violence. Data Mine has the scoop for you on all fronts.\n\n\n\nBrazil spent $11.3 billion on World Cup: Brazil\u2019s side is favored to win the World Cup title, but its poverty stricken citizens don\u2019t feel like winners. The South American nation loves the beautiful game but activists are protesting the costs of hosting Mundial, including the deaths of eight workers who helped build the stadium in Rio de Janeiro. The World Cup website details the times and scores for matches.\n\n\n\n7,200 votes: That\u2019s how many votes Cantor lost by in the Republican primary of Virginia\u2019s 7 th Congressional district on Tuesday.

Only 47 percent view Obama favorably, the least positive personal assessment of the president ever. Factors playing into this rating could be the recent scandal concerning medical care for veterans and the controversial release of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. In the past, there were only three other times when his unfavorable rating exceeded his favorable rating: once in October 2010 just before midterm elections, and twice in late 2013 during the tumultuous rollout of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\nCourtesy of Gallup\n\nDon\u2019t forget Dad this Sunday!
