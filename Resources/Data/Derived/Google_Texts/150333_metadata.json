But now, as Massachusetts merges with Obamacare, he\u2019s among the roughly 150,000 members who have to enroll all over again, under somewhat different federal rules.\n\nSo early last month, the 57-year-old artist sat down at his computer in Hyde Park, and logged on to a new Health Connector website.\n\n\u201cThe first time [the website] didn\u2019t work at all,\u201d he said. \u201cThe second time I got in but then it went black. The third time I tried logging on\u2026 they were doing some kind of maintenance.\u201d\n\nAt one point, Freedner couldn\u2019t get past a particular verification page.\n\n\u201cThey said I was incarcerated,\u201d he said, shrugging. He\u2019s never been in jail.\n\nFreedner, who used to design websites, kept trying to complete his application. He had to reset his password several times and may have several applications pending \u2014 he\u2019s not sure. He got to the end of one application exactly one month ago.\n\n\u201cIt seems like it\u2019s finished, but it\u2019s been a month, right?\u201d Freedner said, raising his eyebrows. \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t heard anything. No confirmation, nothing.\u201d\n\nFrustrated Massachusetts residents who think they\u2019ll qualify for subsidized health insurance or hope to continue a subsidized plan are posting similar stories to the Connector\u2019s Facebook page. The Connector staff is posting occasional apologies and on Thursday laid out the problems for the agency\u2019s board.\n\n\u201cThings aren\u2019t perfect,\u201d said Scott Devonshire, the Connector\u2019s chief information officer. \u201cObviously we\u2019re having some issues on the site right now.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the glitches like those Freedner mentioned, the state has not been able to process any applications yet, because the federal interface that\u2019s supposed to verify an applicant\u2019s income and some other factors isn\u2019t working.\n\n\u201cNobody is more frustrated by that than us,\u201d Devonshire said. \u201cWe want everyone who comes to the site to have a first-rate experience. So we are literally working around the clock to try to resolve some of these issues.\u201d\n\nThe Connector\u2019s $69 million site was built by the same company \u2014 CGI \u2014 that built the federal website. Connector leaders say the sites are not linked and it doesn\u2019t look like the root problems are the same.\n\nConnector board Chair Glen Shor say he\u2019s focused on fixing the issues in Massachusetts.\n\n\u201cOf course we\u2019re frustrated,\u201d Shor said. \u201cWe take this extraordinarily seriously. We\u2019re proud of what we accomplished and we know how much health insurance means to people. So we want the system to go seamlessly and perfectly and we\u2019re working \u2019round the clock to make that possible.\u201d\n\nThe Connector\u2019s call center, where people go for answers to problems with the website, is also on overload. The Connector will almost double the center\u2019s staff for the time being.\n\nThe 150,000 or so people caught in this hold-up are supposed to choose a new health plan by the end of December or risk losing their coverage. But the Connector said Thursday that it will extend current coverage through the end of March, in keeping with the open enrollment period for the rest of the country.\n\nThere is some embarrassment in Massachusetts that the state\u2019s model health care program is succumbing to problems the federal government and many states that are new to this business are having. Brian Rosman, research director at Health Care for All, says Massachusetts tried to add more layers than most states when it designed a new website to comply with Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s turning out to be trickier than [the Connector] realized,\u201d Rosman said.\n\nEven so, says Rosman, outreach teams organized by his group aren\u2019t hearing a lot of concern from residents they remind to re-enroll.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not hearing panic or we\u2019re hearing modest frustration, sometimes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we hear other people who are getting through right away and filling out their forms and pretty happy with it.\u201d\n\nSo maybe this will be a short-term adjustment as Massachusetts merges with the federal requirements of Obamacare. The Connector aims to clear up problems with its website later this month or in early December.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some of the problems plaguing HealthCare.gov appear to be popping up in Massachusetts too.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "Some of the problems plaguing HealthCare.gov appear to be popping up in Massachusetts too.", "title": "Web Glitches Snarl Health Insurance Enrollment In Mass.", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2013/11/website-problems-health-connector", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2013/11/1114_freedner-620x474.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2013/11/website-problems-health-connector", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2013/11/1114_freedner-620x474.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Web Glitches Snarl Health Insurance Enrollment In Mass."}, "DC.date.issued": "2013-11-14", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "date": "Thu, 14 Nov 2013 17:37:18 -0500"}, "article_summary": "Web Glitches Snarl Health Insurance Enrollment In Mass.\nBOSTON \u2014 Some of the problems plaguing the new federal health insurance website appear to be popping up in Massachusetts.\nWe\u2019re proud of what we accomplished and we know how much health insurance means to people.\nSo early last month, the 57-year-old artist sat down at his computer in Hyde Park, and logged on to a new Health Connector website.\nNo confirmation, nothing.\u201dFrustrated Massachusetts residents who think they\u2019ll qualify for subsidized health insurance or hope to continue a subsidized plan are posting similar stories to the Connector\u2019s Facebook page."}
