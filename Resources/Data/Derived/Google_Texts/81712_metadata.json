For the first time since 2010 (and truthfully since 2009) the so-called entitlements do not seem to be on the chopping block.\n\nIt\u2019s worth revisiting how cuts to America\u2019s most important safety net came to be on a Democratic president\u2019s agenda in a time of economic crisis and financial chaos. Talking about cutting such programs at a time like that has been the last thing on any liberal\u2019s mind since Franklin Roosevelt took John Maynard Keynes\u2019 advice and used federal money to try to put people to work and stimulate the economy. Most observers assumed that Hoover\u2019s advisor Andrew Mellon\u2019s, prescription to \u201cliquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate farmers, liquidate real estate\u2026 People will work harder, live a more moral life\u2026\u201d was an old saw that had turned into a punchline. But as we saw, Jazz-age austerity was suddenly back in vogue and everyone believed the crisis was a good opportunity to \u201cdo big things\u201d which were all sold as being big government money savers. This was the Grand Bargain which President Obama first sprang on the nation a couple of weeks before he was inaugurated.\n\nYou\u2019ll recall that the Grand Bargain consisted of three big reforms. The first was health care reform (to \u201cbend the cost curve.\u201d) The second was \u201centitlement\u201d reform (to \u201cmake the program financially sound\u201d) and finally there was tax reform which would be revenue neutral lest anyone open that tax hike can of worms. The beltway was giddy with excitement about all this in the early days of the administration signaling as it did that the president was ready to embrace both their beloved bipartisanship and obsessive deficit fetish. The media called it \u201caudacious\u201d not because they thought .it would be difficult to achieve but because it was so very Grand. The common thinking was that if the new president could get these pesky problems off the country\u2019s plate once and for all, then he would be free to \u2026 well, do other things, presumably having to do with miracles and world peace.\n\nEveryone knows what happened next. Health reform was a painful and difficult process that ended up passing on a party line vote through an unusual procedural route due to the fact that the Democrats lost their 60th vote when Senator Kennedy passed away. But the first leg of the Grand Bargain passed. And by the time it did the right wing of the Republican Party had completely lost its collective mind.\n\nNonetheless, the White House believed it might be able to rekindle some of that old bipartisan feeling if it put deficit reduction on the top of the agenda and feature some serious cuts to Social Security to get those Republicans to agree to raise taxes on the wealthy. They tried more than once to get that done but despite over half a century of demagogueing Social Security, when the Democrats offered to cut it, they couldn\u2019t take yes for an answer.That would have meant giving President Obama a \u2018win\u201d and they just couldn\u2019t stomach it. And anyway, by that time the obstruction strategy was in full effect and they were joyfully rampaging through the capitol attempting to destroy the country\u2019s credit ratings, shutting down the government, cutting off Unemployment Insurance and all manner of other random destruction across the domestic political landscape. In a mad scramble to keep the United States government from completely imploding they cobbled together the travesty of sequestration that cut deeply into necessary programs for real people. But the second piece of the Grand Bargain \u2014 \u201centitlement reform\u201d \u2014 was left on the cutting room floor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just when you thought a Grand Bargain was dead, Ryan's back with a tax scheme.
