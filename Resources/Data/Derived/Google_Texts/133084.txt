Police arrested 23-year-old James Toles for the charges of cultivating a controlled dangerous substance, possession with intent to distribute and possession of a weapon while committing a felony.

A disturbing the peace call led Oklahoma City police to a marijuana growing operation at a home on the northwest side of the metro, Saturday.

Police arrested 23-year-old James Toles for the charges of cultivating a controlled dangerous substance, possession with intent to distribute and possession of a weapon while committing a felony.

Officers were first dispatched to the home, located in the 1000 block of NW 86th St., in reference to a woman making threats with a knife just before 11 a.m. Saturday.

Officers first made contact with Toles and told him they were concerned about a woman inside the home. As they approached the front door the officers said they could smell marijuana emitting from the home.

Once inside police located the woman. They then found some small marijuana plants growing inside the kitchen. It was at this time the officers called in a narcotics unit.

The narcotics officers obtained a search warrant for the residence and began searching the home. Inside they found 3 pounds of marijuana in a locked safe along with a loaded pistol. They also found several glass containers with marijuana throughout the house. Investigators then located items used to grow and cultivate marijuana indoors.

Several weapons were found inside the home as well, including a shotgun, two assault rifles and ammunition.

Police determined both the woman and Toles were residents at the home and that both had knowledge of the guns and the marijuana.

Toles was also found to have multiple prior felony convictions out of Oklahoma County for second-degree burglary and concealing stolen property. He was taken into custody at the scene and booked into the Oklahoma County Jail. The woman has not yet been identified.
