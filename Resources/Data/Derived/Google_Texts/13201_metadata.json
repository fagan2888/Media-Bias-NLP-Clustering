The remaining states have left it to the nationwide federal exchange, HealthCare.gov, to sign up Americans for the program. Bevin contends that Kynect is redundant and unnecessary, and had signaled plans to end the program.\n\nBevin notified the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in a Dec. 30 letter that the dismantling and transition would be undertaken \u201cas soon as is practicable.\u201d That prompted a Jan. 28 response from an HHS official stating that \u201cceasing Kynect will create a number of challenges that must be addressed to ensure that access to affordable health coverage continues for Kentucky\u2019s consumers,\u201d according to Insider Louisville.\n\nRelated: 7 Obamacare Predictions That Haven\u2019t Come True\n\nAndrew Slavitt, the acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, raised a number of red flags in his response to Bevin and outlined \u201ca set of activities that Kentucky will need to immediately take to ensure a smooth transition for its consumers.\u201d These include:\n\nProducing a detailed plan for how the state will continue to meet its obligations to enrollees and future enrollees through 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\nArranging for discussions between insurers participating in Kynect and the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \u201cto ensure that those companies understand the transition activities.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nPaying a 3 percent fee on insurance costs required of states that steer their residents to the federal exchange to purchase subsidized and market-rate health insurance policies.\n\n\n\n\n\nForgoing nearly $58 million of the $289 million in federal grants that Kentucky received to help establish Kynect. None of those remaining funds can be used to cover the costs of the transition. And it\u2019s possible the federal government will attempt to reclaim the more than $200 million of grant money already spent.\n\n\n\n\n\nBevin has argued that dismantling Kynect would be relatively easy and not terribly costly to the state. But it looks like the new Republican governor\u2019s dream of ridding the state of responsibility for Obamacare could create budgetary and logistical difficulties for residents and state officials.\n\nRelated: GOP Fires a Warning Shot in Kentucky in the War Against Obamacare\n\nA consultant retained by the Beshear administration estimated that shuttering Kynect would cost $23 million, but that may prove to be an optimistic assumption given the loss of the federal grant.\n\nBeyond that, Kynect is unusual because it has successfully integrated its private insurance exchange with Medicaid and the Childrens\u2019 Health Insurance Program (CHIP). As a result, Slavitt warned in his letter to Bevin, the state will have to decouple these three programs and figure out how to continue to administer the Medicaid and CHIP programs while sending responsibility for the private insurance market back to the federal government.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Tea party Republican Matt Bevin had to tone down his anti-Obamacare rhetoric in order", "title": "New Governor Moves Quickly to Dismantle Obamacare in Kentucky", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/10/New-Governor-Moves-Quickly-Dismantle-Obamacare-Kentucky", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02102016_Matt_Bevin.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/10/New-Governor-Moves-Quickly-Dismantle-Obamacare-Kentucky", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02102016_Matt_Bevin.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Tea party Republican Matt Bevin had to tone down his anti-Obamacare rhetoric in order", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Beyond that, Kynect is unusual because it has successfully integrated its private insurance exchange with Medicaid and the Childrens\u2019 Health Insurance Program (CHIP).\nThe new governor has argued that preserving Kynect would be a \u201cwasteful redundancy\u201d because state residents can also obtain insurance through the federal exchange.\nThe remaining states have left it to the nationwide federal exchange, HealthCare.gov, to sign up Americans for the program.\nForgoing nearly $58 million of the $289 million in federal grants that Kentucky received to help establish Kynect.\nTea party Republican Matt Bevin had to tone down his anti-Obamacare rhetoric in order to win election as governor of Kentucky last November."}
