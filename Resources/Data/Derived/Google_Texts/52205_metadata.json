So I got to see mistakes people made, mistakes I didn\u2019t want to make again once I got out, and I laid the preparation so that I will be successful in my life.\u201d\n\nLindsay was one of 46 federal inmates granted clemency by President Barack Obama in July.\n\nIn receiving a commutation, a form of clemency that keeps the conviction but ends the sentence, Lindsay was spared what was supposed to be a life in prison for a nonviolent, first-time drug offense.\n\nNow that he\u2019s free, Lindsay does not want to just bear witness.\n\nInstead, if he follows the path he planned for so long, Lindsay will incorporate his own ministry far from Newberry, maybe in Charlotte, N.C.\n\n\u201cI planned my dreams so many months and years out,\u201d Lindsay says on this first official day of freedom, Nov. 10, when a cloudy morning makes way for uncovered sun. \u201cI want to get to the point where I can have my day to me, and not have to be on someone else\u2019s job working hard\u2014letting my money make money so I can do what I want to do, which is my ministry.\u201d\n\nNo Excuses\n\nIt\u2019s not that Lindsay isn\u2019t appreciative of Newberry, and the stable, zero-tolerance upbringing provided by his divorced parents\u2014his mother, Betty, and late father, also named Douglas.\n\nIt\u2019s just hard to reconcile with the past when it\u2019s the place you did wrong, after living a childhood and early adulthood that had started so right.\n\nBefore Lindsay sold drugs\u2014first marijuana, then crack cocaine\u2014he served his first four years out of high school in the Army. According to a report this month by the U.S. Department of Justice, 181,500 veterans (8 percent of all inmates) were incarcerated in state and federal prison in 2011-12.\n\nLindsay is also a college graduate with a bachelor\u2019s degree in social work and was once employed in a job helping the mentally handicapped.\n\nBut selling drugs made financing his education easier, and everyone around him was doing it, Lindsay says.\n\n\u201cI never enjoyed selling drugs,\u201d Lindsay says. \u201cI saw it as a means to an end to hopefully get to the next level. I don\u2019t make excuses. It was wrong. But that\u2019s what I did.\u201d\n\nWhen he was arrested in May 1996 as part of a 14-person indictment, federal prosecutors alleged that Lindsay had done more than sell drugs.\n\nAccording to his pre-sentencing report, obtained by The Daily Signal, prosecutors said Lindsay operated a crack house in Newberry that belonged to his aunt.\n\nThe report also says Lindsay denied his involvement in a drug conspiracy.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t help the government because I didn\u2019t want to be a snitch and to incriminate myself even more,\u201d Lindsay says.\n\nLindsay now acknowledges that he used the house of his aunt, who was a drug user, as a place to keep and sell drugs, but he says calling it a crack house is too extreme. Prosecutors alleged Lindsay and other members of the group sold at least 1 kilogram of crack. He was convicted at trial.\n\nDespite these factors, criminal justice experts say the biggest reason Lindsay was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time offender is that he decided to go to trial.\n\nWhile all of the 13 other defendants pleaded guilty, cooperating with the government in exchange for reduced sentences, Lindsay, at the advice of a private lawyer hired by his mother, went to trial.\n\nAnd he lost.\n\nAt the time, prosecutors often used the threat of long prison sentences mandated by federal sentencing guidelines to extract more guilty pleas, according to Molly Gill, government affairs counsel at Families Against Mandatory Minimums.\n\n\u201cPeople who plead guilty get rewarded with shorter sentences for testifying against co-defendants, and I think some of the problems we see are that it creates incredible incentives to sometimes inflate drug quantities, to inflate the bad behavior of co-defendants,\u201d Gill tells The Daily Signal.\n\nGill continues: \u201cSo I think what we see here is the clear instance of the trial penalty in Douglas\u2019 case.\u201d\n\nLindsay would not have been sentenced so harshly today, Gill says.\n\nToday, the sentencing guidelines are advisory, meaning a judge can use his or her discretion in administering punishment.\n\nIn addition, in 2010, Congress changed the law to reduce the sentencing disparity between offenses involving crack and powder cocaine.\n\nYet all of this came too late for Lindsay. On Sept. 10, 1996, just before his girlfriend at the time pressed him to propose to her, Lindsay was sentenced to life in prison.\n\nHe was 28 years old.\n\n\u2018Never Accepted the Life Sentence\u2019\n\nIt might not seem like much, but for Lindsay, the gray speckles that invade the hair atop his head signify all he\u2019s lost.\n\n\u201cI hate \u2018Old School,\u2019\u201d Lindsay says of the nickname fellow inmates gave him. \u201cI hate the gray hair with a passion. I tell people all the time. I know you see my gray hair on my head now, but I had a very young-looking face when I went to prison.\u201d\n\nHe tries to hide the gray by dyeing it, but it\u2019s hard to get back certain things.\n\nHis father died in 2003, and his mother, Betty, survived ovarian cancer. During her many visits to see Lindsay, his mother hid the severity of her tumor for fear of worrying her son. In a way, it was payback for Lindsay\u2019s never telling his mother about his drug life.\n\n\u201cI lost a lot,\u201d Lindsay says. He adds:\n\nI went to prison at 28, so I lost all my 30s and 70 percent of my 40s. I always had the plan I would be married at 30, children after that, white house, picket fence like everyone else talks about. Whereas now, I don\u2019t even know if I want children. Hopefully one day I will meet the right woman to get married, but I don\u2019t know when. And then, with how long it takes, do I want to have a child at 50 years old? Life kind of passed me by.\n\nDuring Lindsay\u2019s time incarcerated, which spanned five prisons across four states, he did his best to take hold of what he could control.\n\n\u201cI never accepted the life sentence or allowed myself to accept it,\u201d Lindsay says. \u201cI refused to believe I was going to spend my life in prison as a first-time offender. It didn\u2019t make sense to me, and I refused to accept it.\u201d\n\nLindsay spent most of his time in the law library, reading up on ways to appeal his case. When appeals failed, he found the option of clemency, and applied first in 2003.\n\nHe was rejected, under President George W. Bush, before Obama granted him freedom.\n\nLindsay says he read every single Harry Potter book more than once, because it\u2019s hard to retain imagination in prison.\n\nIt\u2019s almost clich\u00e9d to say, but, facing his lowest point, Lindsay found religion. Except he lived it, handwriting biblical lessons to mail to his mother, who would give them to people struggling on the outside.\n\n\u201cMost guys in prison tell you they found some form of religion,\u201d Lindsay says, adding:\n\nI am no different. Before, I went to church. But I didn\u2019t give my life to Christ until I got in trouble, like most people. Being saved was the best thing that ever happened to me. I grew up cussing. In the Army, everyone cussed. As soon as I got saved, he took that from me.\n\nIt won\u2019t mean much to employers, but Lindsay earned prison certificates in subjects such as investments, financial analysis, and real estate. He even traded stock through TD Ameritrade, purchasing shares over the phone using the $200 per month he made working a prison job sewing pockets on military jackets.\n\n\u201cI lost every time,\u201d Lindsay says. \u201cI was too fast.\u201d\n\nAfter being granted clemency in July, Lindsay spent his last month in a halfway house in Columbia, S.C.\n\nThere, still under the custody of the Bureau of Prisons, Lindsay got a taste of freedom, leaving the facility during the day to work on a construction site. He reported back at night to sleep, on the bottom level of a bunk bed in a small room that could hold five other inmates.\n\nMany federal inmates on the way out of prison spend their last month or so in halfway houses, to ease the transition.\n\nIn early October, on the way from a minimum security prison in Jesup, Ga., to the Columbia halfway house, Lindsay, with his younger brother, Alcindor, enjoyed his first meal at Wendy\u2019s, scarfing down a Baconator combo.\n\nAlcindor, whom Lindsay calls \u201cAl,\u201d shopped with his brother for new clothes, buying him a couple of oversized polos. Though Lindsay felt old, he wanted to look fresh.\n\nOn Nov. 10 at 7:59 a.m, Lindsay checked out of the halfway house.\n\nAs he walked away with Alcindor, his back facing the past, Lindsay said softly, \u201cI\u2019m home. I\u2019m home.\u201d\n\nPast to Future\n\nFor prisoners who\u2019ve served lengthy sentences, the past is never too far behind; it\u2019s all they know.\n\nSo when Lindsay says he wants to remake his own life, it\u2019s more idealistic than reality at first.\n\nOn his first day on the outside, Lindsay had to report to a U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services office in Columbia, where he took a drug test and was told he can\u2019t travel outside South Carolina unless granted permission.\n\nLindsay can be tested for drugs at any time, any place during the five years of his probation. If he violates these terms, he can be sent back to prison.\n\nSo Charlotte\u2014his preferred destination to start anew\u2014won\u2019t be possible anytime soon. For now, Lindsay is living with his brother, Al, 43, in a middle-class Columbia neighborhood, some 45 miles from Newberry.\n\nAl is also an ex-felon who sold drugs\u2014marijuana, and then crack cocaine, like his brother. Al served seven years and nine months in state prison before being paroled in 2003. He has since recovered to rebuild his life, marrying, landing a good-paying job, and becoming a part-time minister.\n\nThough the brothers spent some of their childhoods in separate homes (Lindsay at his father\u2019s, Al at their mother\u2019s), the two are tight. Al, who is shorter, stockier, and more gregarious than his brother, faults himself for introducing Lindsay to drugs. Lindsay, whose calm, meditative demeanor (\u201clevel-headed,\u201d as Al describes it) overrides any bitterness he may have, refuses to blame anyone.\n\nHe says he slept well on the first night at his brother\u2019s place:\n\nI slept like a baby. There are no guys hollering and screaming at 2 a.m., listening to music. I don\u2019t have to worry about a count at 4 o\u2019clock or some CO [correctional officer] going through my clothes. It\u2019s hard to put it into words to be able to go and come as you please without anyone having to tell you what to do, when to do it, and how do it. So it\u2019s wonderful.\n\nThis week, Lindsay says he will interview for the same position at the same job Al works, as an overnight forklift driver for a pasta plant, a place known to give ex-offenders a second chance.\n\nOn Sundays, Lindsay will attend their childhood church, Mount Zionist Baptist, and watch Al preach.\n\nLindsay will not preach there. He\u2019s looking for his own church, his own way, but he\u2019s constrained by the conditions of parole and dependent on his brother to live.\n\nYet Lindsay knows that the stability Al offers gives him an advantage over most ex-offenders, and he\u2019s eager to embrace change in the small ways that he can.\n\n\u201cI am blessed enough that unlike a lot of guys who get out of prison and have to wonder where they\u2019re going to work and most end up in fast food restaurants, I got real jobs lined up, and there\u2019s no doubt I\u2019ll get them,\u201d Lindsay says.\n\nOn the same day he met with his probation officer for the first time, Lindsay passed his test for a driver\u2019s permit, and he hopes to buy a car. Lindsay succeeded only after taking practice tests on his phone and failing miserably.\n\n\u201cI used the free computer on my phone, went on the free website, studied practically all night,\u201d Lindsay says, mystified how a person today can use a phone\u2014or a computer, as he calls it\u2014for such a purpose. \u201cTechnology again came through for me.\u201d\n\nGray hair and all, Lindsay even talks of getting on a dating site, where he can always PhotoShop his picture.\n\nMarriage may come, after all, but that\u2019s a dream, and dreams will have to wait.\n\n\u201cThe stuff I learned, I want to use it out here, and then eventually in a couple years, maybe by the time I turn 50, I\u2019m going to be into counseling or maybe even public speaking,\u201d Lindsay says. \u201cAnd of course, I want to incorporate my ministry. But the first thing I am going to be doing for my family\u2014and really for me\u2014is I am not going back to prison.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "After being granted clemency by President Barack Obama, Douglas Lindsay faces the challenge of rebuilding his life after prison.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "After being granted clemency by President Barack Obama, Douglas Lindsay faces the challenge of rebuilding his life after prison.", "title": "After Obama Gives Clemency, a Federal Prisoner Rebuilds Life", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Clemency-ScreenGrab.png", "updated_time": "2015-12-21T15:59:29+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1m7xmfL"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "After being granted clemency by President Barack Obama, Douglas Lindsay faces the challenge of rebuilding his life after prison.", "title": "After Obama Gives Clemency, a Federal Prisoner Rebuilds Life", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Clemency-ScreenGrab.png"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Evergreen Topics", "tag": "overcriminalization", "published_time": "2015-12-07T17:40:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-21T15:59:29+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "clemency, Department of Justice, President Obama, Mandatory Minimum, FAMM, nonviolent drug crime, South Carolina, criminal justice reform, prison reform"}, "article_summary": "In a way, it was payback for Lindsay\u2019s never telling his mother about his drug life.\n\u201cI refused to believe I was going to spend my life in prison as a first-time offender.\nOn Sept. 10, 1996, just before his girlfriend at the time pressed him to propose to her, Lindsay was sentenced to life in prison.\nMany federal inmates on the way out of prison spend their last month or so in halfway houses, to ease the transition.\n\u201cI was too fast.\u201dAfter being granted clemency in July, Lindsay spent his last month in a halfway house in Columbia, S.C."}
