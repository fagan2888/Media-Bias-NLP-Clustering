But a new blow to the speaker\u2019s authority has come from another direction entirely.\n\nLate Wednesday, House leadership cancelled a vote on a bill that would have banned abortions after 20 weeks. The objections came not from hardline conservatives \u2013 but from some of the party\u2019s female members, who viewed its restrictions as excessive. Others worry the GOP cannot continue to take a hard line on social issues if it wants to broaden its national appeal.\n\nRelated: McConnell\u2019s Promise of Open Debate Puts GOP in Climate Bind\n\nAmong the major points of disagreement were the bill\u2019s few exceptions to the abortion restriction. A rape exception would only apply if the victim filed a formal report with the police. An incest exception would only apply to victims under 18 years of age.\n\nOn Thursday, House leadership saw enough support among the more moderate members of the conference bleed away that the bill \u2013 which would have attracted no Democratic votes \u2013 could not have achieved a simple majority in the House.\n\nThe decision to drop the bill was particularly embarrassing because the vote was scheduled for the same day as the annual March for Life in Washington staged by anti-abortion groups. The march marks the anniversary of the 1973 Supreme Court decision making abortions legal.\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\n\n\nIf the House of Representatives is always of one mind on any bill for purely political reasons, how could they be serving their constituents? Diversity of thought, punctuated by lively debates, is as important\u2014if not more important\u2014than ethnic diversity when it comes to vetting bills that may become law.\n\n\u201cWhat we saw this week was something that the Republican Party truly underestimated, and that\u2019s how small their majority is,\u201d said John Hudak, a Brookings Institution fellow in governance studies and the managing editor of Brookings\u2019 FixGov blog. \u201cBy historical standards, particularly Republican historical standards, it is large. But in terms of governing, running an institution, passing legislation, it\u2019s not. It doesn\u2019t take too many defections to kill a bill, particularly with a united Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nIn the past, Hudak noted, the Democratic caucus had its Blue Dogs, who would cross party lines on fiscal issues, and others who would do so on specific policy questions. More than once in recent years, Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi has helped Boehner get the votes he needs to push legislation through the House.\n\nRelated: Republicans Explore a New Tool for Blocking Obama\n\n\n\nNow, though, it\u2019s different. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a Democratic Party that is particularly interested in helping the speaker out when he needs a few votes,\u201d said Hudak.\n\nWhile the Republicans have their largest majority in the House of Representatives since the Hoover administration, that increase in numbers \u2013 not enough to guarantee Boehner majorities whenever he needs them \u2013 adds to his management challenges.\n\n\u201cAny time a majority caucus gets bigger there is more diversity and even free agency,\u201d said Donald R. Wolfensberger, director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington.\n\n\u201cBoehner is doing what [Dennis] Hastert did as speaker, and Newt [Gingrich] before him, and that is meet with members who have problems with certain bills or amendments, individually and sometimes in small groups, to talk things out (not to punish),\u201d said Wolfensberger, who served 28 years as a House staffer, rising to staff director of the Rules Committee. \u201cThe bigger the party, the more potential there is for problems arising that demand close and careful attention. Size is no guarantee of a safe margin for error or defections.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A rare challenge from House leadership\u2019s left flank on Wednesday night demonstrated that Speaker John Boehner has more than his Tea Party caucus to worry about when it comes to controlling the House of Representatives.", "title": "GOP Women to Boehner\u2014When It Comes to Abortion, Don\u2019t Mess with Us", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/22/GOP-Women-Boehner-When-It-Comes-Abortion-Don-t-Mess-Us", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2012-12-21T044855Z_1_CBRE8BK0DE000_RTROPTP_2_USA-FISCAL-BOEHNER.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/22/GOP-Women-Boehner-When-It-Comes-Abortion-Don-t-Mess-Us", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2012-12-21T044855Z_1_CBRE8BK0DE000_RTROPTP_2_USA-FISCAL-BOEHNER.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A rare challenge from House leadership\u2019s left flank on Wednesday night demonstrated that Speaker John Boehner has more than his Tea Party caucus to worry about when it comes to controlling the House of Representatives.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cYou don\u2019t have a Democratic Party that is particularly interested in helping the speaker out when he needs a few votes,\u201d said Hudak.\n\u201cBy historical standards, particularly Republican historical standards, it is large.\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) has been sandbagged by ultra-conservative members of the House Republican conference so often, he probably gets jumpy whenever he hears someone approaching from his right.\nOthers worry the GOP cannot continue to take a hard line on social issues if it wants to broaden its national appeal.\nRelated: McConnell\u2019s Promise of Open Debate Puts GOP in Climate BindAmong the major points of disagreement were the bill\u2019s few exceptions to the abortion restriction."}
