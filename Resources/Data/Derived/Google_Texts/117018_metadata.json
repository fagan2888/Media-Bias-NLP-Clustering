It was the polar opposite of the forgettable, simplistic, overanimated sci-fi tentpoles that Hollywood churned out year after year.\n\nIn contrast, what stands out most about Mr. Blomkamp\u2019s latest film, \u201cChappie,\u201d is how familiar it all feels.\n\nThe story, about a police robot that gains consciousness and begins to learn like a child while being parented by a pair of criminals, is cobbled together out of spare parts left over from \u201cRobocop,\u201d \u201cShort Circuit\u201d and even \u201cDistrict 9.\u201d\n\nAs in \u201cRobocop,\u201d the movie follows a private security corporation\u2019s efforts to replace human policing with robot crime-stoppers. The third act of \u201cChappie\u201d even features a giant tanklike mech that looks suspiciously like the militarized robot nemesis from the finale of \u201cRobocop.\u201d\n\nMuch like \u201cShort Circuit,\u201d the movie charts the moral development of a defense robot \u2014 the titular Chappie \u2014 that uniquely gains independent consciousness. The similarity is strong enough that I kept expecting Chappie to shout \u201cJohnny Five alive!\u201d\n\nJust as in \u201cDistrict 9,\u201d the movie is set in a quasi-bombed-out Johannesburg filled with heavily armed rival gangs. This time, though, the setting is less compelling. \u201cDistrict 9\u201d makes the city feel scrappy and alive with danger and chaos, but \u201cChappie\u201d makes it seem far less developed.\n\nMr. Blomkamp repeats his use of fake documentary clips to help ground the story but discards the device early on this time, as if he forgot about it partway through the editing process.\n\nTrue, the special effects remain impressive, especially given the film\u2019s modest budget, reportedly $50 million. (Most big special-effects movies cost at least twice as much.)\n\nMr. Blomkamp\u2019s effects are notable for their spectacle and their tactile quality. They have a physical presence, a weighty heft and grubby texture that often seems missing in an era of slick computer-generated effects that dominate the screen. Still, the effects show us little we haven\u2019t seen before.\n\nThe sense of \u201cbeen there, done that\u201d is not bad so much as it is disappointing. Mr. Blomkamp\u2019s vision was startling when it first arrived, but he now seems to have settled into a well-worn groove, content to rehash and recycle ideas about outcasts and outsiders while punctuating them with gory sci-fi shootouts.\n\nThe movie\u2019s best moments come near the end, after all the explosions stop, when the story shifts focus away from social oppression and toward the nature of consciousness itself.\n\nThe film builds toward the sort of heady conclusion more typically found in science fiction short stories than in mainstream action movies. The finale could have been better developed earlier in the film. Indeed, the film\u2019s resolution feels like the starting point for a better movie than the one that preceded it.\n\nNevertheless, the movie\u2019s clever finish is a good sign for a once-promising filmmaker who now seems stuck in a rut. It suggests that Mr. Blomkamp, who co-wrote the script with Terri Tatchell, may still have a few truly interesting ideas left.\n\nTITLE: \u201cChappie\u201d\n\nCREDITS: Directed by Neill Blomkamp; screenplay by Mr. Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell\n\nRATING: R for language, violence\n\nRUNNING TIME: 120 minutes", "article_metadata": {"description": "What stands out most about Neill Blomkamp's latest film, \"Chappie,\" is how familiar it all feels.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "What stands out most about Neill Blomkamp\u2019s latest film, \u201cChappie,\u201d is how familiar it all feels.", "title": "MOVIE REVIEW: \u2018Chappie\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/5/movie-review-chappie/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/05/3_5_2015_film-review-chappie-28201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/05/3_5_2015_film-review-chappie-28201.jpg", "description": "What stands out most about Neill Blomkamp's latest film, \"Chappie,\" is how familiar it all feels.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "MOVIE REVIEW: \u2018Chappie\u2019"}, "Author": "Peter Suderman", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, Neill Blomkamp"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3461\"", "article_summary": "In contrast, what stands out most about Mr. Blomkamp\u2019s latest film, \u201cChappie,\u201d is how familiar it all feels.\nTITLE: \u201cChappie\u201dCREDITS: Directed by Neill Blomkamp; screenplay by Mr. Blomkamp and Terri TatchellRATING: R for language, violenceRUNNING TIME: 120 minutes\nIt suggests that Mr. Blomkamp, who co-wrote the script with Terri Tatchell, may still have a few truly interesting ideas left.\nMr. Blomkamp\u2019s effects are notable for their spectacle and their tactile quality.\nThe similarity is strong enough that I kept expecting Chappie to shout \u201cJohnny Five alive!\u201dJust as in \u201cDistrict 9,\u201d the movie is set in a quasi-bombed-out Johannesburg filled with heavily armed rival gangs."}
