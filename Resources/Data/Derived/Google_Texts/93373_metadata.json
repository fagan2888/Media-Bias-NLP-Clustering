No matter how a person claims gender identity, there will be behavior that is irrepressibly consistent with the gender of birth. That has been established scientifically.\n\nAnyone so horrified by the law should have a daughter go into a bathroom with a birth male who claims to identify as a female. It should be interesting.\n\nRoderick Beaman, Orange Park\n\nPENSION TAX\n\nVoters want more details\n\nThe Times-Union published a piece concerning the status of the pension tax.\n\nIt included a quote from City Council President Greg Anderson, \u201cIf the Curry plan passes in August, additional legislation will be introduced in which details will be provided.\u201d\n\nIt appears he took a page right out on the Nancy Pelosi playbook, \u201cWe need to pass Obamacare legislation in order to see what is in it.\u201d\n\nWe all know how that worked out\n\nAnderson may have been just stating a fact and not expressing support for that chain of events.\n\nHowever, if he or the mayor believes that this tax will pass with a \u201cTrust Me\u201d label, they have not been paying attention to the people.\n\nTrusting politicians is how we ended up in this hole.\n\nRandall Groger, Jacksonville\n\nOBAMA\u2019S RECORD\n\nPoor in many respects\n\nWhere has a letter writer supporting President Barack Obama been for the past seven years?\n\nThe Constitution and Congress have been ignored by this administration.\n\nObamacare was passed without any Republican input or votes.\n\nObama has issued unlawful executive orders to make up his own rules.\n\nWe need a president who will protect the Constitution, not work around it.\n\nWe need a Supreme Court that will follow the law and not let politics dictate the direction of their votes.\n\nThomas Vaughters, Fleming Island\n\nOUR CITY\u2019S NAME\n\nLet\u2019s go with Jax\n\nMaybe it is time to rebrand the name Jacksonville.\n\nAlthough we are the biggest city with that name, there are too many Jacksonvilles around the country.\n\nOur founding namesake \u201cJackson\u201d has a negative connotation these days and fairly or not is a politically incorrect figure. Consider the removal from $20 bill and the Trail of Tears.\n\nAlso \u201cville\u201d denotes small, and we are a big city. Competitors Miami, Tampa and Orlando have more memorable names.\n\nWhy not just shorten the name to \u201cJax\u201d or something else?\n\nJax is trendy like shortened LA, DC, NOLA and matches JaxPort and the JAX airport acronym.\n\nJax is already being used in casual emails. We could keep our name \u201cequity\u201d for the most part while shedding the negative.\n\nAlthough probably the least of our problems, it is something we may have to address for marketing reasons someday.\n\nBill Spinner, Jacksonville\n\nMAGNET SCHOOLS\n\nBest way to diversity\n\nJacksonville experienced the futility and foolishness of mandatory busing for the purpose of achieving a predetermined and supposedly ideal racial balance in all public schools.\n\nBy the 1980s, most parents of all races had their fill of that abuse of governmental power, and the community was able to win court approval of a much more sensible and humane approach: namely, using magnet schools to pursue diversity through shared interests instead of arbitrary racial quotas.\n\nNow, the informative Times-Union news story indicates that voluntarism currently is not achieving a contrived \u201cdiversity\u201d idea \u2014 at least 20 percent black students \u2014 in four of the 10 most-popular magnets.\n\nBut how big a deal is that really if children have the opportunity to go the school of their choice \u2014 whether regular neighborhood, charter, private on a tax-credit scholarship or magnet?\n\nIf some black parents are shunning magnets because they wrongly assume they would have to pay tuition, then that is a communications problem the school system should address.\n\nOtherwise, choice serves the interests of students a lot better than government treating students as though the only trait that matters is the color of their skins.\n\nRobert Holland, The Heartland Institute,\n\nChicago", "article_metadata": {"description": "CHARACTER RECIPEFor our childrenBegin with victimhood; it is the stock or this stew.Mix in entitlement for flavor.Chop the onions of injustice; be careful these can bring tears to your eyes.Finally, add rage for spice.Let these stew together until they are about to boil over.
