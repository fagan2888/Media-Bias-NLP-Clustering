But from these compensatory platitudes came conversations, and conversation led to my finding out that our security guard is also an artist with a fascinating relationship to New York jazz clubs and some of the genre\u2019s most iconic musicians. (He\u2019s been written about in the New York Times due to this very relationship.)\n\nHe eventually invited me to the opening of a show that features his art. The exhibition is at the Fountain House Gallery, which describes itself as \u201cthe premier venue in New York City representing artists with mental illness.\u201d Because of the obvious stigmas, it requires a certain openness to invite a relative stranger to a show mounted beneath that label; the label makes it both an invitation and a declaration.\n\nThe gallery is a nonprofit owned by the community-oriented organization, Fountain House, which helps rehabilitate and integrate people with mental illnesses into the workforce. If a Fountain House member is unable to work a shift because of their condition, the organization sends one of their own staffers to fill in. The clubhouse, which is home to the gallery, is run in part by Fountain House\u2019s members \u2014 none of whom have to pay to participate.\n\nLike the 60 artists whose work the gallery consistently exhibits, the organization faces the paradoxes of carving out a space for marginalized creators, while aiming to focus on their work itself, not just the stories about why the work is on display there. The artists often contend with the contradictions of being deemed \u201coutsider\u201d artists based on mental illness \u2014 and the need to brand oneself within the capitalist carnival of the New York art scene \u2014 while also trying to stabilize their lives.\n\nAttending the exhibit raised some persistent personal questions for me. When I went on SSRIs, one of the biggest fears I\u2019d had was that my ability to write in a style I considered \u201ccomfortably frantic\u201d would be compromised. The mythical conflation of mental illness and creativity made me fear that making emotionally impactful art and being emotionally impacted \u2014 to the point of dysfunction \u2014 were inextricable.\n\nThrough the Fountain House Gallery and its artists, I went looking for answers about how artists with mental illness manage to function beyond the seductive but harmful mythos of heightened pain as the path to heightened art.\n\n***\n\nMartin Cohen is a prolific artist who has been involved with the Fountain House Gallery since the mid-\u201990s, helping expand it from a blank space for an \u201cArtist of the Month\u201d on a wall in the clubhouse into an entire gallery. He had a breakdown while he was an undergrad at SUNY Purchase, and was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder as a result. As it\u2019s described in a profile from 2007 in Schizophrenic Digest, he hallucinated his rock-star idols \u2014 whom he now often paints \u2014 \u201cflying out of the sky, led by Peter Gabriel as the Antichrist.\u201d Though he was hospitalized, he returned to school, and ultimately went on to get his MFA at Carnegie Mellon, where he studied with acclaimed abstract expressionist Sam Gilliam.\n\nCohen does link much of his work directly to the suffering implicit in his condition. He has explained that he\u2019s \u201ca mood-oriented artist\u201d and that his \u201cillness has informed [his] work and made [him] more willing to experiment.\u201d His series of \u201csatirical photomontages,\u201d as Artspace dubbed them, sees the heads of celebrities, politicians, and porn stars superimposed on heaven/hellscape backgrounds by Renaissance painters, in particular Hieronymus Bosch; he tells me these came from a cynical state following a breakdown. But the desire isn\u2019t for his art to keep him mired in those states \u2014 rather, he says the art itself is \u201ctherapeutic.\u201d His adult life has been marked by enduring, varyingly successful attempts at stability through a \u201cbumpy road\u201d of shifts in medical treatment.\n\nFlavorwire\u2019s building\u2019s security guard, Jonathan Glass, became an admirer \u2014 and a friend and mentee of sorts \u2014 of Cohen\u2019s when, after years of counseling at the Postgraduate Center for Mental Health, his then-girlfriend brought him to Fountain House. Cohen, Glass says, has helped him \u201caccept that being an artist is, itself, worthy of celebration.\u201d\n\nLike Cohen, Glass\u2019 mental health issues arose in college, where he suffered a series of schizophrenic episodes, which, as he told Clinical Psychiatry News, saw him purchasing a tuxedo and running onstage at a New York fashion show with a marriage proposal. His diagnosis was depression and schizoaffective disorder.\n\nWhen Glass went through a four-year phase of deep depression, he hardly drew whatsoever \u2014 with the exception of one sketchbook, which he would take with him to draw deliberately in the worst conditions New York had to offer: \u201cI would draw in 20-degree weather, I would draw in fierce winds, I would paint in the rain and everything would be washed out, but I would still paint.\u201d Perhaps due to the idolatry of the \u201csuffering artist,\u201d it was this sketchbook that sold for the highest amount he\u2019s earned for his art to date: $6,000. Glass says he doesn\u2019t question the motives of buyers, but rather tells himself to see any sale as a minor miracle. Here the weighty paradox emerges: his biggest sale came from a particularly difficult mental health period, but the work he sold was the only thing he\u2019d made in four years.\n\nGlass has moved past that phase, and he notes how even the lines of his portraits have become less lugubrious: \u201cMy illustration teacher said that you have to have life in order to give life, and that\u2019s true with art.\u201d Before coming to Fountain House, he participated in years of art therapy, whose aim is typically staunchly non-careerist; yet, based on his work, his art therapist encouraged it as a professional pursuit.\n\n\u201cIt might help to have something to grapple with,\u201d Glass says of the idea of psychological adversity inspiring art. \u201cIf you look at the history of art, in Greek sculpture you\u2019ll see there\u2019s a tension in those perfect bodies, between the motion and the stillness. They were going against the grain even though they were achieving perfection. And the Renaissance had to deal with the perfection of human nature in order to buoy themselves to do these incredibly realistic, high order art pieces. Sometimes Michelangelo would paint the Sistine Chapel three days and nights in a row. There\u2019s always something artists have to work against, if it\u2019s a rebellious thing or a creative impulse, that predisposes them to feel a certain way. But it doesn\u2019t mean that your whole life is a struggle, it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t make art when you\u2019re happy. If you look at Matisse\u2019s work, for example, it\u2019s very joyous.\u201d\n\nFor the last ten years, Glass has devoted his artistic time almost entirely to sketching jazz performers. His process is remarkable: he draws performers in the midst of concerts at jazz clubs (like New York\u2019s Zinc Bar, Birdland, and Jazz Gallery), where he\u2019s known to spread out across tables and sketch kinetically to the cues of the music.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t restrict himself to the more capacious tables at clubs, though: if he\u2019s going to a larger concert hall, he\u2019ll often buy two tickets to shows so that he can make way for his behemoth pads across two of the cramped seats. (He has friends he can bring who aren\u2019t too put off by having their laps used as easels.) Since childhood, Glass has been an avid collector of autographs, and his artwork is no exception. Frantically scrawled next to his fluid, expressionistic portraiture, you\u2019ll often see the signatures of the jazz musicians portrayed \u2014 small, incidental, interpretive self-portraits commingling with Jonathan\u2019s own interpretations of them. As such, the artists are aware of his presence at their shows. Some have become friends \u2014 Ravi Coltrane, for instance, who performed at one of Glass\u2019 openings.\n\nFor Glass, often the biggest challenge is making art in a country that provides a noteworthy support system for neither artists nor the mentally ill. In order to be self-sufficient enough to create, he has to work two jobs. His drawings \u2014 especially when he\u2019s depicting big band musicians \u2014 can take up to four sets to complete, and he often doesn\u2019t get out of a show until 1am, though he has to be up by 5am to work. (On weekends, he also works as a gallery attendant in Long Island City.) Beyond the costs of attending jazz clubs, he\u2019s needed to pay for his own medication for the last nine months: he describes how Obamacare\u2019s equivocating version of universal healthcare has seen him in a back-and-forth with the Medicaid offices for almost a year.\n\nBecause of Jonathan\u2019s unmistakably modernist style, he also feels disconnected from the contemporary art world\u2019s self-reflexively capitalist drive. Like many, he cites Jeff Koons as the locus of his disdain for contemporary art. It interests him as little, he says, as \u201cthe Rococo period \u2014 which was about showing rich people doing fun things and lavishing in their richness \u2014 and there was a huge underbelly of poor people who didn\u2019t get represented in art. I hate that, and we\u2019re seeing it again in a different form, in a way that pokes fun at just poking fun.\u201d\n\nHe may not have a considerable urge to participate in this aspect of the contemporary art sphere, but he\u2019s seen a surge of productivity over the last five years, following a seeming attempt on the part of the Fountain House Gallery to ease him out of relying on them for solo shows.\n\n\u201cA lot of the [Fountain House] artists are ambitious, but it\u2019s really hard for anybody to navigate the New York City art world and what it means,\u201d says Ariel Willmott, Fountain House Gallery\u2019s director, who emphasizes that the space is in many ways supposed to help artists transition beyond its confines. \u201cEspecially with individuals who are coming with a lack of connections. A lot of our artists are older and farther away from school. Being in the art world is all about connection. We foster connection through the gallery, but then the artists have to be able to go out there themselves. Many artists don\u2019t necessarily want to be pinned as an \u2018outsider\u2019 artist living with mental illness. But in a lot of ways that\u2019s the one door that\u2019s been opened to them.\u201d\n\nLike Glass, Cohen doesn\u2019t particularly fit the \u201coutsider artist\u201d description \u2014 he too is highly trained, and has seen some traditional success within the New York art scene, with various solo shows and a smattering of corporate buyers. But \u201crepresenting himself has not always been easy for [Cohen],\u201d Jonathan tells me. \u201cThat\u2019s his grey area \u2014 we all have something we\u2019re contending with, but for Marty, I think he worries more about success than failure.\u201d\n\nWillmott explains that there\u2019s a balance between \u201cpromoting your work and navigating that world of sob stories and feeling objectified by the desire for [those stories].\u201d She notes that although courting exposure through the \u201coutsider art\u201d label seems necessary, it can also lead to awkward moments with buyers: if a piece looks too skilled or reminds them of an artist who\u2019s found mainstream acceptance, they might question its \u201coutsider\u201d status. \u201c\u2018Well, I could tell you the sob story about his life and how he struggles and was isolated and institutionalized,'\u201d she says, describing how those conversations tend to go. \u201cPeople seem scared that someone will sneak in that\u2019s had some kind of arts education \u2014 like God forbid that person wasn\u2019t just totally isolated their whole life and only suffered. It\u2019s really bizarre.\u201d\n\n***\n\nThe greatest recent conflation of artistry and mental illness helped define the very foundations of 20th-century artistic expression. Modernist ideals of mental illness \u201coccurred precisely when the distinctly modern disciplines of psychology, psychiatry, and psychoanalysis began to establish their scientific \u2018foundations\u2019 and to achieve the intellectual, institutional, and professional forms in which we largely know them today,\u201d writes Mark S. Micale in his 2003 book, The Mind of Modernism.\n\nIn 1922, German art historian-turned-psychiatrist Hans Prinzhorn published a book that would have widespread influence on modernism. Artistry of the Mentally Ill, which featured the works of ten schizophrenia patients from the Heidelberg Psychiatric Clinic, was published only a decade after the word \u201cschizophrenia\u201d was brought into existence by Eugen Bleuler: the surge of psychiatric diagnoses was accompanied by a swell of mimetic art that would overturn the most basic conceptions of what art had always been.\n\nThe book caught the eyes of modern artists like Alfred Kubin, Max Ernst, Paul Klee, Salvador Dali, and Jean Dubuffet, and a cursory glance at it could easily lead to the assumption that it is, itself, a catalog of a modern art exhibit, rather than a clinical collection. Dubuffet was so influenced by Artistry of the Mentally Ill that he later coined the term \u201cArt Brut,\u201d which propagated the idea that art was only valid if it was a projection of its creator\u2019s purest essences, and idealized the unfiltered work of the mentally ill as epitomizing this idea. \u201cArt Brut\u201d encompassed a body of work by people beyond the margins of art world norms: namely, psychiatric patients and children. Dubuffet rhapsodized about \u201cthose works created from solitude and from pure and authentic creative impulses\u201d \u2014 a notion linked specifically to the manic stages of bipolar, and perhaps more incorrectly to schizophrenia.\n\nIn \u201cBlinded Insights: On the Modernist Reception of the Art of the Mentally Ill,\u201d Hal Foster examines various modernist \u201cprojections that use the art of the mentally ill to propose a metaphysical essence of art.\u201d These interpretations, he suggests, \u201cobscure more than reveal the import of the art of the mentally ill.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Foster notes, modernist affiliations with the art of sufferers of mental illness were so deeply entrenched that the 1937 Nazi exhibition Degenerate Art \u2014 which accidentally became a major showcase for the artistic zeitgeist it scorned \u2014 \u201cattacked modernists like Klee, and\u2026 drew on images from the Prinzhorn collection in doing so.\u201d The difference, of course, was that while these artists\u2019 works were being stigmatized, hundreds of thousands of sufferers of mental illness were being systematically sterilized, and a few years later, transported to euthanasia centers.\n\nThough the trendiest trends within contemporary visual art have evolved past centralizing the artist \u2014 or even the viewer \u2014 as the subject, patrons of the various arts still tend to lionize pain as an expression of authenticity. The way people treat the music of Daniel Johnston, for example, often comes with an air of fetishism for the \u201cdevils\u201d he\u2019s experienced through his bipolar. Even for artists who\u2019ve not publicly suffered with mental health issues, personal tragedy often results in augmented interest: David Bowie\u2019s Blackstar skyrocketed in sales when people realized the album was written as Bowie was confronting imminent death, as opposed to abstractly meditating on mortality. The capacity to bolster an empathic culture is one of art\u2019s great potentials. But the value of pain also clearly has its complications. For mentally ill artists, it can make for another quandary to navigate and overcome.\n\n***\n\nNeither psychopharmacology nor art therapy really existed until the middle of the 20th century. Prior to that, the mentally ill had been brushed under the Victorian institutional rug, emerging only for theatricalized portraits by the likes of Charcot, and while modernism\u2019s projections of ideas about authenticity onto the mentally ill certainly increased mental illness\u2019 visibility, it didn\u2019t help patients so much as provide a subject of fascination for more mentally stable artists and patrons.\n\nBy the middle of the century, though, deinstitutionalization movements in the US and Europe, along with the advent of art therapy in the 1940s and the psychopharmacological boom of the 1950s, meant that people with mental illness were seeing a wider range of actual avenues toward stability. In a world where such avenues exist, romantic notions of the supposedly heightened, hyper-connected feelings that arise from mental illness seem more detrimental than liberating.\n\nThe advent of psychiatric medicine coincided with the advent of postmodernism. Postmodern ideas about the \u201cdeath of the author\u201d and the fluidity of the self certainly aren\u2019t at odds with the use of psychiatric medicine \u2014 if the self isn\u2019t seen as inalienable, the idea of somehow polluting one\u2019s access to it loses potency. Art has largely moved beyond modern notions of the self, and the mentally ill artist has thus \u2014 with advances in therapy and the increasing destigmatization of psychiatric medicine \u2014 moved beyond the institution.\n\nBut the legacy of the tortured-artist myth remains potent, perhaps because it\u2019s one of the foundations on which a movement as immense as modernism was based. This continues to lead artists grappling with mental illness to question whether to give in to dysfunction or find a stable way out of it.\n\n\u201cWith our advances in psychiatric treatment, I must acknowledge the tension that exists between our culture\u2019s attitude toward creativity, which is always extraordinarily positive, and our more ambivalent assessment of psychiatric treatment, which has both risks and benefits,\u201d writes psychiatrist and poet Richard M. Berlin in his introduction to Poets on Prozac, a collection of essays from poets on the effects of psychiatric medicine on their work, addressing both preliminary fears about medication and the writers\u2019 ultimate experiences on meds.\n\nBerlin discusses how \u201can entire generation of poets, including Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton, Robert Lowell, and Dylan Thomas\u2026 became famous for the dramatic excesses of their often ineffectively treated psychiatric disorders and substance abuse.\u201d He questions \u201cif our current treatment options would have altered the lives of these poets and enhanced their work, or if some poets may have avoided psychiatric treatment, fearing that treatment might have deleterious effects on their creativity.\u201d\n\nIn an email to me, Berlin writes: \u201cThe main common factor in highly creative people is motivation. It\u2019s the Thomas Edison \u20181% inspiration, 99% perspiration\u2019 [factor]. It\u2019s tough to be creative when you are having symptoms of mental illness, and the poets in my book were almost unanimous in their experience of medications being helpful for their creativity, mainly by not being so impaired by depression, anxiety, etc.\u201d He notes that, of course, medication is individualized and needs to be \u201cfine tuned\u201d and monitored \u201cto avoid side effects that can make a person dull.\u201d In his book, he quotes Plath, espousing a sentiment that was echoed throughout all of my interviews: \u201cWhen you are insane, you are busy being insane \u2014 all the time\u2026 When I was crazy, that\u2019s all I was.\u201d\n\nWillmott says she knows that artists with whom she works \u201cstruggle with that myth and the romanticism of being off their meds.\u201d Some, she suggests, \u201ctake it as a strength \u2014 maybe their mania, for example. And it\u2019s very dangerous.\u201d She explains that she\u2019s experienced bipolar disorder firsthand in her family, and is herself \u201creally familiar with feeling manic. Maybe at that moment you\u2019re going to be more \u2018productive,\u2019 but if you use all that energy, it\u2019s coming from somewhere. You can\u2019t just create energy out of nothing, and to recover from that, you can lose months and months.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/flavorwire-2016/img/ms-icon-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "I was startled one day, several months ago, when a new security guard in the usually\u00a0silent lobby of the Soho building that houses Flavorwire's offices said,\u00a0\"Good morning.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Flavorwire", "description": "I was startled one day, several months ago, when a new security guard in the usually\u00a0silent lobby of the Soho building that houses Flavorwire\u2019s offices said,\u00a0\u201cGood morning.\u201d", "title": "Beyond the Romantic Mythos, What Life Is Really Like for Artists Living With Mental Illness", "url": "http://flavorwire.com/562680/beyond-the-romantic-mythos-what-life-is-really-like-for-artists-living-with-mental-illness", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://flavorwire.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/jean-dubuffet.png?w=1200", "height": 912}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://flavorwire.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/jean-dubuffet.png?w=640"}, "site": "@flavorwire", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@flavorwire"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "p": {"domain_verify": "d14fb4bfdccbc45ec9b9cf467123426d"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://flavorwire.com/feed;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/5af1ea63c8deb1c43404735fce2401ed?s=16", "application-name": "Flavorwire", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2016-02-29T21:00:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-01T15:51:20+00:00"}, "keywords": "art, fountain house gallery, hal foster, jonathan glass, martin cohen, newsletter, paul klee", "google-site-verification": "LEPlfEAe87ZYYO-w5cvjSSIHi6-qE8orVaxsi6TkE9Y", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "news_keywords": "Fountain House Gallery, Jonathan Glass Art, Jonathan Glass Jazz, Mental Illness Art, Mental Illness Modernism"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s really bizarre.\u201d***The greatest recent conflation of artistry and mental illness helped define the very foundations of 20th-century artistic expression.\nMany artists don\u2019t necessarily want to be pinned as an \u2018outsider\u2019 artist living with mental illness.\nIn a world where such avenues exist, romantic notions of the supposedly heightened, hyper-connected feelings that arise from mental illness seem more detrimental than liberating.\nThis continues to lead artists grappling with mental illness to question whether to give in to dysfunction or find a stable way out of it.\nThe mythical conflation of mental illness and creativity made me fear that making emotionally impactful art and being emotionally impacted \u2014 to the point of dysfunction \u2014 were inextricable."}
