Ricky Gervais keeps pushing. Joking about what a loon Mel Gibson is hardly rare in Hollywood circles, but Gervais decided to do it just as he was introducing him.

“A few years ago I made a joke about Mel Gibson getting a bit drunk and saying a few unsavory things,” Gervais said. “We’ve all done it. I wasn’t judging him, but now I find myself in the awkward position to introduce him again. Listen I’m sure its embarrassing for both of us and I blame NBC for this terrible situation, Mel blames … well we know who Mel blames.” That’s right, Gervais was clearly calling out Gibson’s history of anti-semitism.

“Listen, I still feel bad about it,” Gervais continued. “Mel’s forgotten all about it. That’s what drinking does. I want to say something nice about Mel before he comes out: I’d rather have a drink with him in his hotel tonight than Bill Cosby.”
