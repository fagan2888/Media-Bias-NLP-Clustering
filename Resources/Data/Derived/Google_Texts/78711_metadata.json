Broncos coach John Fox left impressed with his new crew of players as they dropped the curtain Sunday on the rookies\u2019 practices.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really so much mental for young guys. They are new to us and new to our terminology,\u201d Fox said. \u201cRepetition is very important. They came in last Monday, and this weekend it was great because we are short on people so they get every rep.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos drafted six players last week. Cornerback Bradley Roby was taken in the first round, and will be expected to contribute this season. Denver is working with Roby on improving his ball-recognition skills \u2014 \u201cGetting his eyes right so he doesn\u2019t get beat on double moves,\u201d explained defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio. Roby impressed in his early snapshot.\n\n\u201cHe has great skills,\u201d Fox said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s been really pleasant in the way he\u2019s conducted himself in meetings and throughout the building.\u201d\n\nThere are few days that pass without Fox getting asked about Peyton Manning. You\u2019ve probably heard of him. Sunday was not an exception as Fox said he heard some of Manning\u2019s address at the University of Virginia commencement on Saturday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a busy guy in the offseason I have come to realize. It\u2019s all good. I look forward to seeing him (Monday),\u201d Fox said. \u201cHe\u2019s amazing. His time management skills are off the chart. It doesn\u2019t surprise me (that does so many public events) because I see how he operates in our building. And that gives you pretty good idea how he is off the field.\u201d\n\nTroy E.
