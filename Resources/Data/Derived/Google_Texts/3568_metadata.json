It\u2019s an immovable feature of the political landscape, and navigating around or through it is emerging as a key test for a party desperate to improve its dismal standing with a vital and growing share of the American electorate \u2014 and the subject of growing alarm among Republican leaders, operatives, and activists.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s highly questionable whether we\u2019re treated fairly on Univision,\u201d RNC chairman Reince Priebus told BuzzFeed News, adding that the party was going to keep at it. \u201cYou can fight all day long with people, not to say that that wouldn\u2019t continue, but at the same time you still have to get your message out.\u201d\n\nDemocrats see the dynamic just as clearly.\n\n\u201cThe GOP needs Univision more than Univision needs the GOP,\u201d said Democratic pollster Fernand Amandi. \u201cFor a party looking to be competitive nationally again, they can\u2019t risk alienating the premier outlet that caters to the fastest-growing part of the electorate.\u201d\n\nThe scale of the Republicans\u2019 problem is hard to question. Univision reaches three times as many 18- to 49-year-old Hispanic adults with its flagship national news broadcast as CBS, NBC, and ABC do with their evening newscasts combined. The network reaches 96% of Hispanic households; 72% of Univision\u2019s primetime audience does not watch any of the top-rated English-language newscasts.\n\n\u201cAfter the Catholic Church, the next thing [American Latinos] trust the most is Univision,\u201d Univision News senior vice president Daniel Coronell told BuzzFeed News.\n\nThe network has a direct connection to the likely Democratic Party nominee for president. Univision\u2019s part-owner, Haim Saban, is one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s staunchest supporters. Of the former secretary of state, Saban once told an Israeli newspaper, \u201cSeeing her in the White House is a big dream of mine.\u201d There are also formal connections: Univision partnered with the Clinton Foundation for an early education initiative in 2014.\n\nRepublicans, by and large, declined to criticize Univision on the record, citing its power. But speaking on the condition of anonymity, Republican operatives run down a litany of complaints, always returning to Univision\u2019s emphasis on immigration and the way the network\u2019s highest-profile journalist, Jorge Ramos, acts as an advocate on the issue.\n\n\u201cImmigration dictates their coverage,\u201d said a senior GOP source, a complaint made repeatedly to BuzzFeed News by Republicans. \u201cWe just took the Senate in Colorado, we just took the U.S. Senate, but Univision will generalize our platform as us not wanting to fund Obama\u2019s executive order,\u201d the source said of Republican opposition to the president\u2019s immigration actions.\n\nThe senior GOP source pointed to Colorado\u2019s first-ever Spanish-language debate, which was hosted by Univision in October, between Republican Mike Coffman and Democrat Andrew Romanoff. Immigration questions dominated the debate.\n\nThere have also been high-profile battles on other topics. In 2011, the network planned to report on the decades-old drug bust of Rubio\u2019s brother-in-law, but offered to approach on-air coverage of the story differently \u2014 if Rubio agreed to an interview with Ramos. The story aired and Rubio went on with Ramos the next year in an interview that became contentious over the issue.\n\nIt is the focus on immigration, in particular, that grates on Republicans, in part because they say it contrasts so sharply with what Univision executives tell them when they\u2019re asking for ad dollars. In the fall of 2013, less than a year after President Obama carried 71% of the Latino vote, for instance, Republican officials listened at the Capitol Hill Club to a presentation from two people: Keith Norman, a vice president from Univision, and an outside pollster for the network. The message was simple: Immigration, according to the polling, wasn\u2019t the top issue for Latinos. Jobs and the economy, education, and health care all ranked higher.\n\nThe pitch, the kind party officials had received before and received again in 2014, was clear \u2014 spend money with Univision to reach Latino voters in competitive congressional races in places like Florida, Arizona, Colorado, and Texas.\n\nThe Republican officials grumbled, then decided they had no choice, and bought digital ads on Univision.com and 30-second audio ads on Univision\u2019s music radio app Uforia in Miami, hitting the president on Obamacare.\n\nUnivision News\u2019 Coronell, a former high-profile journalist in Colombia, defended the network\u2019s coverage as fair, saying Republicans aren\u2019t the only ones complaining. He pointed to Ramos\u2019 sharp coverage of Obama\u2019s immigration record and their last sitdown interview as just the latest example of the Democratic administration\u2019s ongoing frustration with Univision.\n\n\u201cSome of the members of the White House communications team felt that Jorge was not respectful enough to the president and very insistent and picky with his questions,\u201d Coronell said. \u201cJorge Ramos asked about deportations numbers, he asked why he took so long to make this decision. The role of journalism is to ask, to be the counterweight to the politicians.\u201d\n\nCoronell repeated a common refrain: The network has a standing invitation to top Republican officials. He downplayed the issue of Saban, the Clinton donor and Univision owner.\n\n\u201cWith respect to Mr. Saban, Mr. Saban is not involved with editorial decisions at Univision,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a serious company, he is very respectful to our journalistic independence. He\u2019s not connected with our day to day; we\u2019re not in this to build his happiness.\u201d\n\nUnivision representatives told BuzzFeed News the network\u2019s partnership with the Clinton Foundation also includes former Republican Sen. Bill Frist and Cindy McCain, the wife of Sen. John McCain, who are part of the Too Small to Fail leadership advisory council. (Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was approached for an education partnership, too, a Republican source said, but the talks never advanced.) The network also pointed to a Hispanic employment event it did with Gov. Chris Christie in New Jersey as evidence of broader political cooperation.", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 3573956, "userid": 741910}, "description": "The network's ties to Hillary Clinton, treatment of Marco Rubio, and singular focus on immigration give Republicans fits.
