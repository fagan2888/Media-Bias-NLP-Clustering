The extension does not exempt people from paying the 2014 tax penalty, but would help them avoid bigger penalties in 2015.\n\nEnrollment was previously extended until Sunday for people who did not complete their application by the Feb. 15 deadline.\n\nSo far, 1.4 million Californians have signed up for private insurance, short of the agency\u2019s 1.7 million goal.\n\nThe federal exchange also extended enrollment from March 15 to April 30.\n\n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
