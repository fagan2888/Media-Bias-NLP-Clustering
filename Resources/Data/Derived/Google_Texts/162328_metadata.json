Jeff Miller (R-Fla.) announced his retirement last month, three Republican and two Democratic millennials have stepped up to the challenge of filling his shoes.\n\nRebekah Johansen Bydlak, Matt Gaetz, and James Zumwalt are running in the Republican primary, while Amanda Kondrat\u2019yev and Steven Specht are running for the Democratic nomination.\n\nGaetz is the only candidate running with previous experience as an elected official. The 33-year old has been a member of the Florida House of Representatives since 2010, and has become known for his defense of the Second Amendment and his attempts to implement \u201copen carry\u201d laws in Florida.\n\nEven though Gaetz is the only elected official, Bydlak and Zumwalt both have experience working in politics.\n\nIf elected, Bydlak would be the youngest member of Congress. She has spent several years in Washington D.C. working as the outreach director for the Coalition to Reduce Government Spending, and before that she was the Florida State Co-Chair of the Young Americans for Liberty. Her priorities include tackling the debt, repealing Common Core, and repealing Obamacare.\n\nZumwalt, a decorated Navy veteran, also has some political experience. According to FloridaPolitics.com, he served as a military-oriented legislative aide to the outgoing congressman, and has made national security and veterans\u2019 issues key parts of his platform.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Kondrat\u2019yev is a proud Bernie Sanders supporters and single mother. While she doesn\u2019t have an issues page on her website, Kondrat\u2019yev has stated that she wants to tackle income inequality, pollution, and \u201coppressive school-to-prison pipelines.\u201d\n\nSpecht, the other Democrat in the race, is a military veteran who served in Iraq. He\u2019s promised to fight for reinvesting in infrastructure, tackling the national debt, and increasing job creation. The 33-year-old is running without a clear ideology, saying that both liberals and conservatives have good points.\n\n\u201cThere are merits to limited government and there are merits to big government,\u201d Specht told The Pulse Gulf Coast. \u201cHowever, no matter what government we have, we need to pay for it. The last two presidents both doubled the national debt while in office, destroying a budget surplus brokered by a Republican Congress and President Bill Clinton. Fifteen years of foolish fiscal policy will saddle my children and my grandchildren with a burden they didn\u2019t earn if we don\u2019t act sooner than later.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Image via Red Alert Politics If millennials are looking for their generation\u2019s future political leaders, it\u2019s likely that they\u2019ll find them in Florida\u2019s 1st Congressional District \u2014 where there are five Gen Y candidates running in the primaries.
