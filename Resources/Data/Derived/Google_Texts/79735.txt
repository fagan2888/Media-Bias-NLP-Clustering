Weld County Sheriff investigators combed through a vehicle with a shattered window on Interstate 25 Sunday and found no bullet.

A spokesman said they’re treating all windshield incidents this way in the wake of recent highway shootings that authorities believe may be linked.

During April, the sheriff’s office received reports of 22 broken windshields, about 13 of those along I-25, sheriff’s spokesman Sean Standridge said.

No figures have been compiled yet for May because county investigators are focused the May 18 killing of a man riding his bike near Windsor, Standridge said. Another man was shot and killed in Loveland Wednesday night.

“Any time someone’s window is shattered, we go through the car with a fine-toothed comb. You never know,” he said.

This practice began after a woman was shot in the neck in April, he said. She survived. “We treat every single one like a crime scene. We lock it down.”

On Sunday, investigators worked over a car after a woman driving with a friend reported that her driver side window shattered as she drove and that she suspected it had been shot out. No injuries were reported.

That incident occurred at mile marker 250 on I-25, around 10 a.m., the sheriff’s office said.

“Driver reported her window may have been shot out at 10 a.m., driver side window, no injuries,” a country tweet report said.

The friend told 7News, asking that he not be identified, that he heard what sounded like an “explosion” as the window shattered.

“There was just a big explosion. I mean, a real loud bang,” the man said. “The window just disintegrated. I was in shock at the time.”

Many drivers have called in reports of shattered windows on moving vehicles since the 20-year-old Milliken woman was shot in the neck April 22 through her front driver’s side window while driving southbound on I- 25 through Larimer County.
