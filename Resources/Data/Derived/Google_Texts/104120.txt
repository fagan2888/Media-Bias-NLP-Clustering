ELGIN, Ill. (AP) — A hefty fundraising shortfall has dashed plans to send a replica of Abraham Lincoln’s funeral train car to trace the journey that brought the assassinated president’s body back to Springfield, Illinois, from Washington.

The 2015 Lincoln Funeral Train organization had planned to recreate the trip as part of commemorations in April of the 150th anniversary of the president’s death. But fundraising efforts fell $100,000 short of the $250,000 needed.

Master mechanic David Kloke in Elgin, Illinois, has spent about six years building the replica. The train car is still scheduled to be displayed at a May fundraising gala at a Springfield hotel, but it’s unclear whether it will have a place in the official commemorative events in the state capital, the (Arlington Heights) Daily Herald reported (http://bit.ly/1MU8eRR ).

“We’re disappointed, for sure,” said Shannon Brown, spokeswoman for The 2015 Lincoln Funeral Train, which has backed Kloke in the project. “We wanted to be in Washington.”

The replica is made from steel and wood and is 48 feet long and 13 feet tall. Kloke studied drawings and photos to build it with the help of volunteers.
