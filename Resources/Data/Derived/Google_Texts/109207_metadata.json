Carter and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin E. Dempsey outlined and defended the Obama administration\u2019s strategy against ISIS.\n\nWhile Dempsey believes the U.S. military response to defeat ISIS is \u201cappropriately matched to the complexity of the environment,\u201d Carter conceded that the execution of the Defense Department\u2019s strategy \u201ccan and will be strengthened.\u201d\n\nBut lawmakers are critical of U.S. training programs in the region meant to bolster Iraq\u2019s security forces and help local Syrians join the fight.\n\nBy June 30, the U.S. had trained about 8,800 Iraqi soldiers.\n\nIn Syria, on the other hand, only 60 fighters have been trained in this program.\n\nCarter claims that stringent U.S. vetting standards for fighters can be blamed for the low turnout of eligible locals.\n\nParticipants must pass counterintelligence screenings, have no history of committing atrocities and possess a willingness to engage in the military campaign in a way that is compliant with the law of armed conflict.\n\nRegardless of the reasons for a lack of Syrian participants, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., called the train and equip program \u201canemic and suffering.\u201d\n\nCarter defended the administration\u2019s efforts by describing the three components of the administration\u2019s plan to beat ISIS.\n\nThe first priority is on the diplomatic front, with the State Department taking the lead on compelling the Iraqi and Syrian governments to become more inclusive and better support its citizens.\n\nMcCain criticized the administration for not putting a greater emphasis on military strategy.\n\n\u201cSecurity on the ground is a precondition to political reconciliation, not the other way around,\u201d McCain said.\n\nThe administration\u2019s military strategy centers around beating back ISIS\u2019 attempts at having a safe haven in the region, and simultaneously building local partnerships in Iraq and Syria to enable locals to wage their own war against the terrorist group.\n\n\u201cEnduring stability in the Middle East cannot be imposed by the outside in,\u201d Dempsey said.\n\nThe other way the U.S. military is engaging in the conflict with ISIS is through a series of airstrikes, a tactic that has had varying levels of success.\n\nMcCain cited the statistic that of the 5,000 attempted airstrikes against ISIS, 75 percent of American pilots return to their base without ever dropping a weapon.\n\nHe sees this as a waste of resources and as a missed opportunity in pushing back the terrorist group throughout the Middle East.\n\nCarter clarified that of the deliberate airstrikes\u2014that is, the raids where one knows what the target will be when the aircraft embarks\u2014there is a 93 percent success rate in achieving the objective.\n\nHowever, when the airstrikes are dynamic and the aircraft is deployed without the assurance of a target, the success rate moves down to 37 percent.\n\nMcCain urged Dempsey and Carter to install U.S. air controllers on the ground in order to increase accuracy of targets hit.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not winning,\u201d McCain said. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re not winning in a war, you\u2019re losing.\u201d\n\nSen. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., followed up by attesting that even though Iraqi armed forces outnumber ISIS fighters, Iraqis still struggle to win contested battles.\n\nHe specifically mentioned Ramadi, a key Sunni city in Iraq that has been seized by ISIS.\n\n\u201c[We have to be] making sure the Iraqi forces know that there\u2019s no back door anymore,\u201d Donnelly said, suggesting that Iraqis must commit their own citizens to the fight against ISIS, rather than depend on the U.S.\n\nAlthough senators on the committee and representatives of the Obama administration disagreed on many aspects of the ISIS strategy, everybody at the hearing agreed that American leadership in the Middle East is a necessity.\n\n\u201cThe global security environment is as uncertain as I\u2019ve ever seen it,\u201d Dempsey said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Defense Secretary Carter and Joint Chiefs Chair Dempsey defend Obama\u2019s ISIS strategy to Congress, receiving considerable blowback.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Defense Secretary Carter and Joint Chiefs Chair Dempsey defend Obama\u2019s ISIS strategy to Congress, receiving considerable blowback.", "title": "What Is the Obama Administration\u2019s ISIS Strategy?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/ISIS-Feature-Edit.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-07T18:00:12+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1gmigQz"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Defense Secretary Carter and Joint Chiefs Chair Dempsey defend Obama\u2019s ISIS strategy to Congress, receiving considerable blowback.", "title": "What Is the Obama Administration\u2019s ISIS Strategy?", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/ISIS-Feature-Edit.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "terrorism", "published_time": "2015-07-07T16:37:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-07T18:00:12+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "ISIS, senate, terrorism, Dempsey, Carter, McCain, Middle East, Iraq, Syria"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1094\"", "article_summary": "During a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing this morning, Defense Secretary Ashton B.
