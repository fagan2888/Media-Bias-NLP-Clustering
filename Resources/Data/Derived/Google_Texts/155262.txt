UPDATED with ratings: About 149,000 of those 809,000 viewers who watched Lawrence O’Donnell’s emotional return to MSNBC fell in the news demo. His numbers were up 11% over the network’s June-to-date in the demo and 39% over MSNB’s June to date in total viewers.

In his return, O’Donnell described the taxi accident in which he and his brother were injured. He also talked about David Koch, who’d given large sums of money to the hospital at which O’Donnell was treated. In April, MSNBC said O’Donnell would be off the air for several weeks while he recovered from the crash, which happened while he vacationing out of the country.

His Last Word comeback beat CNN Tonight at 10 PM. But he got pounded by FNC’s Hannity, which virtually doubled O’Donnell’s return in overall audience (1.562 million viewers) and nearly quadrupled him in demo viewers (400,000 demo viewers).
