SANAA, Yemen (AP) — Yemeni officials say a series of pre-dawn Saudi-led airstrikes targeting the headquarters of Yemen’s armed forces in the rebel-held capital have killed at least 22 people.

They said the dead were mostly soldiers and that the Sunday airstrikes damaged several nearby homes and shook the entire city.

The security and hospital officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.

The U.S.-backed coalition began launching airstrikes on March 26 against the Iranian-backed Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, and their allies in the military and security forces. The Houthis seized Sanaa in September and later captured much of northern Yemen before advancing on the south in March.
