Panama City Beach, FL---The Aquatic Center at Frank Brown Park has been the home of the 2014 U.S. Masters Synchronized Swimming championships from Thursday through Sunday.

Challengers come from not just the States, but all over the world, all going after titles in their respective events, including duets, trios, solos, and combo competitions. Age groups across the competitions include swimmers range from 20-29 years old to 80-89 year olds.

While many of the athletes have impressed in the water, it's a duo from the other side of the world who's stolen the show.

Maya and Saya Kimura, 27 year old twins from Japan, fittingly nicknamed the Mermaid Twins, have been involved in "syncro" since they were three years old.

The duet won the International Swimming Federation World Championships in Montreal, Canada last summer. This fall, they're here making their third trip to Florida, yet their first time to Panama City Beach, hoping to continue to grow their sport.

"We want to attend more and more meets," says Maya. "Also, in Japan, synchronized swimming is not really big. So we want to make it more popular and have more children start taking up synchronized swimming. So we want to make it big."

The Kimura's took first place in the duets final.

The final event in the meet tomorrow is the team competition, which is set to begin at 9:00 AM and running till noon.
