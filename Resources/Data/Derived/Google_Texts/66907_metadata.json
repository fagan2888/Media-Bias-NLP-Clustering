In this excerpt from Marc Spitz\u2019s newly released \"Twee: The Gentle Revolution in Music, Books, Television, Fashion and Film\" (IT/Harper Collins) the story of how the square-jawed leading man gave way to the sexually fumbling, awkward but no less heroic leading men and how any femme fatales left among the equally awkward leading ladies had to learn to deal with them.\n\nBeginning with the very early days of the AIDS crisis, Hollywood seemed to presciently churn out more and more teen-angst or teen-confusion-based entertainment, featuring sex-terrified boys (Tom Cruise in \u201cRisky Business\u201d) on the cusp of manhood and confused girls (Jennifer Jason Leigh in \u201cFast Times at Ridgemont High\u201d) on the cusp of womanhood. These characters became the surrogates for a new generation of teens who were experiencing similar emotions in their real lives. It\u2019s as if the times forced films into frankness. New Wave music, which featured on many of these film soundtracks, was a step ahead (Sparks\u2019 \u201cAngst in My Pants,\u201d the Gleaming Spires\u2019 \u201cAre You Ready for the Sex Girls?\u201d), but by mid-decade, the screen stars were all Devo. Nerds, the proto Twees were ready for their close-up.\n\nOn MTV, the sexy librarian wasn\u2019t sexy until she let her hair down, took off the glasses, and kicked it with ZZ Top or Van Halen. But in film, the librarians were slowly winning out.\n\nPart of the reason 1982\u2019s \u201cFast Times at Ridgemont High\u201d remains, three decades on, the most transformative teen film ever made is that it highlights this shift in sexual power. This is embodied by the dynamic between Robert Romanus\u2019s slick, strutting, fast-talking Mike Damone and Brian Backer\u2019s mole-like Mark Ratner, the hapless, virginal movie-theater usher. \u201cRat\u201d is the only one who gets the girl in the end, even if they still don\u2019t go all the way. Meanwhile Judge Reinhold\u2019s Brad, a \u201csingle successful guy,\u201d loses his job, and, in the film\u2019s most famous scene, is sexually humiliated by Phoebe Cates when she walks in on him pleasuring himself. And Damone, as Cates\u2019s Linda scrawls on his locker for all to see, is just a \u201clittle prick.\u201d\n\nRolling Stone journalist turned filmmaker Cameron Crowe, then not too long out of his teens himself, went undercover at a real Southern California high school to deliver the book \u201cFast Times at Ridgemont High,\u201d then later adapted the screenplay for Universal Studios. Bronx-bred director Amy Heckerling turned Crowe\u2019s script into a teen comic and a Twee milestone that would inform every other teen film that came later, from \u201cRisky Business\u201d to the John Hughes oeuvre. Jocks were on their sprint out.\n\n\u201cCameron Crowe\u2019s book set the tone,\u201d says Eric Stoltz, who appears along with future \u201cRevenge of the Nerds\u201d star Anthony Edwards as one of Jeff Spicoli\u2019s shirtless surfer buds, refused service at All American Burger (\u201cNo shirt, no shoes . . . no dice\u201d). \u201cIt was rooted in the reality of the characters and situations. We were lucky enough to have Cameron on set every day, and he and Amy Heckerling were intent on making something true to life, rather than formulaic.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no huge thing, it\u2019s just sex,\u201d Linda reassures Stacy as she prepares to lose her virginity, but everyone, even Linda (with her mysterious, off-camera, and possibly imaginary boyfriend), knows this is a lie. Hormones drive the film. Sean Penn\u2019s Spicoli has ripped-out Playboy centerfolds taped to his bedroom wall; the film\u2019s resident Buddha, zinc on his nose, has lust in his heart. Like the work of Dr. Seuss and Maurice Sendak, \u201cFast Times\u201d is both sweet and, even with its occasionally broad, sketchy humor, painfully real. \u201cIf this film has a theme,\u201d the powerful New Yorker magazine film critic Pauline Kael wrote, \u201cit\u2019s sexual embarrassment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t help doing what feels right to me [even] if it came out as awkward or sweet,\u201d Heckerling says. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t occur to me to make those kinds of moments wacky.\u201d\n\nAs with most future Twee films, from \u201cHeathers\u201d to Heckerling\u2019s later foray into the world of unusually sensitive teens, \u201cClueless,\u201d the adult characters are ridiculous. This is a very common Twee trope. In \u201cFast Times,\u201d there\u2019s Mr. Hand (Ray Walston), who greets people with \u201cAloha,\u201d and is convinced that half his student body is \u201con dope.\u201d There\u2019s Mr. Vargas (Vincent Schiavelli), who digs lustily into cadavers and has just switched to Sanka. There are coaches, absent parents, obnoxious patrons at fast-food joints.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking I wasn\u2019t going to do a movie that was different than all other youth movies or anything like that,\u201d Heckerling says. \u201cI can only do what I come up with or feel.\u201d It\u2019s really the \u201cyouth\u201d that Heckerling mentions that make \u201cFast Times\u201d different, the literal freshness of Crowe and Heckerling and their game cast of future superstars.\n\n\u201c\u2019Fast Times\u2019 tested horribly,\u201d Heckerling recalls of the advance previews major studios routinely do before releasing a film. \u201cI showed the movie in Orange County, and it was unanimous. On all the cards, they said we were horrible Hollywood people making teenagers into sluts and druggies.
