This year, the non-partisan youth engagement group\u2019s PSA for midterm elections has a very 2014 take, in which\u2026\n\n1) We all get Lil Jon\u2019s \u201cTurn Down For What\u201d stuck in our heads again. Except this time it\u2019s \u201cTurn Out For What,\u201d allowing celebrities to name drop issues they care about.\n\n2) The celebs are not a group likely to be seen in the same YouTube video for any other occasion: actors, a fitness trainer, a dancer, indie musicians, a model, a reality star and Whoopi Goldberg (her own category).\n\n3) We get a glimpse into the minds of the Rock the Vote execs and what they think it takes to draw millennials to the polls: reproductive rights, prison reform and not to be taken lightly, marijuana legalization.\n\n\u201cLong before President Obama went on Behind Two Ferns to talk about the Affordable Care Act, Rock the Vote was pioneering the concept of using pop culture to drive interest in participation,\u201d says Rock the Vote spokesperson Audrey Gelman.\n\nThe art of the \u201cget out the vote\u201d video is something Rock the Vote has had down since the beginning, when it first started making celebrity-laden TV commercials that aired on \u201cYo! MTV Raps.\u201d Back then, the channel couldn\u2019t get advertisers to buy air time on its first-ever hip hop show, so they gave the spots to Rock the Vote for free.\n\nLuckily, the internet has saved these gems for nostalgic viewing pleasure \u2014 and for examination of what issues Rock the Vote once thought the kids would run to the polls for.\n\n1990\n\nIn their inaugural video spot (also during a midterm election) Rock the Vote\u2019s co-founder Jeff Ayeroff asked Madonna and music video director Paula Greif to get involved. He didn\u2019t give directions and they came back with this: Madonna in a red swimsuit and some guys in jorts remixing \u201cVogue\u201d to tell us \u201cfreedom of speech is as good as sex.\u201d\n\n1992\n\nRobert Downey Jr. and Sarah Jessica Parker have been positioned in front of a cloth backdrop to motivate you to go to the polls over this important issue of their time:\n\n\u201cOur own government is trying to tell you what you should and shouldn\u2019t pop into your tape deck!\u201d\n\n1996\n\n\u201cPower, real power\u201d that\u2019s what Chuck D of Public Enemy wants you to know you have.\n\n2000\n\nThis PSA targets Latino voters, trying to motivate them to register to vote by mixing the conflict in Vietnam and music from Santana.\n\n2008\n\nThis is around when Rock the Vote begins started packing more celebrities into each video for maximum impact. The idea: appeal to everyone.\n\n2009\n\nAs the Affordable Care Act was working its way through Congress, Rock the Vote attempted to motivate 20-somethings to give a care about heath care. Who better than the stars of \u201cScrubs,\u201d talking about their nipples?\n\n2012\n\nOr, the year that it didn\u2019t matter what celebrities said, as long as there were celebrities. The first PSA is just a bunch of generic statements like \u201cwe will be brave\u201d and \u201cwe will matter\u201d without any mention of the issues. Then a follow up on Funny or Die, where instead the explanations turn to \u201cRyan Gosling\u201d and \u201cmakes your hands stronger for tweeting.\u201d\n\nAnd we\u2019re back to 2014. As co-founder Ayeroff puts it, \u201cThe way the message is delivered has changed, but the message has stayed the same.\u201d Go vote.
