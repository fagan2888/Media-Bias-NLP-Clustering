Schmitt called Dyson\u2019s comments \u201cmean-spirited\u201d and \u201creckless\u201d in a statement for TheWrap.\n\n\u201cMichael Eric Dyson, who has been a persistent critic of Mr. Cosby\u2019s call for responsibility in the African-American community, has stated that Mr. Cosby\u2019s request for neutrality is part of what he calls Mr. Cosby\u2019s \u2018rape [of the ] entire black community.\u2019 Mr. Cosby understands that Mr. Dyson does not agree with Mr. Cosby\u2019s views, but such mean-spirited and reckless rhetoric cannot go unchallenged by responsible people and journalists,\u201d Schmitt\u2019s statement read.\n\nSee photos: Bill Cosby\u2019s NBC Sitcom Is Dead: 10 Other TV Dads Who Adopted a New Family (Photos)\n\nOn Wednesday\u2019s \u201cNow With Alex Wagner,\u201d Dyson commented on Cosby\u2019s call over the weekend for black media to remain \u201cneutral\u201d in covering the mounting sexual allegations against the comedian.\n\n\u201cThe very kind of man who would rape women, allegedly, is the same kind of man who will rape an entire black community, poor black people who are vulnerable before him, using his powerful foot to clump down on their necks,\u201d Dyson Said.\n\nThe rest of Schmitt\u2019s statement sought to further explain Cosby\u2019s comments about black media\u2019s coverage of the allegations against him.\n\nSee video: Jon Stewart Likens Congress to Bill Cosby: They Both Slip Toxic Things in While No One Is Looking\n\n\u201cTo be clear, Mr. Cosby did not ask for special treatment from the African-American media,\u201d the statement read. \u201cTo the contrary, he asked that they adhere to journalistic standards and approach the story in a neutral manner \u2013 without a predisposition on either side of the story. It is of course what we would expect of all media. Those words, which are clear on their face and with which any fair-minded person would have to agree, have now been the source of even greater criticism of Mr. Cosby.\u201d\n\nCosby \u2014 who until this past weekend had stayed silent on the sexual assault accusations against him, allowing his lawyers to issue statements on his behalf \u2014 spoke for a short time on Saturday to Stacy Brown, a freelance writer from the New York Post who also writes for African-American media outlets.\n\n\u201cLet me say this,\u201d Cosby told Brown. \u201cI only expect the black media to uphold the standards of excellence in journalism and when you do that you have to go in with a neutral mind.\u201d\n\nAlso read: Bill Cosby Accuser Fires Back at Camille Cosby: He\u2019s \u2018Not the Man I Thought I Knew\u2019\n\nCosby\u2019s attorney\u2019s has since said that the comedian did not know he was being recorded and did not know that the reporter was calling on behalf of the New York Post as opposed to an African-American media agency.\n\nBrown did not deny any part of the attorney\u2019s statement.\n\nWatch Dyson\u2019s interview.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bill-cosby-michael-eric-dyson-rape-black-media-150x150.png", "sailthru.author": "Jethro Nededog", "description": "The news channel contributor and academic accused the TV comedian of \"raping\" the black community", "generator": "WooFramework 6.2.0", "og": {"site_name": "TheWrap", "description": "The news channel contributor and academic accused the TV comedian of \"raping\" the black community", "title": "Bill Cosby Attorney Blasts MSNBC's Michael Eric Dyson as 'Mean-Spirited,' 'Reckless' (Video)", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 618, "identifier": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bill-cosby-michael-eric-dyson-rape-black-media.png", "height": 412}, "updated_time": "2014-12-18T18:30:12+00:00", "url": "http://www.thewrap.com/bill-cosby-attorney-blasts-msnbcs-michael-eric-dyson-as-mean-spirited-reckless-video/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The news channel contributor and academic accused the TV comedian of &#8220;raping&#8221; the black community", "creator": "@therealjethro", "url": "http://www.thewrap.com/bill-cosby-attorney-blasts-msnbcs-michael-eric-dyson-as-mean-spirited-reckless-video/", "image": {"src": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bill-cosby-michael-eric-dyson-rape-black-media-340x300.png", "identifier": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bill-cosby-michael-eric-dyson-rape-black-media-340x300.png"}, "title": "Bill Cosby Attorney Blasts MSNBC\u2019s Michael Eric Dyson as \u2018Mean-Spirited,\u2019 \u2018Reckless\u2019 (Video)", "site": "@thewrap", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-12-19T02:10:44+00:00", "sailthru.title": "Bill Cosby Attorney Blasts MSNBC\u2019s Michael Eric Dyson as \u2018Mean-Spirited,\u2019 \u2018Reckless\u2019 (Video)", "wp-parsely_version": "1.6", "fb": {"app_id": 228236404181023}, "google-site-verification": "-PpFSIrGHybVDxbndrL6MCngw3j6BXdy0xDVBVVOacI", "sailthru.tags": "bill cosby,michael eric dyson", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/thewrap", "section": "TV", "tag": "Michael Eric Dyson", "published_time": "2014-12-18T18:10:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-18T18:30:12+00:00"}, "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Bill Cosby Attorney Blasts MSNBC\u2019s Michael Eric Dyson as \u2018Mean-Spirited,\u2019 \u2018Reckless\u2019 (Video)\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/www.thewrap.com\\/bill-cosby-attorney-blasts-msnbcs-michael-eric-dyson-as-mean-spirited-reckless-video\\/\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.thewrap.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/12\\/bill-cosby-michael-eric-dyson-rape-black-media-150x150.png\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"394448\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-12-19T02:10:44Z\",\"section\":\"TV\",\"author\":\"Jethro Nededog\",\"tags\":[\"bill cosby\",\"michael eric dyson\"]}", "sailthru.category": "videos,tv", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bill-cosby-michael-eric-dyson-rape-black-media.png", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=6.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "See video: Jon Stewart Likens Congress to Bill Cosby: They Both Slip Toxic Things in While No One Is Looking\u201cTo be clear, Mr. Cosby did not ask for special treatment from the African-American media,\u201d the statement read.\nAttorney John P.
