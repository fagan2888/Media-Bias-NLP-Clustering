1. Virginia to stop defending gay marriage ban in court

Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring's office said Thursday he would stop defending the state's ban on gay marriage against challenges in federal court because he had concluded that it was unconstitutional. Herring spokesman Michael Kelly said the state — a battleground in the fight over same-sex marriage — would instead side with plaintiffs trying to get the ban struck down. Herring's decision came a string of victories for gay marriage supporters, including the rejection by federal judges of bans in Utah and Oklahoma. [Associated Press]

4. Millions of Americans learn they qualify for government health plans

More than 6.3 million Americans were found to be eligible for Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program between the Oct. 1 launch of ObamaCare and the end of 2013, according to federal figures released Wednesday. Not all of the increase was attributed to the Affordable Care Act, though. Health policy analysts say another big factor was the "out-of-the-woodwork effect" — people who discovered they already qualified for government healthcare plans when they inquired about ObamaCare options.

5. Tanaka signs with the Yankees for $155 million

Masahiro Tanaka has accepted a $155 million, seven-year contract with the New York Yankees. The deal is the fifth largest ever for a pitcher, and the biggest for any player coming over from Japan.

7. Texas executes Mexican national despite diplomatic protest

Texas executed a Mexican national, Edgar Tamayo, late Wednesday, after a brief delay while the Supreme Court considered an appeal for a last-minute stay. Tamayo, 46, was convicted in 1994 of shooting and killing Houston police officer Guy Gaddis, 24, who had arrested him on suspicion of robbery. Secretary of State had asked that the case be reviewed, as had the Mexican government, which argued that Tamayo was never told of his right to diplomatic assistance under an international treaty.

8. Sperm donor told to pay child support

A judge ruled Wednesday that Kansas sperm donor, William Marotta, must pay child support. Shawnee County District Court Judge Mary Mattivi said Marotta was more than a sperm donor because no licensed physician was involved in the artificial insemination. Marotta donated sperm to a lesbian couple who placed an ad online. He said in court that he should not be responsible for a girl born to the couple in 2009 because he waived his parental rights, but the state child welfare department disagreed. [Associated Press]

9. The U.S. military plans to let soldiers wear religious garb

The Pentagon said Wednesday it would start letting soldiers wear turbans, head scarves, yarmulkes, and other religious clothing with their uniforms — even grow beards if their faith calls for it. Advocates said the policy didn't go far enough though, because service men and women will still have to ask permission. Ibrahim Hooper of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said if the policy is not widely accepted but left to "the whim of individual commanders" it won't be much of an improvement. [Reuters]
