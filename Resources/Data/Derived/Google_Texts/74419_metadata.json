The Loveland native was commissioned by the Rocky Mountain Conservancy to create a poster celebrating Rocky Mountain National Park's centennial. ( Kenneth Jessen / Special to the Reporter-Herald )\n\nThis is Rocky Mountain National Park's official centennial poster that depicts a majestic ram and the park's highest mountain, Longs Peak. (Courtesy of Jim Disney)\n\nCommissioned by the Rocky Mountain Conservancy (formerly the Rocky Mountain Nature Association), Jim Disney was selected to create a poster that celebrates Rocky Mountain National Park's centennial.\n\nDisney combined a majestic ram with Longs Peak in the background with a dramatic sky to represent the park in all of its splendor. And why not since Disney has reached the summit of Longs Peak nearly 100 times! In addition, he has been Artist in Residence twice and has climbed all 128 named peaks in the park, many of them twice.\n\nOf this honor, Disney says, \"For 50 years, I have been very fortunate to share my love of Rocky Mountain National Park with my paintings and photographs, so to have my artwork on the official centennial poster is a great honor.\"\n\nThis Loveland native started his professional career as an artist in 1963, and his work has been shown all over the United States. He has been heralded as a great landscape artist, with museums and collectors seeking his work.\n\nHis paintings have concentrated on landscape images of Rocky Mountain National Park, the Indian Peaks Wilderness and other Colorado mountain subjects. In 2011, the Colorado Mountain Club for its centennial, selected paintings and drawings done by Disney for a book \"100 Years Up High.\"\n\nDisney has served as Open Lands Visual Artist for Larimer County and in addition, he completed two terms as a Larimer County commissioner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrinted on durable paper, the centennial poster is available at the park's visitors centers for $7. Disney will be signing his poster on Wednesday at Hidden Valley and on Thursday at the Holzwarth Historic Site as part of the kick-off celebration.\n\nSee nps.gov/romo/planyourvisit/events.htm for more information.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/loveland-art/ci_26448502/jim-disney-helps-celebrate-rocky-mountain-national-park", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/0901/20140901__03rhbartw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Kenneth Jessen \n \n  For the Reporter-Herald", "description": "Commissioned by the Rocky Mountain Conservancy (formerly the Rocky Mountain Nature Association), Jim Disney was selected to create a poster that celebrates Rocky Mountain National Park's centennial.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:26448502:view"}, "startDate": "2014-09-01T21:08:26-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/loveland-art/ci_26448502/jim-disney-helps-celebrate-rocky-mountain-national-park", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/0901/20140901__03rhbartw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Commissioned by the Rocky Mountain Conservancy (formerly the Rocky Mountain Nature Association), Jim Disney was selected to create a poster that celebrates Rocky Mountain National Park's centennial.", "title": "Jim Disney helps celebrate Rocky Mountain National Park anniversary"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "Commissioned by the Rocky Mountain Conservancy (formerly the Rocky Mountain Nature Association), Jim Disney was selected to create a poster that celebrates Rocky Mountain National Park's centennial.", "title": "Jim Disney helps celebrate Rocky Mountain National Park anniversary", "url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/loveland-art/ci_26448502/jim-disney-helps-celebrate-rocky-mountain-national-park", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/0901/20140901__03rhbartw~1.jpg", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-09-01T21:08:26-0600", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "Jim Disney helps celebrate Rocky Mountain National Park anniversary", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/0901/20140901__03rhbartw~1.jpg", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Art", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "modificationDate": "2014-09-02T17:34:26-0600", "endDate": "2024-09-01T21:08:26-0600", "byline": "By Kenneth JessenFor", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "pubDate": "2014-09-01T21:09:35-0600", "news_keywords": "Loveland Colorado ReporterHerald art theater dance music classical visual events"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3b38\"", "article_summary": "(Courtesy of Jim Disney)Commissioned by the Rocky Mountain Conservancy (formerly the Rocky Mountain Nature Association), Jim Disney was selected to create a poster that celebrates Rocky Mountain National Park's centennial.\nThe Loveland native was commissioned by the Rocky Mountain Conservancy to create a poster celebrating Rocky Mountain National Park's centennial.\nHis paintings have concentrated on landscape images of Rocky Mountain National Park, the Indian Peaks Wilderness and other Colorado mountain subjects.\n( Kenneth Jessen / Special to the Reporter-Herald )This is Rocky Mountain National Park's official centennial poster that depicts a majestic ram and the park's highest mountain, Longs Peak.\nOf this honor, Disney says, \"For 50 years, I have been very fortunate to share my love of Rocky Mountain National Park with my paintings and photographs, so to have my artwork on the official centennial poster is a great honor.\""}
