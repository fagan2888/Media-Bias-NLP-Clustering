Workers hope to negotiate for higher pay and better healthcare and retirement plans but are concerned about beginning negotiations with a completely different company than before.\n\nSodexo has been criticized for its labor practices in the past. A 2011 report by the human rights organization TransAfrica found that American Sodexo workers earn so little that they qualified for federal anti-poverty programs and were often denied overtime. The report also cited a Human Rights Watch report that claimed Sodexo \u201claunched aggressive campaigns against some of its U.S. employees\u2019 rights to form unions and bargain collectively.\u201d Sodexo has denied these allegations. A May 22, 2014 Boston Globe column accused Sodexo of using the Affordable Care Act as an excuse to cut employee benefits, as well as altering calculations for full and part-time work to similarly cut benefits. Sodexo claimed that it had to change its calculations due to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBrandeis workers have been acting under a contract first negotiated with Aramark for the last five years. It expires on June 30. Sodexo workers are waiting for the company to propose dates for negotiations with UNITE HERE Local 26, the union representing Brandeis dining workers. If the contract expires before a new contract can be agreed upon, workers\u2019 wages and healthcare premiums will freeze at their current levels, but they will gain the rights to picket and strike. If a new contract is then reached after the old one expires, workers will be retroactively reimbursed for the raises they should have gotten. Wage raises are dated every July and January.\n\nIn an interview with the Justice, the three shop stewards for dining workers at Brandeis \u2014 Milagros Santana, Mike Cutler and Lucia Hsiung, who spoke on behalf of the workers to UNITE HERE Local 26 \u2014 said that workers hope to at least maintain their current healthcare and retirement plans but expressed concerns about benefits like sick leave and vacations. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned that if they want to start slashing, they may start touching that element of our benefits,\u201d Santana said.\n\n\u201cWe need at least another five years of feeling secure at your job. Knowing that you can pay your bills and be able to take care of your family members,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re with these kids four years,\u201d Cutler added. \u201cYou get to know a lot of the kids, they want to see you earn a fair wage and a fair living. We\u2019ve got a lot of students now backing us. It\u2019s good to have support.\u201d Cutler said that he believes some workers may not stay if the current contract disappears and that long-time workers may not have stayed as long as they did without the contract. Cutler has worked for the University for nine years as a cook, while Santana has been a cashier for 10 and Hsiung has been a cook for 15.\n\nThe contract would not impact student workers, but it would affect other part-time and full-time Sodexo workers. Andrew Nguyen \u201915, UNITE HERE\u2019s representative in charge of Brandeis, said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen that the workers are willing to fight and stand up for themselves, and they not only deserve respect, but they\u2019re willing to fight for that.\u201d Nguyen was also a member of the Brandeis Labor Coalition while an undergraduate. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased with him,\u201d Cutler said. \u201cHe\u2019s here more than we\u2019ve ever seen any other union person here, that\u2019s for sure. And we fed him for four years!\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://d105g71axwt19k.cloudfront.net/20151020Q1lKKcadsg/dist/img/favicon/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Dining services workers will soon begin healthcare and retirement plan negotiations with Sodexo.", "generator": "Gryphon 20160217001 (Foundry 6.1-20150615001)", "og": {"site_name": "The Justice", "description": "Dining services workers will soon begin healthcare and retirement plan negotiations with Sodexo.", "title": "Dining services workers to start negotiations", "url": "http://www.thejustice.org/article/2016/04/dining-negotiations", "image": "http://d105g71axwt19k.cloudfront.net/20151020Q1lKKcadsg/dist/img/fb-hidden-icon.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "thejustice.org", "site": "@thejustice", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://d105g71axwt19k.cloudfront.net/20151020Q1lKKcadsg/dist/img/favicon/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Sodexo workers are waiting for the company to propose dates for negotiations with UNITE HERE Local 26, the union representing Brandeis dining workers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re concerned that if they want to start slashing, they may start touching that element of our benefits,\u201d Santana said.\nThe contract would not impact student workers, but it would affect other part-time and full-time Sodexo workers.\nDining services workers to start negotiationsBy Max Moran | Published 04/05/16 3:56am | Updated 04/05/16 3:56amDining services workers will soon begin their first contract negotiations with Sodexo since the company took over from Aramark as the University\u2019s main food provider in the 2013 to 2014 academic year.\nBrandeis workers have been acting under a contract first negotiated with Aramark for the last five years."}
