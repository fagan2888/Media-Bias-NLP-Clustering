Our love for Thom Filicia knows no bounds. We've followed his star climb from the "Queer Eye For The Straight Guy" days to his current status as a designer at the very top of his profession. Now, he's revealed one of his latest projects, which happens to be a former camp in Upstate New York.

However, this isn't the camp that comes to mind at the mention of the word. It's a magnificent property nestled in the Adirondack mountains that, quite simply, is the opposite of "roughing it." Located in an area where Gilded Age tycoons once vacationed, the compound sits on a peninsula that was once home to the Wawbeek resort. Filicia, along with architect Arthur Hanlon of the Connecticut firm Shope Reno Wharton, re-imagined the great camp as a family-friendly retreat where nearly every room has a jaw-dropping view.

Filicia approached the interior design with an eye for rustic flourishes. Natural materials inspired by the region, such as fieldstone (used for the fireplaces) and birch logs (which are used for the balusters), feel at home against the blue, green and brown paint palette. Yet, the look doesn't seem overly thematic, thanks to wordly accessories such as Indonesian side chairs, along with Moroccan and Turkish carpets. Overall, the home has a calm, relaxed air that's the perfect antidote for a stressful day. For an even closer look, visit our friends at Architectural Digest.
